         <title>Triple Regulations via Fe Redox Boosting Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) has promising prospects for green synthesis of ammonia and environmental remediation. However, the performance of catalysts at high current density usually suffers from the high energy barrier for the nitrate (NO3&#8208;) to nitrite (NO2&#8208;) and the competitive hydrogen evolution. Herein, we proposed a two&#8208;step relay mechanism through spontaneous redox reaction followed electrochemical reaction by introducing low&#8208;valence Fe species into Ni2P nanosheets to significantly enhance the NO3&#8208;RR performance at industrial current density. The existence of low&#8208;valence Fe species bypasses the NO3&#8208; to NO2&#8208; step through the spontaneous redox with NO3&#8208; to produce NO2&#8208; and Fe2O3, regulates the electronic structure of Ni2P to reduce the barrier of NO2&#8208; to NH3, thirdly prohibits the hydrogen evolution by consuming the excess active hydrogen through reduction of Fe2O3 to recover low&#8208;valence Fe species. The triple regulations via Fe redox during the two&#8208;step relay reactions guarantee the Fe&#8208;Ni2P@NF high ammonia yield of 120.1 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 with Faraday efficiency of more than 90% over a wide potential window and a long&#8208;term stability of more than 130 h at ~1000 mA cm&#8208;2. This work provides a new strategy to realize the design and synthesis of nitrate reduction electrocatalysts at high current densities.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3-RR) has promising prospects for green synthesis of ammonia and environmental remediation. However, the performance of catalysts at high current density usually suffers from the high energy barrier for the nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite (NO2-) and the competitive hydrogen evolution. Herein, we proposed a two-step relay mechanism through spontaneous redox reaction followed electrochemical reaction by introducing low-valence Fe species into Ni2P nanosheets to significantly enhance the NO3-RR performance at industrial current density. The existence of low-valence Fe species bypasses the NO3- to NO2- step through the spontaneous redox with NO3- to produce NO2- and Fe2O3, regulates the electronic structure of Ni2P to reduce the barrier of NO2- to NH3, thirdly prohibits the hydrogen evolution by consuming the excess active hydrogen through reduction of Fe2O3 to recover low-valence Fe species. The triple regulations via Fe redox during the two-step relay reactions guarantee the Fe-Ni2P@NF high ammonia yield of 120.1 mg h-1 cm-2 with Faraday efficiency of more than 90% over a wide potential window and a long-term stability of more than 130 h at ~1000 mA cm-2. This work provides a new strategy to realize the design and synthesis of nitrate reduction electrocatalysts at high current densities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Helicene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Inductor and Capacitor with Frequency&#8208;Dependent Charge&#8208;Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive studies has been explored on single&#8208;molecule switches and rectifiers, the design of single&#8208;molecule inductors has not been explored due to the experimental challenges in the investigation of frequency&#8208;dependent charge transport at the single&#8208;molecule scale. In this study, we synthesized a helicene&#8208;based helical molecular wire and carried out meticulous single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, combined with current&#8208;voltage (IV) studies with varying frequencies using the scanning tunneling microscope break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Our results reveal the formation of a single&#8208;molecule junction and highlight the unique behavior of the molecular wire in response to different alternating current (AC) varying frequencies. The transport of charges occurs selectively either through the coiled backbone of the conjugated helical structure or vertically via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, depending on the frequency of the applied AC. Notably, our investigation demonstrates the functionality of the wire as an inductor at low frequencies, and a capacitor at high frequencies. This work lays the foundation for a systematic approach to designing, fabricating, and implementing single&#8208;molecule logic devices such as inductors and wave filters.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic tuning of microstructure and morphology in carbon molecular sieve hollow fibers for propylene/propane separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric carbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fiber membranes with tunable micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structural morphologies for energy efficient propylene&#8208;propane separation are reported here.&#160; A sub&#8208;glass transition temperature (sub&#8208;Tg) thermal oxidative crosslinking strategy enables simultaneous optimization of the intrinsic molecular sieving properties while also reducing the thickness of the CMS &#8220;skin&#8221; derived from the 6FDA:BPDA/DAM polyimide precursors. Such synergistic tuning of CMS microstructure and macroscopic morphology of CMS hollow fibers enables significantly increased propylene permeance (reaching 186.5 GPU) while maintaining an appealing propylene/propane selectivity of 13.3 for 50/50 propylene/propane mixed gas feeds. Our findings reveal a more refined and versatile tool than available with previous O2&#8208;doping pretreatments. The advanced approach here should be broadly useful to other polyimide precursors and diverse gas pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Propane Dehydrogenation on PtxZny Active Sites in Silicalite&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The improvement of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has progressed by recent investigations that have identified Zn as a promising promoter for Pt subnanometer catalysts. It is desirable to gain insights into the structure, stability, and activity of such active sites and the factors that influence them, such as Zn:Pt ratio, Pt coordination and nuclearity. Here, we employ density functional theory and microkinetic simulations to investigate the stability of PtxZny (x=1&#8208;3, y=0&#8208;3) active sites grafted on silanols of Silicalite&#8208;1 and the PDH activity of Pt. We find that the coordination of a Pt atom to a nest of grafted Zn(II) atoms increases the stability of the Pt1Zny sites, whose activity is similar for y=0&#8208;2 and drops dramatically for y&gt;2. We further demonstrate, via linear scaling relations and microkinetic simulations, that the turnover frequency obeys a volcano law as a function of propylene binding strength. The Pt2Zn1 and Pt3Zn1 sites are stable and exhibit activity similar to Pt1Zn2, but only Pt1Zn2 manifests reaction kinetics consistent with experimental data, strongly suggesting the active site composition in the synthesized catalyst samples. The methodology presented here suggests a general strategy for deducing active site information such as composition through simple kinetic experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst&#8217;s electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Induced Flexible and Twisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functionalized Carbon Dots with Customized&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is widely applied in optical data storage, quantum computing and backlights in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. Carbon dots (CDs) exhibit competitive optical properties, in addition to excellent resistance to photo&#8208; and chemical&#8208;bleaching after carbonization. Combining the superior optical performance with polarization peculiarities through hierarchical structure engineering is imperative for the development of CDs. Here, oriented assembly was driven by hydrophobic interactions of aromatic ligands, which participated in the surface&#8208;ligand post&#8208;modification process on ground&#8208;state chiral carbon core. Furthermore, the residual chiral amides on CDs formed multi&#8208;hydrogen bonds during gradual aggregation, causing the assembled materials to form asymmetric bending structure. Superficial ligands interfered with optical dynamics of exciton radiation transition and promoted the excited state of the assembled materials to achieve a circularly polarized signal. The linkage ligands successfully overcame the frequent phenomenon of aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and contributed further to the formation of self&#8208;supporting films by assembly and facilitated chiral optical expression. The full&#8208;color and white CPL were manipulated by simply regulating the functional groups on the ligands. Finally, based on the stable chiral powder phosphors, large chiral flexible films and multicolor chiral light&#8208;emitting diodes were constructed which provide feasible materials and technical support for flexible 3D displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Carbodiimide (MnNCN): A New Heterogeneous Mn Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of Nitriles from Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant manganese oxides (MnOx) were competitive candidates when screening catalysts for ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles due to their redox property. However, over&#8208;oxidation and possible acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles into amides still limited the application of MnOx in nitrile synthesis. In this work, manganese carbodiimide (MnNCN) was first reported to be robust for the ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and the hydrolysis. Besides the high activity and selectivity, MnNCN demonstrated wide substrate scope including the ammoxidation of primary alcohols into nitriles, the oxidative C&#8208;C bonds cleavage and ammoxidation of secondary alcohols, phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols, and diols into nitriles. Controlled experiments and DFT calculation results revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of MnNCN originated from its high ability in the activation of O2 molecules, and favorable oxidative dehydrogenation of C=N bonds in the aldimine intermediates (RCH=NH) into nitriles, inhibiting the competitive side reaction of the oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acids, followed to amide byproducts. Moreover, the hydrolysis of nitriles was also inhibited over MnNCN for its weak acidity as compared with MnOx. This study provided new insights into Mn&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidations as a highly important complement to manganese oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach for Accessing 3D Heterocycles via 1,2&#8208;Dicyanation of Planar N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic frameworks is a key challenge in contemporary medicinal chemistry. The molecules with three&#8208;dimensional complexity hold a greater probability to improve clinical outcomes, solubility, selectivity for target proteins, and metabolic stability. However, the prevalence of flat molecules persists among new drug candidates, primarily owing to the multitude of chemical methods available for their synthesis. In principle, the dearomative functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene allows for the conversion of readily available planar molecules into partially or fully saturated nitrogen heterocycles, which are most significant structural motifs of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Unfortunately, these reactions are very rare because of the inherent challenge imposed by heteroarenes&#8217; poor reactivity, rendering the process thermodynamically unfavorable. Herein, we report a modular approach for accessing 3D chemical space in translating planar heteroarenes into valuable 3D heterocycles via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector. This approach is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive, non&#8208;symmetric iodane by combining cyanide anion and bench&#8208;stable PhI(OAc)2. This reaction represents a rare example of 1,2&#8208;dicyanation of N&#8208;heteroarenes that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug and agrochemical discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Confined Organic Butterfly&#8208;Molecule with High Photoluminescence Efficiency, Deep&#8208;Blue Amplified Spontaneous Emission, and Unique Piezochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic fluorophores with tunable &#960;&#8208;conjugated paths have attracted considerable attention owing to their diverse properties and promising applications. Herein, we present a tailored butterfly like molecule, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(2,5&#8208;bis (2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)dinaphtha&#8208;lene (BDVPN), which exhibits diverse photophysical features in its two polymorphs. The BP phase crystal, with its &#8220;aligned wings&#8221; conformation, possesses emissive characteristics that are nearly identical to those in dilute solutions. In contrast, the BN phase crystal, which adopts an &#8220;orthogonal wings&#8221; conformation, exhibits an unusual hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission compared to its dilute solution counterparts. This intriguing hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission originates from the reduction in the effective conjugated length of the molecular skeleton. Notably, BN phase crystals also exhibit exceptional optical performance, featuring high&#8208;efficiency emission (76.6%), low&#8208;loss optical waveguides (0.571 dB mm&#8208;1), deep&#8208;blue amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM: 6.4 nm), and a unique 200 nm bathochromic shift of piezochromic luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Induced by Mercury Ions through Binaphthyl Dopants' Conjugation Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials based on cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms show great promise for applications in information encryption and anticounterfeiting. In this study, we constructed a mercury ion&#8208;responsive CPL system in CLCs by controlling the conjugation degree of axially chiral binaphthyl derivatives. Two chiral binaphthyl derivatives (R/S&#8208;1 and R/S&#8208;2) were initially used as chiral dopants to demonstrate that CPL inversion (glum values from 0.5/&#8208;0.44 to &#8208;0.53/0.48) in CLCs could be achieved by modulating the conjugation degree of the chiral binaphthyls. Based on this concept, the thioacetal binaphthyl R&#8208;2S was developed and used as a mercury&#8208;responsive chiral dopant in CLCs. Under Hg ion treatment, the CPL sign inverted (glum value changed from 0.22 to &#8208;0.29) due to the transformation of the thioacetal into an aldehyde group. Additionally, the mercury ion&#8208;responsive CPL material was applied in information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Imaging of Renin Activity using Fluorogenic Nanoprobes for Precision Antihypertensive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life&#8208;threatening hypertension remains inadequately controlled in clinics due to its heterogenous renin levels. Rapid stratification of hypertension through renin analysis is crucial for effective personalized treatment, yet an ultrasensitive detection approach is currently lacking. Here, we report activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) for non&#8208;invasive and ultrasensitive profiling of renin activity and guiding antihypertensive treatment decision through near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging and in vitro urinalysis. ARNs are intrinsically non&#8208;fluorescent due to NIRF reporter connected to a gold nanocluster through a renin&#8208;responsive peptide. In hyperreninemia mouse models, ARNs specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter for accurate renin detection that outperforms the gold standard radioimmunoassay. Such specific and sensitive detection also enables imaging&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening of antihypertensive drugs. In hypertensive rat models, ARNs enable ultrasensitive detection of both plasma and urinary renin, facilitating renin&#8208;guided precision treatment and significantly improving hypertension control rate (90% versus 58%). Our nanoprobe platform holds great potential for assisting clinicians in rapidly and accurately classifying hypertensive patients and improving outcomes through tailored treatment selection.</dc:description>

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict the Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cone angles of anions correlate with the affinity and reactivity of their complexes akin to Tolman cone angles seen in cation coordination. This behavior is exemplified with binding rigid organo&#8208;trifluoroborate (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) anions to rigid cyanostar macrocycles and expected to be general for other rigid pairs. Use of cone angles allow predictions, with affinities agreeing to within 5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of the anion's reactivity and how it changes upon binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10&#8197;anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized &#945;&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2&#8197;hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8722;BF3&#8722; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF3&#8722; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small&#8208;Scale Chemical Reactors and Liquid Microprinters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets of various solvents can levitate for days to weeks over the same or another liquid spread over the walls of a rotating vial. Individual or multiple droplets can be levitated, and can be used as &#8220;airware&#8221; reactors or as &#8220;wireless&#8221; chemical printers requiring no external connections to deliver into a reaction mixture fL volumes and pg quantities of reagents.







Abstract
A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall&#8208;less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching&#8212;by remote impulses&#8212;to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world's smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wireless aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces. The &#8220;airware&#8221;, levitated reactors are inexpensive to set up, remarkably stable to external disturbances and, for printing applications, require operating voltages much lower than in electrospray, electrowetting, or ink jet systems.

         <title>Photoinduced C(sp3)&#8722;H Bicyclopentylation Enabled by an Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Mediated Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Radical Relay</title>

A photoinduced and electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component C(sp3)&#8722;H bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;arylation of glycine derivatives was developed. This protocol demonstrated efficacy in synthesizing diverse unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP motifs and enabled the late&#8208;stage integration of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCPs into peptides, applicable to both liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions.







Abstract
The photoredox electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated radical coupling reaction has gained prominence in the field of organic synthesis, finding widespread application in two&#8208;component coupling reactions. However, EDA complex&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component reactions are not well developed with only a limited number of examples have been reported. Herein, we report a photoinduced and EDA complex&#8208;promoted highly chemoselective three&#8208;component radical arylalkylation of [1.1.1]propellane, which allows the direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;aryl groups under mild conditions. A variety of unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, featuring structurally diversified 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties, were synthesized in a single&#8208;step process. Notably, leveraging the high tension release of [1.1.1]propellane, the highly unstable transient aryl radical undergoes rapid conversion into a relatively stable tertiary alkyl transient radical, and consequently, the competing side&#8208;reaction of two&#8208;component coupling was entirely suppressed. The strategic use of this transient radical conversion approach would be useful for the design of diverse EDA complex&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;component reactions. It is noteworthy that the highly chemoselective late&#8208;stage incorporation of the 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP pharmacophores into peptides was achieved both in liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions. This advancement is anticipated to have significant application potential in the future development of peptide drugs.

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral Electrocatalysts Enable Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst has been presented for the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. The new bifunctional catalyst, which combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator, significantly enhances efficiencies and stereoselectivities compared to conventional catalysts. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an innovative approach to the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes facilitated by a newly designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst. The highly efficient bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation, while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. Additionally, this novel catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stereoselective control comparable to conventional catalytic systems. As a result, this strategy provides a new avenue for versatile asymmetric electrochemistry. The electrooxidation of diverse phenols enables the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies by control experiments and cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrate possible reaction pathways and the origin of enantio&#8208;induction.

         <title>Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots originating from cellulose confined in a silica matrix result in long afterglow emission indicating formation of triplet states. Their use as sensitizer in radical photopolymerization results either in free radical polymerization or controlled radical polymerization based on a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol depending on the composition. Metal&#8208;free setup indicated less uniformity while a trace of CuBr2/TPMA resulted in dispersity approaching to unity depending on concentration.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose carbon dots (CMCCDs), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in CMCCDs@SiO2. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra gave information on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo&#8208;ATRP initiator, ethyl &#945;&#8208;bromophenylacetate (EBPA), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Both free radical and controlled radical polymerization based on photo&#8208;ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either MMA or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9&#8197;ppm Cu2+ resulted in Mw/Mn of 1.4 while an increase to 72&#8197;ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is Mw/Mn=1.03. Complementary experiments with kerria laca carbon dots confined materials, namely KCDs@SiO2, provided similar results. Deposition of Cu2+ (9&#8197;ppm) on the photocatalyst surface explains better uniformity of the polymers formed in the ATRP protocol.

Regulating the crystal surface energy and optimizing the crystallization dynamics realized blade&#8208;coating of (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for 24.16&#8201;% efficient inverted perovskite solar cells with extended lifespan.







Abstract
Photoactive black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites during film formation. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8722;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42&#8201;%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Benefited from multifaceted advantages of promoted charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, the resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16&#8201;% (~26.5&#8201;% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH) stabilizes the Zn anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling stable cycling of the Zn anode with a maximum area capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a ZUR of 97&#8201;%. At the same time, a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in the four&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is achieved through a bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. The four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 97&#8201;% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) with 15&#8201;% CO2/5&#8201;% O2/80&#8201;% N2 gas mixture and achieve 11&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgBr2 and 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgCl2 compared to 15&#8201;% CO2/85&#8201;% N2 gas mixture. A tradeoff between sorption capacity and energy efficiency was observed.







Abstract
We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11&#8197;times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgBr2 (at 0.6&#8197;V) and up to 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgCl2 (at 1&#8197;V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6&#8197;V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5&#8197;V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1&#8197;V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8211;20&#8201;% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100&#8197;cycles of operation.

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular electrostatic stabilization in zwitterionic moieties plays a critical role in their reactive stability. The stabilization potential is demonstrated to have a unique spatial orientation dependence in zwitterionic head groups of surfactants and lipids. This feature has been used to generate triggerable supramolecular assembly formation and their disassembly.







Abstract
The consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid head groups. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.

We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Syngas Production from Natural Lignin, Sunlight, and Water over Pt&#8208;Decorated InGaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven green syngas production from natural lignin and water is achieved over Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires supported by a silicon substrate. Photo&#8208;excited charges play a critical role in the generation of &#8901;CH3 from lignin and &#8901;OH from water, followed by the formation of syngas. The study shows a promising route for the carbon&#8208;neutral production of transportation fuels and valuable chemicals beyond fossil fuels.







Abstract
Transformation of lignin to syngas can turn waste into treasure yet remains a tremendous challenge because of its naturally evolved stubborn structure. In this work, light&#8208;driven reforming of natural lignin in water for green syngas production is explored using Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires. The spectroscopic characterizations, isotope, and model compound experiments, as well as density function theory calculation, disclose that among a variety of groups including aromatic ring, &#8722;OH, &#8722;OCH3, &#8722;C3H7 with complex chemical bonds of O&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, etc., InGaN nanowires are cooperative with Pt for preferably breaking the C&#8722;O bond of the rich O&#8722;CH3 group in lignin to liberating &#8901;CH3 by photogenerated holes with a minimum dissociation energy of 2.33&#8197;eV. Syngas are subsequently yielded from the continuous evolution of &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH from photocatalytic reforming of lignin in water. Together with the superior optoelectronic attributes of Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires, the evolution rate of syngas approaches 43.4&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with tunable H2/CO ratios and a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 150, 543&#8197;mol syngas per mol Pt. Notably, the architecture demonstrates a high light efficiency of 12.1&#8201;% for syngas generation under focused light without any extra thermal input. Outdoor test ascertains the viability of producing syngas with the only inputs of natural lignin, water, and sunlight, thus presenting a low&#8208;carbon route for synthesizing transportation fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Chemical Reaction Modulated Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Toward Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional azure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), with a peak external quantum efficiency of more than 16&#8201;%, are developed by optimizing the energy cascade process between low&#8208;dimensional phases, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, through the inclusion of multifunctional molecular additives.







Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are crucial avenues for achieving full&#8208;color displays and lighting based on perovskite materials. However, the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) has hindered their progression towards commercial applications. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites stand out as promising candidates for blue PeLEDs, with optimized control over low&#8208;dimensional phases contributing to enhanced radiative properties of excitons. Herein, the impact of organic molecular dopants on the crystallization of various n&#8208;phase structures in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. The results reveal that the highly reactive bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (BTF&#8208;PPO) molecule could effectively restrain the formation of organic spacer cation&#8208;ordered layered perovskite phases through chemical reactions, simultaneously passivate those uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the prepared PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 16.6&#8201;% (@ 490&#8197;nm). The finding provides a new route to design dopant molecules for phase modulation in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs.

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>

         <dc:description>
The 3MLCT&#8594;3MC barrier determines the excited state lifetime of iron(II) photosensitizers. In the specifically designed tetracarbene iron(II) complex with cis&#8208;coordinated pyridines, a single Fe&#8722;N bond elongates in the excited triplet states. Variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy delivered the barrier and the electronic coupling between 3MLCT and 3MC states providing novel design criteria for iron(II) sensitizers.







Abstract
Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.

         <dc:description>
Two polymorphic copper&#8208;based hybrid halides &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy visible light emission were obtained. The centrosymmetric to noncentroysmmetic structural transformation between them is induced by the distortion of [CuI3] triangular anions and packing mode of organic cations. Especially, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits multi&#8208;properties including bright cyan emission with 100&#8201;% PLQY, phase&#8208;matchable SHG effect and outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8722; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8722; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy/s).

     alt="Near Ultraviolet-Excitable Cyan-Emissive Hybrid Copper(I) Halides Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Near-Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and High-Efficiency X-ray Scintillation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two polymorphic copper-based hybrid halides &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with broadband-excited high-energy visible light emission were obtained. The centrosymmetric to noncentroysmmetic structural transformation between them is induced by the distortion of [CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] triangular anions and packing mode of organic cations. Especially, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits multi-properties including bright cyan emission with 100&#8201;% PLQY, phase-matchable SHG effect and outstanding X-ray scintillation properties.

&lt;p&gt;Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light-excited high-energy emission (&amp;lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband-excited high-energy emitting isomers, namely, &lt;i&gt;&#945;-&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;&#946;-&lt;/i&gt;(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &lt;i&gt;&#945;-&lt;/i&gt;(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;. While &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; featuring distorted [CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits phase-matchable second-harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also can be excited by X-ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra-low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;Gy/s).

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thienopyrazine&#8208;based organic molecules as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) were developed and deposited on NiOx films for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using NiOx as interlayer can modify the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ITO substrate. The two&#8208;step method was applied to enable better quality of the tin perovskite layer grown on the NiOx/SAM substrates, ultimately achieving a power conversion efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx as HTM, the TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7&#8201;% for TP&#8208;MN (1). Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups and NiOx as HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80&#8201;% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#8197;h.

         <title>Ultrafast and Coherent Dynamics in a Solvent Switchable &#8220;Pink Box&#8221; Perylene Diimide Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast coherent multidimensional spectroscopy probes photoinduced dynamics in a covalent perylene diimide (PDI) dimer exhibiting solvent&#8208;controlled on/off excitonic coupling. Excitonic coupling leads to ultrafast excimer formation. The coupling dependent population and vibrationally coherent dynamics in the two cases are measured and discussed in the context of controlling PDI dimer photophysics.







Abstract
Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300&#8197;fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Partitioned Self&#8208;Assembled Cage for Sequential Separation in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partitioned cavity of cage 1 demonstrates a high degree of molecular&#8208;specific recognition, enabling its application not only in the separation of adamantane derivatives but also in the progressive separation of multi&#8208;component polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the reversible binding between the redox&#8208;active guest and 1 is achieved through precise regulation of the reduction/oxidation state of the guest via electrochemical stimulation.







Abstract
The concept of pore space partition has emerged as an effective strategy for developing improved coordination&#8208;based supramolecular porous materials with exceptional performance. Herein, we report that a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled tetrahedral cage 1 with a partitioned cavity shown excellent performance as a multifunctional extractant. The results show that this unique partitioned cavity can efficiently separate halogenated adamantanes, adamantane isomers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the influence of cavity&#8208;partitioned cage 1 on the electrochemical properties of redox&#8208;active molecules and electrochemically driven reversible host&#8211;guest process has also been demonstrated. The findings offer valuable insights into the design and development of new type of materials with controlled phase separation and tailored electrochemical properties.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C3N4 Triggers Selective H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) catalyst causes the in&#8208;plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H2O2.







Abstract
For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H2O2 production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho&#8208;S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-doped defect-rich graphitic carbon nitride (S-Nv-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst causes the in-plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

17&#8208;nor&#8208;Cephalotane diterpenoids include two categories, Cephalotaxus troponoids and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, which possess polycyclic frameworks with seven&#8208;membered A ring bearing different oxidation states. We report herein a novel ynol&#8208;diene cyclization as a rapid access to tropone unit. Combining with a bioinspired stereoselective dual hydrogenation, the first divergent strategy to both categories of 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids has been successfully established, which enabled the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus troponoids, (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid F and (+)&#8208;harringtonolide, and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;fortalpinoids M/N/P and analog (&#8722;)&#8208;20&#8208;deoxocephinoid P, in 14&#8211;17 linear longest steps starting from commercially available materials.

         <title>Allenamides as a Powerful Tool to Incorporate Diversity: Thia&#8208;Michael Lipidation of Semisynthetic Peptides and Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenamides are demonstrated as a peptide modification tool that enables late&#8208;stage access to chemically diverse bioactive lipopeptides prepared by semisynthesis and to &#946;&#8208;keto amide&#8208;functionalised peptides, which serve as versatile building blocks for further derivatisation.







Abstract
Lipopeptides are an important class of biomolecules for drug development. Compared with conventional acylation, a chemoselective lipidation strategy offers a more efficient strategy for late&#8208;stage structural derivatisation of a peptide scaffold. It provides access to chemically diverse compounds possessing intriguing and non&#8208;native moieties. Utilising an allenamide, we report the first semisynthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides leveraging a highly efficient thia&#8208;Michael addition of chemically diverse lipophilic thiols. Using chemoenzymatically prepared polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a model scaffold, an optimised allenamide&#8208;mediated thia&#8208;Michael addition effected rapid and near quantitative lipidation, affording vinyl sulfide&#8208;linked lipopeptide derivatives. Harnessing the utility of this new methodology, 22&#8197;lipophilic thiols of unprecedented chemical diversity were introduced to the PMBN framework. These included alkyl thiols, substituted aromatic thiols, heterocyclic thiols and those bearing additional functional groups (e.g., amines), ultimately yielding analogues with potent Gram&#8208;negative antimicrobial activity and substantially attenuated nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, we report facile routes to transform the allenamide into a &#946;&#8208;keto amide on unprotected peptides, offering a powerful &#8220;jack&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades&#8221; synthetic intermediate to enable further peptide modification.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Multichannel Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the origins of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane. This approach enabled elucidation of the chiroptical signals originating from either the topological or Euclidean chirality in these chiral molecules.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) are promising platforms for developing functionalized artificial molecular machines. The construction of chiral MIMs with appealing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties has boosted their potential application in biomedicine and the optical industry. However, there is currently little knowledge about the CPL emission mechanism or the emission dynamics of these related MIMs. Herein, we demonstrate that time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy offers a feasible approach to elucidate the origins of CPL emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane as well as in a series of pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules. For the first time, direct evidence differentiating the chiroptical signals originating from either topological (local state emission) or Euclidean chirality (excimer state emission) in these pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules has been discovered. Our work not only establishes a novel and ideal approach to study CPL mechanism, but also provides a theoretical foundation for the rational design of novel chiral materials in the future.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (BiSAs) loaded TiO2. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH). An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47&#177;0.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 (911.87&#177;5&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gBi&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8722;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8722;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical. The BiSAs sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the nucleophilic attack of &#8901;NH2 radical on the &#8901;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8722;N bond formation. This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8722;N coupling mechanism and offers an intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8722;N compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (Bi&lt;sub&gt;SAs&lt;/sub&gt;) loaded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formamide (HCONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon-nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co-oxidation of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH). An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47&#177;0.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Nonreducing Sugar Scaffold Enables the Development of Immunomodulatory TLR4&#8208;specific LPS Mimetics with Picomolar Potency</title>

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system play a central role in host defense and in the modulation of immune responses in infection, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Of the PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLR) are particularly important targets for the development of immunotherapies in a variety of inflammatory and oncological settings. TLR4&#8208;specific carbohydrate&#8208;based biomolecules capable of potently activating cellular responses or inhibiting TLR4&#8208;mediated inflammation were designed, chemically synthesised and immunobiologically evaluated.







Abstract
Innate immune defense mechanisms against infection and cancer encompass the modulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#8208;mediated inflammation, including upregulation of various transcription factors and the activation of pro&#8208;inflammatory pathways important for immune surveillance. Dysfunction of PRRs&#8208;mediated signaling has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases, while the overactivation of PRRs&#8208;driven responses during infection can lead to devastating consequences such as acute lung injury or sepsis. We used crystal structure&#8208;based design to develop immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimetics targeting one of the ubiquitous PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking advantage of an exo&#8208;anomeric conformation and specific molecular shape of synthetic nonreducing &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diglucosamine, which was investigated by NMR, we developed two sets of lipid A mimicking glycolipids capable of either potently activating innate immune responses or inhibiting pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling. Stereoselective 1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation towards fully orthogonally protected nonreducing GlcN&#946;(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN followed by stepwise assembly of differently functionalised phosphorylated glycolipids provided biologically active molecules that were evaluated for their ability to trigger or to inhibit cellular innate immune responses. Two LPS mimetics, identified as potent TLR4&#8208;specific inducers of the intracellular signaling pathways, serve as vaccine adjuvant&#8208; and immunotherapy candidates, while anionic glycolipids with TLR4&#8208;inhibitory potential hold therapeutic promise for the management of acute or chronic inflammation.

An endoperoxide compound (E5) spontaneously deliver three active agents and target multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone. In addition, triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is an important issue in many refractory cancers.







Abstract
We report an endoperoxide compound (E5) which can deliver three therapeutic components by a thermal cycloreversion, namely, singlet oxygen, triplet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (P5), thus targeting multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In aqueous environment, E5 undergoes clean reaction to afford three therapeutic components with a half&#8208;life of 8.3&#8197;hours without the generation of other by&#8208;products, which not only achieves good cytotoxicity toward lung cancer cells and decreases the levels of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) protein, but also inhibits the transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) induced fibrosis in vitro. In vivo experiments also demonstrated the efficacy of E5 in inhibiting tumor growth and relieving idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while exhibiting good biocompatibility. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone for these two lung diseases, and triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is a critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Unlike other combination therapies, in which multiple therapeutic agents are given in independent formulations, our work demonstrates single molecule endoperoxide prodrugs could be developed as new platforms for treatment of cancers and related diseases.

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning approach is used to derive a non&#8208;classical model that describes the crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.







Abstract
Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8722;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is achieved by precisely controlling the Cu&#8722;S bond length. By introducing a S&#8722;Sb covalent bond adjacent to the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond with S atom as a bridge, the Cu&#8722;S bond length is elongated, which affects the adsorption strength and characteristics of key intermediates, and further regulates the reaction pathway, thus driving the CO2RR primary product to switch from HCOOH to CO.







Abstract
Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8722;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8722;S bond from 2.24&#8197;&#197; to 2.30&#8197;&#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72&#8201;%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8722;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8722;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu&#8722;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.

         <title>Highly Stable Carboranyl Ligated Gold Nano&#8208;Catalysts for Regioselective Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboranes are disclosed to generate highly stable CB@AuNPs of core&#8208;satellite structures. They are capable of suppressing active species dissolution under harsh conditions and have realized regioselective bromination of unbiased arenes with p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities comparable if not superior to those in the best selective non&#8208;enzyme catalytic systems.







Abstract
Achieving electronic/steric control and realizing selectivity regulation in nanocatalysis remains a formidable challenge, as the dynamic nature of metal&#8208;ligand interfaces, including dissolution (metal leaching) and structural reconstruction, poses significant obstacles. Herein, we disclose carboranyls (CBs) as unprecedented carbon&#8208;bonded functional ligands (Eads.CB&#8208;Au(111)=&#8722;2.90&#8197;eV) for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), showcasing their exceptional stabilization capability that is attributed by strong Au&#8722;C bonds combined with B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The synthesized CB@AuNPs exhibit core(Aun)&#8208;satellite(CB2Au&#8722;) structure, showing high stability towards multiple stimuli (110&#8201;&#176;C, pH=1&#8211;12, thiol etchants). In addition, different from conventional AuNP catalysts such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) stabilized AuNPs, dissolution of catalytically active gold species was suppressed in CB@AuNPs under the reaction conditions. Leveraging these distinct features, CB@AuNPs realized outstanding p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities in aromatic bromination. Unbiased arenes including chlorobenzene (up to &gt;30&#8201;:&#8201;1), bromobenzene (15&#8201;:&#8201;1) and phenyl acrylate were examined using CB@AuNPs as catalysts to afford highly&#8208;selective p&#8208;products. Both carboranyl ligands and carboranyl derived counterions are crucial for such regioselective transformation. This work has provided valuable insights for AuNPs in realizing diverse regioselective transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via a Heterogenous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

A heterogeneous gallium(III) catalyst drives the sugar transformation reaction by visible light with turnover numbers (TONs) as high as 1500, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) catalyst.







Abstract
Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogeneous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143&#8197;times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON) of the heterogeneous gallium(III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was ca. two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.

         <title>Cationic Bis(hydrosilane)&#8212;Coinage&#8208;Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Use as Catalysts for Outer&#8208;Sphere C=O Hydrosilylation Not Involving Metal Hydrides</title>

Coinage&#8208;metal hydrides or Lewis acidic cationic hydrosilane&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes? The synthesis and characterization of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes are reported. These can catalyze carbonyl hydrosilylation without the addition of an external base. Mechanistic control experiments and DFT calculations reveal a new mechanism in which the coinage&#8208;metal&#8211;alkoxides act as the key intermediates.







Abstract
The preparation of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes by chloride abstraction from the neutral metal chloride precursors with Na[BArF4] is described. Unlike previously reported hydrosilane&#8208;stabilized copper and silver complexes, the presented complexes are cationic and feature two bidentate (ortho&#8208;silylphenyl)phosphine ligands. These complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, revealing that both Si&#8722;H bonds are activated by the Lewis acidic cationic metal center. The new complexes were found to be effective in catalytic carbonyl hydrosilylation, leading to the corresponding silyl ethers under mild conditions without the addition of an external base. Combined mechanistic control experiments and quantum chemical calculations support an ionic outer&#8208;sphere mechanism, in which a neutral metal alkoxide species instead of a metal hydride is the key intermediate that interacts with the silylcarboxonium ion to generate the silyl ether.

         <dc:description>
A series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams are presented. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners.







Abstract
Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy is developed for firmly growing a variety of transition metal&#8208;coordinated polymer catalysts on diverse substrates. An exemplified NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) with Ni/Fe&#8722;N4 coordination structure transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution, which exhibits remarkable activity and stability in alkaline seawater due to the electronic structure modulation, metal anchoring effect and strong substrate adhesion.







Abstract
Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP=polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000&#8197;h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

A highly efficient and tunable ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2O is presented, where the plasma activates inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species reacting with the confined H2O molecules in porous MOF reactors with various compositions and structures.







Abstract
While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8722;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye&#8208;Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp; Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer film with unique multiple chirality inversion properties has been efficiently prepared, based on a newly&#8208;designed pH&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, etc) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record five switchable chiral states and good reversibility.







Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, etc. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newly&#8208;designed acid &amp; base&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, etc.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three&#8208;state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technology, but also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Regulation Achieving Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in Rare&#8208;Earth Hybrid Double Perovskites for Ferroelectrics and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

F&#8208;substitution achieves out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and multipolar axis multiferroicity and enhances the Tc 94&#8197;K in rare&#8208;earth hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric with CPL response. It reveals that F&#8208;substitution is a powerful approach to controlling the performances of ferroic materials and providing new prospects for applications in next&#8208;generation ferroelectric micro&#8208;nano devices.







Abstract
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is a highly desired property of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for application in vertical sandwich&#8208;type photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite great advances that have been made in recent years, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization remains unrealized in the 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric family. Here, from our previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite HQERN ((S3HQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3HQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F&#8208;substitution on organic component to successfully obtain FQERN ((S3FQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3FQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoroquinuclidinium) showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis ferroelectric HQERN, FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity but also realizes out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 94&#8197;K. This is mainly due to the introduction of F&#8208;substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy. Our study demonstrates that F&#8208;substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving more possibility of 2D ferroelectric materials for applications in micro&#8208;nano optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;F-substitution achieves out-of-plane and multipolar axis multiferroicity and enhances the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; 94&#8197;K in rare-earth hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric with CPL response. It reveals that F-substitution is a powerful approach to controlling the performances of ferroic materials and providing new prospects for applications in next-generation ferroelectric micro-nano devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-plane polarization is a highly desired property of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for application in vertical sandwich-type photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite great advances that have been made in recent years, out-of-plane polarization remains unrealized in the 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric family. Here, from our previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite HQERN ((S3HQ)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;EuRb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, S3HQ=S-3-hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F-substitution on organic component to successfully obtain FQERN ((S3FQ)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;EuRb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, S3FQ=S-3-fluoroquinuclidinium) showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis ferroelectric HQERN, FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity but also realizes out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization and a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 94&#8197;K. This is mainly due to the introduction of F-substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy. Our study demonstrates that F-substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving more possibility of 2D ferroelectric materials for applications in micro-nano optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Hindrance Engineering to Modulate the Closed Pores Formation of Polymer&#8208;Derived Hard Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance strategy has been proposed to modulate the closed pores formation of polymer&#8208;derived hard carbon (HC). Sterically hindered groups with aromatic ring are crucial to enhance the rigidity and internal free volumes of polymer, which could suppress the polymer rearrangements and induce the formation of close pores. Moreover, the fabricated HC anode exhibit excellent Na+ storage capacity and fast Na+ transport for sodium&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
The closed pores play a critical role in improving the sodium storage capacity of hard carbon (HC) anode, however, their formation mechanism as well as the efficient modulation strategy at molecular level in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs is still lacking. In this work, the steric hindrance effect has been proposed to create closed pores in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs for the first time through grafting the aromatic rings within and between the main chains in the precursor. The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric&#8208;hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;C, improved rate performance (210.7&#8197;mAh/g at 5&#8197;C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;derived HC anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Rechargeable &#8220;Rocking Chair&#8221; Type Zn&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type aqueous Zn&#8722;CO2 battery was designed with Zn2+ cations shuttling between the cathode and anode in a single compartment. A weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (ZnOTf)2 aqueous electrolyte was introduced to inhibit interfacial side reactions on the Zn anode and facilitate uniform Zn plating. Experimental results confirm a novel reaction pathway of the reversible formation and decomposition for ZnCO3 and carbon discharge products.







Abstract
Rising global temperatures and critical energy shortages have spurred researches into CO2 fixation and conversion within the realm of energy storage such as Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. However, traditional Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries employ double&#8208;compartment electrolytic cells with separate carriers for catholytes and anolytes, diverging from the &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; battery mechanism. The specific energy of these conventional batteries is constrained by the solubility of discharge reactants/products in the electrolyte. Additionally, H2O molecules tend to trigger parasitic reactions at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, undermining the long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes. In this report, we introduce an innovative &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type Zn&#8722;CO2 battery that utilizes a weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate aqueous electrolyte compatible with both cathode and anode. This design minimizes side reactions on the Zn surface and leverages the high catalytic activity of the cathode material, allowing the battery to achieve a substantial discharge capacity of 6734&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain performance over 65&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the successful production of pouch cells demonstrates the practical applicability of Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. Electrode characterizations confirm superior electrochemical reversibility, facilitated by solid discharge products of ZnCO3 and C. This work advances a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with an enhanced specific energy and a reversible pathway, providing a foundation for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Atomic Level&#8208;Macroscopic Structure&#8208;Activity of Inhomogeneous Localized Aggregates Enabled Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hybrid Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micelle&#8208;like structure electrolyte in macroscopic activity is proposed, featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates. Enabled by low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions, this electrolyte offers exceptional solubility, wide electrochemical window, low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) zinc ion conductivity in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt&#8208;water&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic&#8208;level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes. This highlights a distinct category of micelle&#8208;like structure electrolytes featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates, enabled by appropriate low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions. Remarkably, the electrolyte enables exceptional high solubility, accommodating up to 29.8&#8197;m zinc triflate within aqueous micelles. This configuration maintains an intra&#8208;micellar salt&#8208;in&#8208;water setup, allowing for a broad electrochemical window (up to 3.86&#8197;V), low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultralow&#8208;temperature zinc ion conductivity (1.58&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Building upon the unique nature of the inhomogeneous localized aggregates, this micelle&#8208;like electrolyte facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping, even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled Zn||PANI battery showcases an impressive capacity of 71.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an extended lifespan of over 3000 cycles at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. This study opens up a promising approach in electrolyte design that transcends conventional local atomic solvation structures, broadening the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte concept.

Crystalline supramolecular polymer frameworks (SPFs) with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are readily prepared using three&#8208;arm rigid polyisocyanides as building block via intermolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1&#8197;nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) was developed as a functional polymer coating for Zn, enhancing the cycling stability of the Zn anode and accelerating the storage rate of photogenerated charges. This enabled the fabricated photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries to achieve a high overall conversion efficiency of 13.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes the ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300&#8197;h, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12&#8201;% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.

         <title>Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings Engineered via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic network interfacial strategy is developed to form crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on diverse particle and planar substrates. This strategy allows for customized physicochemical properties (e.g., thickness, and morphology) of the supported crystalline MOFs, with potential for biomedical, agricultural, and energy applications.







Abstract
Crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered extensive attention owing to their highly ordered porous structure and physicochemical properties. However, their practical application often requires their integration with various substrates, which is challenging because of their weakly adhesive nature and the diversity of substrates that exhibit different properties. Herein, we report the use of amorphous metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings to facilitate the growth of crystalline MOF coatings on various particle and planar substrates. Crystalline MOFs with different metal ions and morphologies were successfully deposited on substrates (13 types) of varying sizes, shapes, and surface chemistries. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the coated crystalline MOFs (e.g., composition, thickness) could be tuned using different synthesis conditions. The engineered MOF&#8208;coated membranes demonstrated excellent liquid and gas separation performance, exhibiting a high H2 permeance of 63200&#8197;GPU and a H2/CH4 selectivity of 10.19, likely attributable to the thin nature of the coating (~180&#8197;nm). Considering the vast array of MOFs available (&gt;90,000) and the diversity of substrates, this work is expected to pave the way for creating a wide range of MOF composites and coatings with potential applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Formal High&#8208;Order Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, enabling the efficient generation of gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates.







Abstract
The design of various cycloaddition/annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges in the development of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropane chemistry. In this work, a new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic complexes or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates starting from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, while other Lewis acids are ineffective and non&#8208;selective. New examples of formal [6+2]&#8208;, [6+3]&#8208;, [6+4]&#8208;, [6+1]&#8208;, and [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself can also successfully act as a hydride anion donor, which allows the ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered carbocycles has been developed.

         <title>Tailoring Catalysis of Encapsulated Platinum Nanoparticles by Pore Wall Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pt nanoparticles are incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with engineered thioether groups on the pore walls, enabling tailored Pt electronic states and accessible Pt sites. Significantly, the optimized Pt@COF&#8208;S0.5 with electron&#8208;deficient Pt NPs in ~1&#8197;nm sizes and high accessible Pt sites exhibit excellent activity and almost absolute selectivity to targeted p&#8208;chloroaniline in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene.







Abstract
While supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) have shown significant promise in heterogeneous catalysis, precise control over their interaction with the support, which profoundly impacts their catalytic performance, remains a significant challenge. In this study, Pt NPs are incorporated into thioether&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (denoted COF&#8208;Sx), enabling precise control over the size and electronic state of Pt NPs by adjusting the thioether density dangling on the COF pore walls. Notably, the resulting Pt@COF&#8208;Sx demonstrate exceptional selectivity (&gt; 99&#8201;%) in catalytic hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene to p&#8208;chloroaniline, in sharp contrast to the poor selectivity of Pt NPs embedded in thioether&#8208;free COFs. Furthermore, the conversion over Pt@COF&#8208;Sx exhibits a volcano&#8208;type curve as the thioether density increases, due to the corresponding change of accessible Pt sites.

&lt;p&gt;The Pt nanoparticles are incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with engineered thioether groups on the pore walls, enabling tailored Pt electronic states and accessible Pt sites. Significantly, the optimized Pt@COF-S&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; with electron-deficient Pt NPs in ~1&#8197;nm sizes and high accessible Pt sites exhibit excellent activity and almost absolute selectivity to targeted &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloroaniline in the hydrogenation of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloronitrobenzene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) have shown significant promise in heterogeneous catalysis, precise control over their interaction with the support, which profoundly impacts their catalytic performance, remains a significant challenge. In this study, Pt NPs are incorporated into thioether-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (denoted COF-S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), enabling precise control over the size and electronic state of Pt NPs by adjusting the thioether density dangling on the COF pore walls. Notably, the resulting Pt@COF-S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate exceptional selectivity (&amp;gt; 99&#8201;%) in catalytic hydrogenation of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloronitrobenzene to &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-chloroaniline, in sharp contrast to the poor selectivity of Pt NPs embedded in thioether-free COFs. Furthermore, the conversion over Pt@COF-S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a volcano-type curve as the thioether density increases, due to the corresponding change of accessible Pt sites. This work provides an effective approach to regulating the catalysis of metal NPs via their microenvironment modulation, with the aid of rational design and precise tailoring of support structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Group&#8208;Driven Competing Mechanism in Electrochemical Reaction and Adsorption/Desorption Processes toward High&#8208;Capacity Aluminum&#8208;Porphyrin Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Porphyrin derivatives introduced by electron&#8208;donating groups (EDG) and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) present the effect of functional groups on varying the electronic structure of porphyrin derivatives, which changes the redox potential and electrochemical energy storage performance. EWG can increase redox potential, while EDG reduces the redox potential. Due to the increasing electron density, EDG can improve Faradaic electrochemical reaction and de/adsorption capacitance contribution of porphyrin macrocycle, which is beneficial to improve the energy storage.







Abstract
Nonaqueous organic aluminum batteries are considered as promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices due to stable ionic liquid electrolytes and Al metals. However, the stability and capacity of organic positive electrodes are limited by their inherent high solubility and low active organic molecules. To address such issues, here porphyrin compounds with rigid molecular structures present stable and reversible capability in electrochemically storing AlCl2+. Comparison between the porphyrin molecules with electron&#8208;donating groups (TPP&#8208;EDG) and with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (TPP&#8208;EWG) suggests that EDG is responsible for increasing both highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, resulting in decreased redox potentials. On the other hand, EWG is associated with decreasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to promoted redox potentials. EDG and EWG play critical roles in regulating electron density of porphyrin &#960; bond and electrochemical energy storage kinetics behavior. The competitive mechanism between electrochemical redox reaction and de/adsorption processes suggests that TPP&#8208;OCH3 delivers the highest specific capacity ~171.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, approaching a record in the organic Al batteries.

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photochromic molecule that consists of HABI and terarylene exhibits the sequential four&#8208;state photochromism. The delocalization of a &#960;&#8208;electron spin on the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system of the terarylene unit is crucially efficient in increasing the photosensitivity to NIR&#8208;II light. A recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer.







Abstract
A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8722;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading to two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;&#8208;radical on the closed&#8208;ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8722;I and &#8208;II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.

The Fe&#8722;O4 motif embedded carbon material catalyzes oxygen reduction reaction via two electron pathway (2e ORR) to achieve a record&#8208;high H2O2 production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte with exceptional selectivity at a high current density, thanks to the carbon reaction sites activated by the well&#8208;defined Fe&#8722;O4 motif via oxo&#8208;bridges and the highly graphitized carbon substrate.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based materials have been utilized as effective catalysts for hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR), however the insufficient selectivity and productivity still hindered the further industrial applications. In this work, we report the Fe&#8722;O4 motif activated graphitic carbon material which enabled highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis operating at high current density with excellent anti&#8208;poisoning property. In the bulk production test, the concentration of H2O2 cumulated to 8.6&#8201;% in 24&#8197;h and the corresponding production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 outperformed all previously reported materials. Theoretical model backed by in situ characterization verified &#945;&#8208;C surrounding the Fe&#8722;O4 motif as the actual reaction site in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics aspects. The strategy of activating carbon reaction site by metal center via oxo&#8208;bridge provides inspiring insights for the rational design of carbon materials for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy has been used to affect a simple cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated supramolecular heterodimerisation. A further photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition leads to the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane.







Abstract
In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation based on an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Furthermore, the heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system that not only contributes to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriches synthetic methods for mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved tunable reaction pathways for CO2 electroreduction by adjusting the cations in the electrochemical double layer. The main product could be switched from CO (Faradaic efficiency of 97.3&#8201;%) to formate (Faradaic efficiency of 93.5&#8201;%) by simply changing the alkali metal cations in the ternary ionic liquid&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO=97.3&#8201;%) to formate (FEformate=93.5&#8201;%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1&#8197;M KBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1&#8197;M CsBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.

         <title>Variation of Chemical Microenvironment of Pores in Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain engineering approach is proposed to elucidate the impact of pore chemical microenvironment variation on photocatalytic H2O2 production behavior of two hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Comparatively, COF&#8722;O features impeded charge recombination, lowered charge transfer resistance, accelerated interfacial electron transfer and additional reactive sites, leading to an impressive apparent quantum yield of 10.3&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is an advantageous and ecologically sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving high conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents remains a challenge. In this study, two covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;O and COF&#8722;C) were prepared with identical skeletal structures but with their pore walls anchored to different alkyl chains. They were used to investigate the effect of the chemical microenvironment of pores on photocatalytic H2O2 production. Experimental results reveal a change of hydrophilicity in COF&#8722;O, leading to suppressed charge recombination, diminished charge transfer resistance, and accelerated interfacial electron transfer. An apparent quantum yield as high as 10.3&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) can be achieved with H2O and O2 through oxygen reduction reaction. This is among the highest ever reported for polymer photocatalysts. This study may provide a novel avenue for optimizing photocatalytic activity and selectivity in H2O2 generation.

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500&#8197;Wh/kg</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

[Fe(CN)6] vacancies regulation is proposed to achieve high specific capacity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). And then a novel precipitation conversion synthesis method was designed. The as&#8208;prepared PBAs with hierarchical hollow morphology and [Fe(CN)6] vacancies have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh energy density.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover upon Methane Dissociation on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under real&#8208;world conditions, the frequent collisions of gaseous CH4 molecules on Rh/Cu(111) single&#8208;atom alloy are a key to promote adsorbate spillover, especially for bulky polyatomic CH3* species, providing insights into the effective use of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has a minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by the frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Nitrate Upcycling Mediated by Organonickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed nitrate (NO3&#8722;) upcycling technology has been developed that uses a nickel pincer complex as a bifunctional catalyst to effect sequential deoxygenation followed by C&#8722;N coupling. This approach enables nitrate salts to be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%).







Abstract
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major environmental pollutants and to neutralize this long&#8208;term environmental threat, new catalytic methods are needed. Although there are biological denitrification processes involving four different enzymatic reactions to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into dinitrogen (N2), it is unfortunately difficult to apply in industry due to the complexity of the processes. In particular, nitrate is difficult to functionalize because of its chemical stability. Thus, there is no organometallic catalysis to convert nitrate into useful chemicals. Herein, we present a nickel pincer complex that is effective as a bifunctional catalyst to stepwise deoxygenate NO3&#8722; by carbonylation and further through C&#8722;N coupling. By using this nickel catalysis, nitrate salts can be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the highly inert nitrate ion can be functionalized to produce useful chemicals by a new organonickel catalysis. Our results show that the NOx conversion and utilization (NCU) technology is a successful pathway for environmental restoration coupled with value&#8208;added chemical generation.

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Imaging/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z1 was synthesized and it was encapsulated with F127 polymer to obtain Z1 NPs. They could generate ROS effectively under 808&#8197;nm laser, particularly type I ROS. Moreover, they exhibited good mitochondrial targeting, and induced synergistic pyroptosis and apoptosis for potent tumor therapy. Meanwhile, Z1 NPs demonstrated NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy with minimal adverse effects.







Abstract
Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the use of a boryl group as a traceless directing group in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynes. The approach allows highly selective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis of a Metalla[2]catenane, Metallarectangles and Polynuclear Assemblies from Di(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands</title>

The fluorenone&#8208;bridged di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to give the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4, which disintegrates in DMF into two metallarectangles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. Substitution of the imidazo[1,5a]pyridinium NHC precursors in H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 for imidazolium groups yields di&#8208;NHC precursors H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 which react with Ag2O to yield exclusively metallarectangles of type [Ag2(L)2(PF6)2 with a spacing between the fluorenone planes too small for [2]catenane formation.







Abstract
The 2,7&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;linked bis(6&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4. The [2]catenane rearranges in DMF to yield two metallamacrocycles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. 2,7&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;(imidazolium) salts H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 (L=2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b) react with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield metallamacrocycles [Ag2(L)2](PF6)2 with interplanar distances between the fluorenone rings too small for [2]catenane formation. Intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the fluorenone groups were observed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The strongly kinked 2,7&#8208;fluorenone bridged bis(5&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to yield [Ag2(4)(CN)](PF6), while the tetranuclear assembly [Ag4(4)2(CO3)](PF6)2 was obtained in the presence of K2CO3.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14, were incorporated with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyl chains to induce intrinsic polarizability and piezoelectric properties. Utilizing these two COFs to assemble piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), remarkable output open circuit voltage, short circuit current and stability were produced under the applied force without poling conditions.







Abstract
Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor&#8208;directed strategy is developed to construct unconventional Ni heteronanocrystals with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating asymmetric surfaces with plenty of convex sites. Such unique convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy while stabilizing interfacial *H2O, synergistically facilitating alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mgNi&#8722;1 (6.3&#8197;times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.

         <title>Anionic Chemistry Modulation Enabled Environmental Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc Batteries: The Case of Carbonate Ions</title>

         <dc:description>
A methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes is presented, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property.







Abstract
Anionic chemistry modulation represents a promising avenue to enhance the electrochemical performance and unlock versatile applications in cutting&#8208;edge energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property. The elaborately designed batteries with an air&#8208;switch demonstrate rapid self&#8208;recharging capabilities, recovering over 80&#8201;% of the electrochemical full charging capacity within a remarkably short timeframe of 1&#8197;hour and achieving a cumulative self&#8208;charging capacity of 5&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1. The aqueous self&#8208;charging battery strategy induced by carbonate anion, as proposed in this study, holds the potential for extending to various anionic systems, including seawater&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion batteries. This work offers a universal framework for advancing next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;functional power sources.

         <dc:description>
The forest , a valuable source for the development of sustainable photosensitizers, essentially improves the technological potential of photo&#8208;ATRP and free radical polymerization. In their Research Article (e202402915), Shujun Li, Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. demonstrate the performance of a new material, produced by confinement of cellulose&#8208;based carbon dots, that operates as a long afterglow emitter in the second timeframe and as photocatalyst in radical photopolymerization. Their use in a photo&#8208;ATRP cocktail results in block copolymers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The forest&lt;/b&gt; , a valuable source for the development of sustainable photosensitizers, essentially improves the technological potential of photo-ATRP and free radical polymerization. In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202402915"&gt;(e202402915)&lt;/a&gt;, Shujun Li, Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. demonstrate the performance of a new material, produced by confinement of cellulose-based carbon dots, that operates as a long afterglow emitter in the second timeframe and as photocatalyst in radical photopolymerization. Their use in a photo-ATRP cocktail results in block copolymers.

Supramolecular hetero&#8208;self&#8208;assembly is more challenging and meaningful compared to homo&#8208;self&#8208;assembly in many areas. In their Research Article (e202410130), Xu&#8208;Man Chen, Hong Yang, Quan Li et&#8197;al. present a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerization, which enables the occurrence of a rare cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated [2+2] heterocycloaddition under UV irradiation. The final product is found to be an unexpected [2]rotaxane, developing into a novel photochemical template synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <dc:description>
A synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method was developed to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. To mimic the lipid environment in synapses, model vesicles and a modified lipid layer were confined within a nanopipette, as reported by Ru&#8208;Jia Yu, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202406677). Characteristic ionic current oscillations were recorded and could be used to evaluate the binding affinity of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles.

         <title>Exploring Nanozymes for Organic Substrates: Building Nano&#8208;organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

This paper provides a comprehensively review of nanozymes targeting organic substrates, discusses the strategies for efficient identification of new nanozymes, and proposes a novel paradigm for constructing nano&#8208;organelles.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the first peroxidase nanozyme (Fe3O4), numerous nanomaterials have been reported to exhibit intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity toward inorganic oxygen species, such as H2O2, oxygen, and O2&#8722;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward&#8208;looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano&#8208;organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano&#8208;organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides a comprehensively review of nanozymes targeting organic substrates, discusses the strategies for efficient identification of new nanozymes, and proposes a novel paradigm for constructing nano-organelles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of the first peroxidase nanozyme (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), numerous nanomaterials have been reported to exhibit intrinsic enzyme-like activity toward inorganic oxygen species, such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, oxygen, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure-activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward-looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano-organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano-organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupled Electron&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Transfer Processes at a Liquid/Liquid Interface Decorated with Photoactive Nanomaterials</title>

The electron transfer and ion transfer reactions at self&#8208;assembled BiVO4 particles at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface could be disentangled by the combined use of micropipettes and microelectrodes to detect the products. The rates of all processes could be modulated by an external Galvani potential difference across the liquid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO4 particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid&#8208;liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2&#8208;dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO4 under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference

         <title>Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. Characteristic ionic current oscillations have been used to evaluate the binding affinity, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles. This finding sheds light on the mechanism of vesicle&#8208;mediated tau spreading and tau pathology.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau participates in neurotransmission regulation via its interaction with synaptic vesicles (SVs). The precise nature and mechanics of tau&#8216;s engagement with SVs, especially regarding alterations in vesicle dynamics, remain a matter of discussion. We report an electrochemical method using a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette to monitor vesicle dynamics induced by tau. A model vesicle of ~30&#8197;nm is confined within a lipid&#8208;modified nanopipette orifice with a comparable diameter to mimic the synaptic lipid environment. Both tau and phosphorylated tau (p&#8208;tau) present two&#8208;state dynamic behavior in this biomimetic system, showing typical ionic current oscillation, induced by lipid&#8208;tau interaction. The results indicate that p&#8208;tau has a stronger affinity to the lipid vesicles in the confined environment, blocking the vesicle movement to a higher degree. Taken together, this method bridges a gap for sensing synaptic vesicle dynamics in a confined lipid environment, mimicking vesicle movement near the synaptic membrane. These findings contribute to understanding how different types of tau protein regulate synaptic vesicle motility and to underlying its functional and pathological behaviours in disease.

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with a semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic sensing of chloride anions has been developed by employing a semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter inside the &#946; barrel of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin pore. When the chloride receptor blocks the protein pore, it inhibits the ionic current through the pore, providing a single&#8208;molecule sensing technology and concomitantly allowing detection of its chloride guest. The kinetic parameters are deduced from the single&#8208;channel recordings in the absence and presence of chloride anions.







Abstract
Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.

The one&#8208;step synthesis of tetra&#8208;substituted benzenes was accomplished via gold&#8208;catalyzed diyne&#8208;ene annulation. Distinguished from prior modification methods, this novel strategy undergoes formal [3+3] cyclization, producing polysubstituted benzenes with exceptional efficiency. Amides are reported for the first time in gold catalysis as covalent nucleophilic co&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step synthesis of tetra&#8208;substituted benzenes was accomplished via gold&#8208;catalyzed diyne&#8208;ene annulation. Distinguished from prior modification methods, this novel strategy undergoes formal [3+3] cyclization, producing polysubstituted benzenes with exceptional efficiency. The critical factor enabling this transformation was the introduction of amides, which were reported for the first time in gold catalysis as covalent nucleophilic co&#8208;catalysts. This interesting protocol not only offers a new strategy to achieve functional benzenes with high efficiency, but also enlightens potential new reaction pathways within gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne activation processes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadienes by Birch Reduction in the Presence of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete change in regioselectivity has been observed during the Birch reduction of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds. Alkyl aldehydes afford exclusively 1,4&#8208;isomers, whereas with ketones and aryl aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are isolated in good yields on a large scale. Such compounds are suitable precursors for further transformations.







Abstract
Birch reductions are well&#8208;known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;&#8208;position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;&#8208;position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, m&#8208; and p&#8208;toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93&#8201;% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4&#8201;:&#8201;1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only trans isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal meta selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a subsequent cyclization/oxidation process to access inherently chiral calix[4]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Both the large&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic transformation of calix[4]arene&#8208;based chiral catalysts have demonstrated their potential applications.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes are an excellent structural scaffold for enantioselective synthesis, chiral recognition, sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives via cascade enantioselective cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component reaction features a broad substrate scope (33&#8197;examples), high efficiency (up to 90&#8201;% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee on average). The potential applications of calix[4]arene derivatives are highlighted by their synthetic transformation and a detailed investigation of their photophysical and chiroptical properties.

         <title>Exploiting trans&#8208;Sulfinylation for the Synthesis of Diverse N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfinamides via Decarboxylative Sulfinamidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trans&#8208;sulfinylation enables the generation of hydrolytically&#8208;sensitive alkyl sulfinylamines in situ from Tr&#8208;NSO and primary amines. We exploit this process alongside alkyl radical generation from carboxylic acids using acridine photocatalysis to prepare a broad selection of N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides from structurally diverse and readily available feedstocks.







Abstract
Combining simple amines with the bench&#8208;stable sulfinylamine Tr&#8208;NSO allows in situ preparation of reactive alkyl sulfinylamines, which when combined with alkyl radicals generated by photocatalytic decarboxylation, provides N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides. The reactions are broad in scope and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups on both the acid and amine components. The sulfinamide products are used to prepare a selection of challenging S(VI) products. The method provides a convenient way to use reactive and unstable alkyl sulfinylamines.

         <title>Deuteration as a General Strategy to Enhance Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotope effects have been explored for decades and now find entrance into photopharmacology. Simple deuteration of azobenzene photoswitches improves photoswitching quantum yield and macroscopic switching kinetics. This finding is translated to the faster optical control of big potassium ion channels and G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, important players for synaptic transmission and neural communication.







Abstract
Chemical photoswitches have become a widely used approach for the remote control of biological functions with spatiotemporal precision. Several molecular scaffolds have been implemented to improve photoswitch characteristics, ranging from the nature of the photoswitch itself (e.g. azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, hemithioindigo) to fine&#8208;tuning of aromatic units and substituents. Herein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing the performance of photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity (higher molar extinction coefficient), photoswitch efficiency (higher photoisomerization quantum yield), and photoswitch kinetics (faster macroscopic rate of photoisomerization) with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene&#8208;based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes can be accomplished by a strategy involving alkene diboration followed by site&#8208;selective activation and copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of the less&#8208;hindered boronic ester. This process allows a broad array of difunctional chiral products to be produced from simple olefin starting materials.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed regioselective activation of bis(boronic esters), followed by functionalization, is reported. A bulky activator is shown to selectively activate the less hindered boronic ester enabling it to undergo stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling to a variety of electrophiles. This steric&#8208;based regioselectivity provides a simple and efficient method to prepare highly functionalized, enantiomerically enriched products starting from simple alkenes.

         <title>Direct Benzylic C&#8722;H Etherification Enabled by Base&#8208;Promoted Halogen Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;promoted halogen transfer enables direct benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reactions with alcohols. This new deprotonative C&#8722;H oxidation protocol displays unique synthetic capabilities over alternative mechanistic strategies, including the ability to activate high oxidation potential substrates, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, and precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes.







Abstract
We disclose a benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based methods for C&#8722;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8722;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8722;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecular Bromine Production in Sea&#8208;Salt Aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O without additional potent oxidants is proposed. Under acidic conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ can spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Light can promote this process significantly and promote the release of molecular bromine into the gas phase.







Abstract
Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8722; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate was up to 1.55&#215;1010&#8201;molecules&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8722; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8722; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production; here, H3O+ facilitates the activation of Br&#8722; by O2, serves as a significant source of atmospheric reactive bromine and exerts a profound impact on the atmospheric oxidation capacity.

         <title>Photochemically Driven Peptide Formation in Supersaturated Aerosol Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of amide bonds between amino acids in supersaturated aerosol droplets is shown to be possible in the presence of dicyandiamide, a potential prebiotic compound, and intense visible light. The rate of this photochemical reaction is strongly dependent on the microdroplet radius.







Abstract
The condensation of amino acids into peptides plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and is thus essential for understanding the origins of life. However, the spontaneous formation of peptides from amino acids in bulk aqueous media is energetically unfavorable, posing a challenge for elucidating plausible abiotic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the formation of amide bonds between amino acids within highly supersaturated aerosol droplets containing dicyandiamide (DCD), a cyanide derivative potentially present on primordial Earth. Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron&#8208;sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra. The reaction rate is found to be strongly influenced by droplet size and kinetic modelling suggests that it is driven by the photochemical product of a DCD self&#8208;reaction. Our results highlight the potential of atmospheric aerosol particles as reaction environments for peptide synthesis and have potential implications for the prebiotic chemistry of early Earth.

A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups.

A seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium has been developed as the key core skeleton for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The low&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring lead to a stabilization of the LUMO via a &#8220;px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation&#8221;. The observed intense emission with a large Stokes shift was attributed to a large structural relaxation with a contribution from a quinoidal resonance structure in the excited state.







Abstract
Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring compounds have been reported, the seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium have not been fully studied yet. In this study, dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. These compounds exhibit fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of ca. 70&#8197;nm compared to a phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. A theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Due to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared to that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring permits effective px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with a contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which should be responsible for the bright emission with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>BioLindlar Catalyst: Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Promoted Selective Bioreduction of Cyanoalkynes to Give (Z)&#8208;Cyanoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes are attractive starting materials owing to the wide range of possible chemical transformations of this functional group. The selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;poor alkynes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases to give (Z)&#8208; or (E)&#8208;alkenes is now reported. Preparative biotransformations were performed with total selectivity to give the (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes (isolated in 63&#8211;97&#8201;%&#8201;yield), thus resembling the activity shown by transition&#8208;metal (e.g. Lindlar) catalysts.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Unfortunately, efficient biocatalytic alternatives for this transformation have yet to be discovered. Herein, the selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to alkenes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) is described. Alkynes bearing ketone, aldehyde, ester, and nitrile moieties have been effectively reduced with excellent conversions and stereoselectivities, observing clear trends for the E/Z ratios depending on the nature of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group. In the case of cyanoalkynes, (Z)&#8208;alkenes were obtained as the major product, and the reaction scope was expanded to a wide variety of aromatic substrates (up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion, and Z/E stereoselectivities of up to &gt;99/1). Other alkynes containing aldehyde, ketone, or ester functionalities also proved to be excellent substrates, and interestingly gave the corresponding (E)&#8208;alkenes. Preparative biotransformations were performed on a 0.4&#8197;mmol scale, producing the desired (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes with good to excellent isolated yields (63&#8211;97&#8201;%). This novel reactivity has been rationalised through molecular docking by predicting the binding poses of key molecules in the ERED&#8208;pu&#8208;0006 active site.

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8722;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
An organophosphorus&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles using inorganic sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.







Abstract
An organophosphorus &#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8722; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.

         <title>Effective Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with an Iron&#8208;Xantphos Catalyst: Mechanistic and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings have been widely studied and developed in the last decade, alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling systems with iron remain underdeveloped despite the importance of C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds in organic synthesis. A major challenge to the development of these reactions is the current lack of fundamental insight into ligand effects and organoiron intermediates that enable effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl couplings. The current study addresses this longstanding limitation using a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and reactivity studies of alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling with iron&#8208;Xantphos to define the in situ formed iron&#8208;Xantphos intermediates in catalysis. Combined with detailed reactivity studies, the nature of the key mechanistic pathways in catalysis and ligands effects to achieve effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling over competing b&#8208;H elimination pathways are probed. Overall, these foundational studies provide a platform for future bespoke ligand and pre&#8208;catalyst design for alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling methods development with sustainable iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Graded Redox Interfacial Modifier for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a potential competitor to the silicon photovoltaic technology. The most representative perovskite cells employ SnO2 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as the charge&#8208;transport materials. Despite their high efficiencies, perovskite cells with such a configuration show unsatisfactory lifespan, normally attributed to the instability of perovskites and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Limited attention was paid to the influence of SnO2, an inorganic material, on device stability. Here we show that improving SnO2 with a redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, simultaneously enhances the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Redox reactions between the bivalent cobalt complexes and oxygen lead to the formation of a graded distribution of trivalent and bivalent cobalt complexes across the surface and bulk regions of the SnO2. The trivalent cobalt complex at the top surface of SnO2 raises the concentration of (SO3NH2)&#8208; which passivates uncoordinated Pb2+ and relieves tensile stress, facilitating the formation of perovskite with improved crystallinity. Our approach enables perovskite cells with PCEs of up to 24.91%. The devices retained 93.8% of their initial PCEs after 1000 hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking. These findings showcase the potential of cobalt complexes as redox interfacial modifiers for high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement of Vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) to Synthesize Six&#8208;Membered Non&#8208;Conjugated Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) under mild conditions to synthesize non&#8208;conjugated cyclohexenone derivatives, which so far do not have many ways to be accessed. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope with reaction yields up to 98%. This VCBO rearrangement can also be used to access various n/6 (n = 5&#8208;8) bicyclic products efficiently. Furthermore, mechanism of this rearrangement has been investigated using DFT calculations, showing that vinyl group&#8208;assisted cyclobutanone C&#8208;C cleavage is easy with a computed activation free energy of 18.1 kcal/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>Interdependence of Support Wettability &#8208;Electrodeposition Rate &#8208; Sodium Metal&#160;Anode and SEI Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study examines how current collector support chemistry (sodiophilic intermetallic Na2Te vs. sodiophobic baseline Cu) and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Capacity and current (6 mAh cm&#8208;2, 0.5&#8208;3 mA cm&#8208;2) representative of commercially relevant mass loading in anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AF&#8208;SMBs) are analyzed. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) are combined with cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) microscopy. Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te&#8208;Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modelling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stable Radical Anion and Energy Storage Performance of Pentacene Tetraimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imide functionalization has been widely proved to be an effective approach to enrich optoelectronic properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, appending multiple imide groups onto linear acenes is still a synthetic challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that by taking advantage of a &#8220;breaking and mending&#8221; strategy, a linear pentacene tetraimides (PeTI) was synthesized through a three&#8208;step sequence started from the naphthalene diimides (NDI). Compared with the parent pentacene, PeTI shows a deeper&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, narrower bandgap and better stability. The redox behavior of PeTI was firstly evaluated by generating a stable radical anion specie with the assistance of cobaltocene (CoCp2), and the structure of the electron transfer (ET) complex was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray crystallography. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple redox&#8208;active sites, we are able to show that the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy storage performance of the dealkylated PeTI (designated as PeTCTI) in organic potassium ion batteries (OPIBs) as an anode. Our results shed light on the application of multiple imides functionalized linear acenes, and the reported synthetic strategy provides an effective way to get access to longer nanoribbon imides with fascinating electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strongly Reducing sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Formed by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks linked by carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds (C=C COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline, porous, and conjugated polymeric materials with potential applications in organic electronics, photocatalysis, and energy storage. Despite the rapidly growing interest in sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs, only a small number of closely related condensation reactions have been successfully employed for their synthesis to date. Herein, we report the first example of a C=C COF, CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1 (CORN = Cornell University), prepared by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) dimerization. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional layered structure and hexagonal guest&#8208;accessible pores decorated with a high density of strongly reducing tetraazafulvalene linkages. Exposure of CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1 to tetracyanoethylene (TCNE, E1/2 = 0.13 V and &#8722;0.87 V vs. SCE) oxidizes the COF and encapsulates the radical anion TCNE&#8226;&#8722; and the dianion TCNE2&#8722; as guest molecules, as confirmed by spectroscopic and magnetic analysis. Notably, the reactive TCNE&#8226;&#8722; radical anion, which generally dimerizes in the solid state, is uniquely stabilized within the pores of CORN&#8208;COF&#8208;1. Overall, our findings broaden the toolbox of reactions available for the synthesis of redox&#8208;active C=C COFs, paving the way for the design of novel materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Evidence for the Axial Coordination Effect of Atomic Iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 Sites in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a molecular&#8208;scale investigation of the axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM). A well&#8208;defined model catalytic system with explicit and uniform iodine&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N4 sites was constructed facilely by the self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) on an I&#8208;modified Au(111) surface. The electrocatalytic activity of FePc for the ORR shows a tremendous enhancement with axial iodine ligands. The ingenious modulation of the electronic structure of Fe sites to evoke a higher spin configuration by axial iodine was evidenced. In addition, the interaction strength between reactive oxygen species and active centers becomes weaker due to the presence of iodine ligands, and the reaction is thermodynamically preferable. Moreover, the facilitated reaction dynamics of FePc on I/Au(111) were explicitly determined via in&#8208;situ ECSTM potential pulse experiments. Noteworthily, axial atomic iodine was found inefficacious for improving the activity of Co&#8208;N4 sites, and electron rearrangement was not detected, demonstrating that adequate interactions between axial ligands and metal sites for optimizing electronic structures and catalytic behaviors are prerequisites for the impactful role of axial ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Covalent Inhibiting JNK3 by Small Molecules for Parkinson's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinases (JNKs) including JNK1/2/3 are key members of mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase family. Wherein JNK3 is specifically expressed in brain and emerges as therapeutic target, especially for neurodegenerative diseases. However, developing JNK3 selective inhibitors as chemical probes to investigate its therapeutic potential in diseases remains challenging. Here, we adopted the covalent strategy for identifying JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitorJC16I, with high inhibitory activity against JNK3. Despite targeting a conserved cysteine the vicinity of ATP pocket in JNK family, JC16I exerted a greater than 160&#8208;fold selectivity for JNK3 over JNK1/2. Importantly, even at low concentration, JC16I showed enhanced and long&#8208;lasting inhibition against cellular JNK3. In addition, its alkyne&#8208;containing probe JC&#8208;P1 could label JNK3 in SH&#8208;SY5Y cell lysate and living cells, with goodproteome&#8208;wide selectivity. Furthermore, JC16I selectively suppressed the abnormal activation of JNK3 signaling and sufficiently exhibited neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's diseases (PD) models. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of developing isoform&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active JNK3 inhibitors by covalent drug design strategy targeting a conserved cysteine. This work not only provides a valuable chemical probe for JNK3&#8208;targeted investigations in vitro and in vivo but also opens new avenues for the treatment of PD.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending Shelf&#8208;life of Two&#8208;step Method Precursor Solutions through Targeted Regulation for Highly Efficient and Reproducible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precursor solution aging process can cause significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Notably, we first observe that the aging phenomenon is more severe in the precursor of two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in one&#8208;step method due to that the protic solvent isopropanol facilitates amine&#8208;cation side reaction and iodide ions oxidation. Herein, we report a novel approach for selectively stabilizing both organic amine salt and lead iodide (PbI2) precursor solutions in two&#8208;step method. The introduction of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol into organic amine salt solution can mitigate amine&#8208;cation side reactions due to the formation of an acidic and reducing environment. Simultaneously, decamethylferrocene (FcMe10/FcMe+10) pair can act as a redox shuttle in PbI2 solution to concurrently oxidize Pb0 and reduce I2 in cyclic manner. Consequently, the PVSCs device fabricated from ameliorative precursor solutions demonstrates superior power conversion efficiency of 25.31%, retaining 95% of its efficiency after 21 days of solution aging. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 85% of primitive efficiency for 1500 h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination. This work establishes a fundamental guidance and scientific direction for the stabilization of two&#8208;step perovskite precursor solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene Triggered Free Radical Polymerization in Minutes toward All&#8208;Printed Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive manufacturing of (quasi&#8208;) solid&#8208;state (QSS) electrochemical energy storage devices (EES) highlights the significance of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) design. Creating well&#8208;bonded electrode&#8208;GPEs interfaces in the electrode percolative network via printing leads to large&#8208;scale production of customized EES with boosted electrochemical performance but has proven to be quite challenging. Herein, we report on a versatile, universal and scalable approach to engineer a controllable, seamless electrode&#8208;GPEs interface via free radical polymerization (FRP) triggered by MXene at room temperature. Importantly, MXene reduces the dissociation enthalpy of persulfate initiators and significantly shortens the induction period accelerated by SO&#8722; 4&#183;, enabling the completion of FRP within minutes. The as&#8208;formed well&#8208;bonded electrode&#8208;GPEs interface homogenizes the electrical and concentration fields (i.e., Zn2+), therefore suppressing the dendrites formation, which translates to long&#8208;term cycling (50,000 times), high energy density (105.5 Wh kg&#8722;1) and power density (9231 W kg&#8722;1) coupled with excellent stability upon deformation in the zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZHCs). Moreover, the critical switch of the rheological behaviours of the polymer electrolyte (as aqueous inks in still state and become solids once triggered by MXene) perfectly ensures the direct all&#8208;printing of electrodes and GPEs with well&#8208;bonded interface in between, opening vast possibilities for all&#8208;printed QSS EES beyond ZHCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution Reactivity of Pentagonal Carbon Rings and p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization Effect with Ru</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological defects are inevitable existence in carbon&#8208;based frameworks, but their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and mechanism remain under&#8208;explored. Herein, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of pentagonal carbon&#8208;rings is probed by constructing pentagonal ring&#8208;rich carbon (PRC), with optimized electronic structures and higher HER activity relative to common hexagonal carbon (HC). Furthermore, to improve the reactivity, we couple Ru clusters with PRC (Ru@PRC) through p&#8208;d orbital hybridization between C and Ru atoms, which drives a shortcut transfer of electrons from Ru clusters to pentagonal rings. The electron&#8208;deficient Ru species leads to a notable negative shift in d&#8208;band centers of Ru and weakens their binding strength with hydrogen intermediates, thus enhancing the HER activity in different pH media. Especially, at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, PRC greatly reduces alkaline HER overpotentials from 540 to 380 mV. And Ru@PRC even exhibits low overpotentials of 28 and 275 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Impressively, the mass activity and price activity of Ru@PRC are 7.83 and 15.7 times higher than that of Pt/C at the overpotential of 50 mV. Our data unveil the positive HER reactivity of pentagonal defects and good application prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical "Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; Strategy for Enhancing Gas Adsorption and Separation through Aperture Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;modification of porous materials with molecular modulators has emerged as a well&#8208;established strategy for improving gas adsorption and separation. However, a notable challenge lies in maintaining porosity and the limited applicability of the current method. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical "Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF" strategy, utilizing porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic pores and apertures as surface modulators to improve the gas adsorption and separation properties of the parent MOFs. We demonstrated the fast and facile preparation of 28 distinct MOF@PCC composites by combining 7&#160;MOFs with 4 PCCs with varying aperture sizes and exposed functional groups&#160;through a mechanochemical reaction&#160;in 5 mins. Only the combinations of PCCs and MOFs with closely matched aperture sizes exhibited enhanced gas adsorption and separation performance. Specifically, MOF&#8208;808@PCC&#8208;4 exhibited a significantly increased C2H2 uptake (+64%) and a longer CO2/C2H2 separation retention time (+40%). MIL&#8208;101@PCC&#8208;4 achieved a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity of 6.11 mmol/g. This work not only highlights the broad applicability of the mechanochemical "Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy for the&#160;functionalization of a wide range of MOFs but also establishes potential design principles for the development of hybrid porous materials with enhanced gas adsorption and separation capabilities, along with promising applications in catalysis and intracellular delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rechargeable Urea&#8208;Assisted Zn&#8208;Air Battery with High Energy Efficiency and Fast&#8208;Charging Enabled by Engineering High&#8208;Energy Interfacial Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are highly regarded as promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure features the incorporation of Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface. Strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges in the heterointerface between the &#8208;OH and &#8208;O. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8208;CoOOH@NiOOH, affords an ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33 V at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity exceeding that of initial cobalt oxyhydroxide by over 11.9 times. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieves a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56% at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, remarkable durability (1000 hours at even a current density of 50 mA cm&#8208;2), and quick charge performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Li2ZnCu3 modified Cu current collector to regulate Li deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rationally designing a current collector that can maintain low lithium (Li) porosity and smooth morphology while enduring high&#8208;loading Li deposition is crucial for realizing the high energy density of Li metal batteries, but it is still challengeable. Herein, a Li2ZnCu3 alloy&#8208;modified Cu foil is reported as a stable current collector to fulfill the stable high&#8208;loading Li deposition. Benefiting from the in&#8208;situ alloying, the generated numerous Li2ZnCu3@Cu heterojunctions induce a homogeneous Li nucleation and dense growth even at an ultrahigh capacity of 12 mAh cm&#8208;2. Such a spatial structure endows the overall Li2ZnCu3@Cu electrode with the manipulated steric hindrance and outmost surface electric potential to suppress the side reactions during Li stripping and plating. The resultant Li||Li2ZnCu3@Cu asymmetric cell preserves an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% at 3 mA cm&#8208;2/6 mAh cm&#8208;2 over 200 cycles. Moreover, the Li&#8208;Li2ZnCu3@Cu||LiFePO4 cell maintains a cycling stability of 87.5% after 300 cycles. After coupling with the LiCoO2 cathode (4 mAh cm&#8208;2), the cell exhibits a high energy density of 407.4 Wh kg&#8208;1 with remarkable cycling reversibility at an N/P ratio of 3. All these findings present a doable way to realize the high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free, and dense Li deposition for high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Copper Single&#8208;Atoms&#8208;Stabilized Metastable Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Dichalcogenides for Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconventional 1T&#8242; phase transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, they are susceptible to transitioning into the stable 2H phase, which reduces their catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we present a scalable approach for designing thermally stable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs hollow structures (HSs) by etching Cu1.94S templates from pre&#8208;synthesized Cu1.94S@TMDs heterostructures, including 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 HSs. Furthermore, taking 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 HSs as an example, the etched Cu ions can be firmly adsorbed on their surface in the form of single atoms (SAs) through Cu&#8208;S bonds, thereby elevating the phase transition temperature from 149 &#186;C to 373 &#186;C. Due to the advantages conferred by the 1T&#8242; phase, hollow structure, and synergistic effect between Cu SAs and 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 supports, the fabricated 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 HSs demonstrate superior HER performance. Notably, their high&#8208;phase stability enables continuous operation of designed 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 HSs for up to 200 hours at an ampere&#8208;level current density without significant activity decay. This work provides a universal method for synthesizing highly stable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs electrocatalysts, with a particular focus on the relationship between their phase and catalytic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Blood Cell&#8208;Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Inhibit Influenza Virus through Surface&#8208;Displayed Sialic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disrupting the conserved multivalent binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on influenza A virus (IAV) to sialic acids (SAs) on the host cell membrane offers a robust strategy to block viral attachment and infection, irrespective of antigenic evolution or drug resistance. In this study, we exploit red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) as nanodecoys by harnessing their high abundance of surface&#8208;displayed SAs to interact with IAV through multivalent HA&#8208;SA interactions. This high&#8208;avidity binding inhibits viral adhesion to the cell surface, effectively preventing both attachment and infection in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. Notably, enzymatic removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly diminishes their anti&#8208;IAV efficacy. Our findings indicate that RBC sEVs possess intrinsic anti&#8208;IAV properties due to their native multivalent SAs and hold considerable promise as antiviral therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;natural MUC1 Glycopeptide Homogeneous Cancer Vaccine with Enhanced Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor&#8208;associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non&#8208;selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1&#8208;based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure&#8208;guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non&#8208;natural amino acids and has an &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM197 (Cross&#8208;Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re&#8208;bridging of a disulfide in CRM197, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1&#8208;like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth.

However, their low immunogenicity and non-selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1-based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure-guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non-natural amino acids and has an &#945;-S-glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar N-acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM197 (Cross-Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re-bridging of a disulfide in CRM197, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1-like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor-associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were&#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ostwald&#8208;Ripening Induced Interfacial Protection Layer Boosts 1,000,000&#8208;Cycled Hydronium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collapsing and degradation of active materials caused by the electrode/electrolyte interface instability in aqueous batteries are one of the main obstacles that mitigate the capacity. Herein by reversing the notorious side reactions include the loss and dissolution of electrode materials: as we applied Ostwald ripening (OR) in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in a hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, the dissolved Cu and Fe ions undergo a crystallization process that creates a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface. The layer exposed the low&#8208;index crystal planes (100) and (110) through OR&#8208;induced electrode particle growth, supplemented by vacancy&#8208;ordered (100) superlattices that facilitated ion migration. Our design stabilized the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably, achieving a cycle life of one million cycles with capacity retention of 91.6%, and a capacity retention of 91.7% after 3000 cycles for a full battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Desymmetrization for the Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls Using an Engineered Imine Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic atroposelective synthesis of biaryl compounds is relatively rare, despite considerable attention received by biocatalysis in academic and industrial sectors. Imine reductases (IREDs) are an important class of enzymes that have been applied in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amine building blocks. In this work, two IREDs (IR140 and IR189) were identified to catalyze the efficient desymmetrization of biaryls utilizing various amine donors. Further protein engineering enabled the identification of variants (IR189 M8&#8208;M9 and IR189 M13&#8208;M14) that are able to catalyze the formation of both (R) and (S) atropisomers in excellent yields and atroposelectivities for up to 24 examples (up to 99% ee and yield). The absolute configuration and rotational barriers were confirmed, and the reactions were readily enlarged to allow isolation of the atropisomeric products in 99% ee and 82% isolated yields. The optically pure biaryl amines were further derivatized into various synthetically useful atropisomers. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed, offering plausible explanations for the improved atroposelectivities and enzymatic activities. The current strategy expands the scope of IRED&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral biaryl amines, contributing significantly to the field of atroposelective biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Water Dissociation and Weakening Active Hydrogen Adsorption to Boost the Hydrogen Transfer Reaction over a Cu&#8208;Ag Superlattice Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prerequisite for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) is H2O splitting to form surface hydrogen species (*H), which occupy catalytic sites and lead to mismatched coverage of *H and reactants, resulting in unsatisfactory activity and selectivity. Thus, modulating the splitting pathway of H2O is significant for optimizing the EHR process. Herein, a Cu&#8208;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure of staggered&#8208;ordered Cu and Ag is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to undergo a pathway for H2O splitting called the hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) in the water layer, which involves the formation of *H, the capture of *H by a water cluster to form H*(H2O)x and subsequent hydrogenation reactions by H*(H2O)x. Taking acetylene hydrogenation as a model case, the as&#8208;proposed HTR pathway could lead to a relaxation hydrogenation process to modulate the matching degree of C2H2 and *H, thus enabling a 91.2% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency at a partial current density of 0.38 A cm&#8722;&#8201;2, greatly outperforming its counterpart without a superlattice structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Restructured Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), praised for structural flexibility and tunability, are prominent catalyst prototypes for exploring oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their intricate transformations under OER, especially in industrial high&#8208;current environments, pose significant challenges in accurately elucidating their structure&#8208;activity correlation. Here, we harnessed an electrooxidation process for controllable MOF reconstruction, discovering that Fe doping expedites Ni(Fe)&#8208;MOF structural evolution, accompanied by the elongation of Ni&#8208;O bonds, monitored by in&#8208;situ Raman and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Theoretical modeling further reveals that Fe doping and defect&#8208;induced tensile strain in the NiO6 octahedra augments the metal ds&#8208;Op hybridization, optimizing their adsorption behavior and augmenting OER activity. The reconstructed Ni(Fe)&#8208;MOF, serving as the anode in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves a noteworthy current density of 3.3 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.2 V while maintaining equally stable operation for 160 h spanning from 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 to 1 A cm&#8208;2. This undertaking elevates our comprehension of OER catalyst reconstruction, furnishing promising avenues for designing highly efficacious catalysts across electrochemical platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aryl C&#8208;H Fluorocarbonylation with CF2Br2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of abundant and inexpensive fluorine feedstocks to synthesize fluorinated compounds is a promising strategy that has not been extensively investigated. Dibromodifluoromethane (CF2Br2) is an inexpensive fluorine source that has rarely been used for C&#8208;H fluoroalkylation. This study reveals an iridium&#8208;catalyzed, tunable strategy for synthesizing acyl fluorides and difluorobromomethylated products using CF2Br2. To achieve the desired products, this process only requires the change of solvent (from DMSO to 1,4&#8208;dioxane) under blue LED illumination. A variety of arenes and heteroarenes with electron&#8208;donating substituents were successfully used, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic experiments revealed that DMSO served a dual role, functioning as both solvent and nucleophilic reagent in C&#8208;H fluorocarbonylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;supporting Single&#8208;component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction's induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200 hours of PDH operation at 550 &#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000 hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2 introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Opal&#8208;Inspired SiO2&#8208;Mediated Carbon Dot Doping Enables the Synthesis of Monodisperse Multifunctional Afterglow Nanocomposites for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advancements in inorganic and organic phosphors, creating monodisperse afterglow nanocomposites (NCs) remains challenging due to the complexities of wet chemistry synthesis. Inspired by nanoinclusions in opal, we introduce a novel SiO2&#8208;mediated carbon dot (CD) doping method for fabricating monodisperse, multifunctional afterglow NCs. This method involves growing a SiO2 shell matrix on monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) and doping CDs into the SiO2 shell under hydrothermal conditions. Our approach preserves the monodispersity of the parent NP@SiO2 NCs while activating a green afterglow in the doped CDs with an impressive lifetime of 1.26 s. Additionally, this method is highly versatile, allowing for various core and dopant combinations to finely tune the afterglow through core&#8208;to&#8208;CD or CD&#8208;to&#8208;dye energy transfer. Our findings significantly enhance the potential of SiO2 coatings, transforming them from merely enhancing the biocompatibility of NCs to serving as a versatile matrix for emitters, facilitating afterglow generation and paving the way for new applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetic acid, a key intermediate compound, is synthesized by oxidization of ethane with H2O2 at 0&#8201;&#176;C at ambient pressure through an integrated thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. The selectivity for producing acetic acid reaches 98.7&#8201;%. The positively charged Pd1 atom with an adsorbed OH group is the site for activating the first C&#8722;H of C2H6 with an energy barrier of only 0.14&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8722;Pd1

/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8722;H instead of C&#8722;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14&#8197;eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7&#8201;%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#8201;&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Ion Covalent Organic Framework Electrolytes Enabled by Nitrile Migration Ladders for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered the key importance of nitrile (&#8722;CN) functionality and for the first time developed a novel single&#8208;ion conducting COF electrolyte (CN&#8722;iCOF) that is high&#8208;voltage stable in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Utilizing Strecker reaction to convert the reversible imine&#8208;based linkage to a stable &#945;&#8208;aminonitrile linkage, azanide&#8208;based anionic centers that are adjacent to the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups were generated followed by deprotonation. When the CN&#8722;iCOF was assembled in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries, excellent performance including stable Li electrodeposition and reversible high&#8208;voltage battery cycling up to 4.5&#8197;V was achieved at ambient temperature. The revealed significance of nitrile functionality and the design of new COF structures with high Li+ transport and high electrochemical stability shed light on a novel approach for the rational design of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high&#8208;voltage, and energy&#8208;dense lithium metal batteries. Herein, taking advantage of the unique electronic effect of nitrile groups, we designed a novel azanide&#8208;based single&#8208;ion covalent organic framework (CN&#8722;iCOF) structure that possesses effective Li+ transport and high&#8208;voltage stability in lithium metal batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) revealed that electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups not only resulted in an ultralow HOMO energy orbital but also enhanced Li+ dissociation through charge delocalization, leading to a high tLi+ of 0.93 and remarkable oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) simultaneously. Moreover, cyanation leveraging Strecker reaction transformed reversible imine&#8208;linkage to a stable sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing azanide anion, which facilitated contorted alignment of transport &#8220;ladders&#8221; along the one&#8208;dimensional anionic channels and the ionic conductivity could reach 1.33&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at ambient temperature without any additives. As a result, CN&#8722;iCOF allowed operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811), demonstrating stable lithium deposition up to 1,100&#8197;h and reversible battery cycling at ambient temperature up to 4.5&#8197;V, shedding light on the importance of discovering new functionality for forthcoming high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>One Iron for Two Iron Sites in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward Simultaneous N2&#8722;H2 Activation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron site in a metal&#8211;organic framework skeleton was introduced as an activator for the two types of iron sites in Fe3O4. Integration of these three kinds of iron sites in one catalytic system exhibited a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; effect, which played the roles in nitrogen activation, hydrogen activation and products transfer simultaneously, and hydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia was achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts play an important role in the ammonia industry. As one of the most abundant iron minerals, Fe3O4 containing FeII and FeIII sites is widely distributed in the earth's crust and even on exoplanets, theoretically giving it both economic and catalytic potentials in ammonia synthesis. However, in the absence of specific active co&#8208;catalyst and harsh conditions, Fe3O4 is impossible to achieve ammonia synthesis alone. Here, we designed to activate the relatively inert FeII and FeIII sites in Fe3O4 with a third FeIII site inlayed in a coordination framework (MIL&#8208;101(Fe)) to achieve the unpresented multi&#8208;site collaborative catalysis. In&#8208;depth mechanism study confirmed the roles of three different Fe sites in N2 activation, H2 activation, and product transfer, respectively. Efficient N2&#8722;H2 activation to NH3 on the Fe3O4&#8208;based catalytic system has been achieved at extremely mild conditions. Our research provides a theoretical basis and a new strategy for designing efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based ammonia synthesis catalyst with minimized energy consumption.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Template&#8208;Guided Synthesis of High&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies for Humidity Gradient&#8208;Based Power Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organized assembly of fundamental building blocks into intricate molecular architectures remains challenging due to the dynamic building blocks. A general strategy has been developed to synthesize high&#8208;dimensional complex architectures by choosing appropriate anion templates and flexible, non&#8208;planar organic linkers. Further, the complex architecture possesses multifunctions suitable for humidity&#8208;electric power generation.







Abstract
Systematically orchestrating fundamental building blocks into intricate high&#8208;dimensional molecular assemblies at molecular level is imperative for multifunctionality integration. However, this remains a formidable task in crystal engineering due to the dynamic nature of inorganic building blocks. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;template&#8208;guided strategy to control building blocks. The coordination modes of ligands and the spatial hindrance of anionic templates are pivotal in dictating the overall structures. Flexible multi&#8208;dentate linkers selectively promote the formation of oligomeric assembly ([TeO3(Mo2O2S2)3O2(OH)(C5O2H7)3]4&#8722; {TeMo6}) into tetrahedral cages ([(TeO3)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O4P)6]8&#8722; {Te4Mo24} and [(AsO4)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O6)4]12&#8722; {As4Mo24}), while steric hindrance from anionic templates further assists in assembling cages into an open quadruply twisted M&#246;bius nanobelt ([(C6H5O3P)8(Mo2O2S2)24(OH)24(C8H10O4)12]16&#8722; {P8Mo48}). Among these structures, the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic hybrid cage {Te4Mo24} emerges as an exemplary molecular model for proton conduction and serves as a prototype for humidity gradient&#8208;based power generators (HGPGs). The Te4Mo24&#8208;PVDF&#8208;based HGPG (PVDF=Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) exhibits notable stability and power generation, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.51&#8197;V and a current density of 77.8&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Further insights into the interactions between water molecules and microscale molecules within the generator are achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. This endeavor unveils a universal strategy for synthesizing multifunctional integration molecules.

         <title>Multifunctional Self&#8208;Assembled Bio&#8208;Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is employed as an electrolyte additive in the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte, which can form a bio&#8208;interfacial layer on the Zinc (Zn) anode via a self&#8208;assembly process. The BSA&#8208;based interfacial layer with hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments forms unique ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions and contributing to improved cycling performance.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion (Zn&#8208;ion) batteries are widely regarded as important candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems for low&#8208;cost renewable energy storage. However, the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries is currently facing significant challenges due to uncontrollable Zn dendrite growth and severe parasitic reactions on Zn metal anodes. Herein, we report an effective strategy to improve the performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries by leveraging the self&#8208;assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) into a bilayer configuration on Zn metal anodes. BSA&#8242;s hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments form unique and intelligent ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions on Zn anodes and leading to a uniform Zn deposition along the Zn (002) plane. Notably, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell with BSA as the electrolyte additive demonstrated a stable cycling performance for up to 2400&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the pivotal role of self&#8208;assembled protein bilayer structures in improving the durability of Zn anodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

This work demonstrates the pivotal role of self-assembled protein bilayer structures in improving the durability of Zn anodes in aqueous Zn-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Antisite Defect and Coupling Anionic Redox in High&#8208;Voltage Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect and its coupling relationship with anionic redox in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes are revealed using operando neutron diffraction techniques. Further, a strategy that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes is proposed.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2, x&#8805;0.9) can significantly enhance the energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of Li&#8208;ion batteries beyond current levels. However, severe Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high&#8208;voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5&#8197;V cycling stability.

         <title>A Highly Stable and Non&#8208;Flammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>Recyclable Polythioesters and Poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s via Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Polymerization of Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens a new paradigm for polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride based on a S&#8208;to&#8208;N shift reaction, producing unexpected recyclable polythioesters and unprecedent poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s.







Abstract
Polythioesters (PTEs) are emerging sustainable polymers for their degradability and recyclability. However, low polymerizability of monomers and extensive side reactions often hampered the polymerization process. Moreover, copolymers containing both thioester and other types of functional groups in the backbone are highly desirable but rarely accomplished owing to several synthetic challenges. Here, we report the ring&#8208;opening cascade polymerization (ROCAP) of N&#8208;(2&#8208;(acetylthio)ethyl)&#8208;glycine N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (TE&#8208;NCA) to afford recyclable PTEs and unprecedented poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s (P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s) in a controlled manner. By developing appropriated carboxylic acid&#8208;tertiary amine dual catalysts, intramolecular S&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift is coupled into the ROCAP process of TE&#8208;NCA to yield products with dispersity below 1.10, molecular weight (Mn) up to 84.5&#8197;kDa, and precisely controlled ratio of thioester to peptoids. Random copolymerization of sarcosine NCA (Sar&#8208;NCA) and TE&#8208;NCA gives thioester&#8208;embedded polysarcosine with facile backbone degradation while maintaining the water solubility. This work represents a paradigm shift for the ROP of NCAs, enriches the realm of cascade polymerizations, and provides a powerful synthetic approach to functional PTEs and P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s that are otherwise difficult or impossible to make.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol was achieved by using a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, aldol/elimination reaction to assemble the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations.







Abstract
Kalmanol, the flagship member of the kalmane diterpene family, possesses a complex and highly oxidized 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton with nine contiguous stereocenters and exhibits significant analgesic effects and cardiotoxic properties. We have achieved the efficient total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol in 22&#8197;steps with 2.3&#8201;% yield. The synthesis featured a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations of the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton.

         <title>Successively Controlling Nanoscale Wrinkles of Ultrathin 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose manipulating MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions to control the synthesis of wrinkled Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;CX nanosheets. Using C1 to C8 acids as modulators, varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alters wrinkle sizes. Increased hydrophobicity strengthens MOF&#8208;MOF interactions and weakens MOF&#8208;solvent interactions, producing larger wrinkles. Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C2, Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C3, and Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 show increased nanoscale wrinkles, with Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 having the largest pores, enhancing GC separation performance.







Abstract
The wrinkles are pervasive in ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, but the regulation of wrinkles is rarely explored systematically. Here, we employed a series of carboxylic acids (from formic acid to octanoic acid) to control the wrinkles of Zr&#8208;BTB (BTB=1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet. The wrinkles at the micrometer scale were observed with transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field (HAADF) images showed lattice distortion in many nanoscale regions, which was precisely matched to the nano&#8208;wrinkles. With the changes of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions were possibly synergistically regulated and wrinkles with different sizes were obtained, which was supported by HAADF, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculation.

     alt="Successively Controlling Nanoscale Wrinkles of Ultrathin 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose manipulating MOF-MOF and MOF-solvent interactions to control the synthesis of wrinkled Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. Using C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; acids as modulators, varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alters wrinkle sizes. Increased hydrophobicity strengthens MOF-MOF interactions and weakens MOF-solvent interactions, producing larger wrinkles. Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; show increased nanoscale wrinkles, with Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; having the largest pores, enhancing GC separation performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrinkles are pervasive in ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials, but the regulation of wrinkles is rarely explored systematically. Here, we employed a series of carboxylic acids (from formic acid to octanoic acid) to control the wrinkles of Zr-BTB (BTB=1, 3, 5-(4-carboxylphenyl)-benzene) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet. The wrinkles at the micrometer scale were observed with transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images showed lattice distortion in many nanoscale regions, which was precisely matched to the nano-wrinkles. With the changes of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, MOF-MOF and MOF-solvent interactions were possibly synergistically regulated and wrinkles with different sizes were obtained, which was supported by HAADF, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculation. Different wrinkle sizes resulted in different pore sizes between the Zr-BTB nanosheet interlayers, providing highly-oriented thin films and the successive optimization of kinetic diffusion pathways, proved by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and nitrogen adsorption. The most suitable wrinkle pore from Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited highly efficient chromatographic separation of the substituted benzene isomers. Our work provides a rational route for the modulation of nanoscale wrinkles and their stacked pores of MOF nanosheets and improves the separation abilities of MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzocoronene core&#8208;expanded graphdiyne nanosheets with a sixfold symmetry were synthesized on Au(111) via dehydrogenative coupling reactions of ethyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene. Their chemical and electronic configurations were thoroughly investigated using scanning probe microscopy, providing a band gap (2.8&#8197;eV) of a single&#8208;layer graphdiyne&#8208;like nanosheet.







Abstract
Thermally&#8208;induced dehydrogenative coupling of polyphenylenes on metal surfaces is an important technique to synthesize

&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.

         <title>Exploring Geometric Chirality in Nanocrystals for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of geometric chiral effect was explored to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution using a chiral composite of geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) and C3N4 nanosheets. The chiral Au NPs enable efficient charge carrier separation and high&#8208;activity facets, boosting performance over achiral counterparts and resulting in a quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance was also revealed.







Abstract
Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.

         <dc:description>
Confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with copper single atoms (CuSAs) inside defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals is achieved by the straightforward method of low&#8208;temperature thermolysis. The prepared composite CuSAs@PCN@UiO, combining the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis, exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added fuels displays an attractive scenario to enhance energy supply and reduce global warming. We report herein the confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with Cu single atoms (CuSAs) inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which combines the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) to achieve high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. A series of spectral studies displays the formation of CuSAs@PCN inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, the ternary composite shows an excellent photocatalytic turnover frequency of 4.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type&#8208;II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH3OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for CO2 conversion to fuels at atomic scale.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of High&#8208;Rate Copper Electrochemical Machining in Nitrate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution mechanism of copper during high&#8208;rate electrochemical machining in nitrate electrolyte is investigated and proposed to change to overcome mass transport limitation. Prerequisites are derived from polarization measurements under various (hydrodynamic) conditions. A new complexation mechanism involving nitrate ions is proposed at overlimiting currents.







Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.

         <title>Electrolyte Composition&#8208;Dependent Product Selectivity in CO2 Reduction with a Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major product of electrochemical CO2 reduction on a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was found to switch from CO to formic acid upon electrolyte composition changing. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies indicates pathway steering by addition of extra proton source to the electrolyte.







Abstract
A copper porphyrin&#8208;derived metal&#8211;organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN&#8208;8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst&#8208;bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Fence&#8208;Type Molecular Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To attain high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries, we've proposed a novel strategy for fence&#8208;type molecular electrocatalyst. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer (as catalyst), via nucleophilic substitution formation, creates a reaction space for multiphase transformation of sulfur species. And the uniformly distributed CE sites on the polymer regulate the molecular structures of sulfur species through coordination, boosting the overall redox kinetics.







Abstract
Improving the slow redox kinetics of sulfur species and shuttling issues of soluble intermediates induced from the multiphase sulfur redox reactions are crucial factors for developing the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. In this study, we successfully constructed a novel molecular electrocatalyst through in situ polymerization of bis(3,4&#8208;dibromobenzene)&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (BD18C6) with polysulfide anions on the cathode interface. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer acts as a spatial &#8220;fence&#8221; to precisely control the unique redox characteristics of sulfur species, which could confine sulfur substance within its interior and interact with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to optimize the reaction barrier of sulfur species. The &#8220;fence&#8221; structure and the double&#8208;sided Li+ penetrability of the CE molecule may also prevent the CE catalytic sites from being covered by sulfur during cycling. This new fence&#8208;type electrocatalyst mitigates the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, enhances the redox activity of sulfur species, and promotes the formation of three&#8208;dimensional stacked lithium sulfide (Li2S) simultaneously. It thus enables lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to exhibit superior rate performance and cycle stability, which may also inspire development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy&#8208;efficient conversion process.

         <title>Surficial Homogenic Effect Enables Highly Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we innovatively proposed a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition technique to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer and perovskite surface by introducing the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T). Ultimately, we successfully fabricated efficient deep&#8208;blue device delivering the stable emission at 460&#8197;nm with enhanced EQE of 5.01&#8201;% with superior half&#8208;time of 31.3&#8197;min.







Abstract
The device performance of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep&#8208;blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition method to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.

         <title>Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with an improved horizontal emitting dipole orientation, fast reverse intersystem crossing, and high photoluminescence quantum yield in a pristine film was constructed. The solution&#8208;processable non&#8208;doped device and the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.6&#8201;% and 30.7&#8201;%, respectively, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution&#8208;processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and generate a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF. Compared to its counterpart with a single TADF unit, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78&#8201;%) due to the &#960;&#8208;delocalization&#8208;induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95&#8201;% in neat film. Consequently, the non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed device with D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as the emitter achieves an ultra&#8208;high maximum EQE of 32.6&#8201;%, which remains at 26.6&#8201;% under a luminance of 1000 cd/m2. Furthermore, when using D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as a sensitizer, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibits a high maximum EQE of 30.7&#8201;% at a luminance of 575&#8197;cd/m2 and a full width at half maximum of 36&#8197;nm.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Metastable Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes with Tunable Threading Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planetary centrifugal mixing was the key to the rapid and convenient synthesis of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs). The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction served as the end&#8208;capping reaction using glutathione (GSH) to prepare metastable PRs. The GSH stoppers prevent de&#8208;threading at room temperature, such that heating controls the de&#8208;threading rate, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyrotaxanes (CD&#8208;PRs) are gaining attention for their dynamic sliding rings along the polymer axis, enabling various applications in molecular shuttles, drug delivery, and durable polymers with slidable cross&#8208;links. However, the conventional synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs with tunable threading ratios is typically laborious, time&#8208;consuming, and complicated, which limits their scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we highlight the great potential of planetary centrifugal mixing, a process that significantly accelerates and simplifies the initial synthesis of polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs), followed by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction as an efficient end&#8208;capping reaction for the synthesis of PRs. Notably, PRs synthesized with glutathione (GSH) as the end&#8208;capping reagent are in a metastable state, where GSH act as a molecular bumper that significantly prevent de&#8208;threading of &#945;&#8208;CD rings at room temperature. Moreover, the rate of ring de&#8208;threading can be precisely controlled by heating, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range. The developed strategy is of great significance to the efficient synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs, thus marking a significant step towards their practical application in advanced functional materials and devices.

Moreover, the rate of ring de-threading can be precisely controlled by heating, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range. The developed strategy is of great significance to the efficient synthesis of CD-PRs, thus marking a significant step towards their practical application in advanced functional materials and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cationic rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed, and the first example of rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;diarylcarbenes has been realized. The computational study indicates that the combination of a stereochemically favored &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction and a rotation&#8208;restricted conformation is crucial to the reaction enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough, yet Rigid and Healable Supramolecular Polymers with Variable Stiffness for Multimodal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers were developed by incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs into densely interconnected hydrogen networks, achieving both exceptional mechanical strength and dynamic chain flexibility. These materials can be utilized to create variable stiffness layers for soft actuators, enhancing their motion versatility and structural robustness.







Abstract
Variable stiffness materials have shown considerable application in soft robotics. However, previously reported materials often struggle to reconcile high stiffness, stretchability, toughness, and self&#8208;healing ability, because of the inherently conflicting requisite of these properties in molecular design. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that involves incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs capable of from strong crosslinking sites into a dense and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to construct rigid self&#8208;healing polymers with tunable stiffness and excellent toughness. To demonstrate these distinct features, the polymer was employed to serve as the strain&#8208;regulation layers within a fiber&#8208;reinforced pneumatic actuator (FPA). The exceptional synergy between the configuration versatility of FPA and the dynamic molecular behavior of the supramolecular polymers equips the actuator with simultaneous improvement in motion dexterity, multimodality, loading capacity, robustness, and durability. Additionally, the concept of integrating high dexterity at both macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale is prospective to inspire the design of intelligent yet robust devices across various domains.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Azobenzene Photoswitch for DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Regulation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are increasingly acknowledged as promising targets in cancer research, and the development of G4&#8208;specific stabilizing compounds may lay a fundamental foundation in precision medicine for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binder for precise modulation of drug activation, providing dynamic and spatiotemporal control over G4&#8208;associated biological processes contributing to cancer cell death. We developed a specialized fluorinated azobenzene (AB) switch equipped with a quinoline unit and a positively charged carboxamide side chain, Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C, designed for targeted binding to G4 structures within cells. Biophysical studies, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, provide insights into the unique coordination modes of the photoswitchable ligand in its trans and cis configurations when interacting with G4s. The observed variations in complexation processes between the two isomeric states in different cancer cell lines manifest in more than 25&#8208;fold reversible cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining conducted with the structure&#8208;specific G4 antibody (BG4), establishes a direct correlation between cytotoxicity and the varying extent of G4 induction regulated by the two isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the photo&#8208;driven reversible regulation of G4 structures in lung cancer cells by Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binders in advancing precision cancer therapy through dynamic control of G4&#8208;mediated pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Diatomic Catalysts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Mechanistic Insights and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8208;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8208;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000 cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8208;N&#8208;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8208;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8208;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (DDA) reaction is a powerful method for the construction of aromatic compounds. However, the enantioselective DDA reaction has been rarely developed, probably due to the competitive thermal reaction. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction through vinyl cation pathway. The reaction leads to the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles in generally excellent yields with good to excellent atroposelectivities. This methodology represents the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, new chiral ligand and organocatalyst derived from the constructed axially chiral carbazole are demonstrated to be useful in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Loading Lewis Acid/Base Pair on Metal Nanocluster for Catalytic Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing structurally robust and catalytically active metal nanoclusters for catalyzing multi&#8208;component reactions is an interesting while challenging task. Inspired by Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysis, we realized the combination of both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites on the surface of a stable gold nanocluster Au35Cd2. The catalytic potential of Au35Cd2 in four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was explored, demonstrating high activity and exceptional recyclability. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies indicate that the catalytic synergy of the Lewis acid/base pair is crucial for the high efficiency of Au35Cd2&#8208;catalyzed Ugi reaction. Bearing the stable structure, multiple activation sites and hierarchical chirality, Au35Cd2 is expected to display further interesting catalytic performance such as asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Constructing structurally robust and catalytically active metal nanoclusters for catalyzing multi-component reactions is an interesting while challenging task. Inspired by Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysis, we realized the combination of both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites on the surface of a stable gold nanocluster Au35Cd2. The catalytic potential of Au35Cd2 in four-component Ugi reaction was explored, demonstrating high activity and exceptional recyclability. In-depth mechanism studies indicate that the catalytic synergy of the Lewis acid/base pair is crucial for the high efficiency of Au35Cd2-catalyzed Ugi reaction. Bearing the stable structure, multiple activation sites and hierarchical chirality, Au35Cd2 is expected to display further interesting catalytic performance such as asymmetric catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual Purpose Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acid for the Expanded Genetic Code: Combining Metal&#8208;Binding and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rationally designed dual purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid (Trz) has been synthesised and successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold via genetic code expansion. Trz contains a 5&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine system, which allows for inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions to occur on the triazine ring and for metal ions to be chelated both before and after the click reaction. Trz was successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold and the IEDDA utility of Trz demonstrated through the site&#8208;specific labelling of the purified protein with a bicyclononyne. Additionally, Trz was shown to successfully coordinate a cyclometallated iridium(III) centre, providing access to a bioorthogonal luminogenic probe. The luminescent properties of the Ir(III)&#8208;bound protein blue&#8208;shift upon IEDDA click reaction with bicyclononyne, providing a unique method for monitoring the extent and location of the labelling reaction. In summary, Trz is a new dual purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid, which has great potential for myriad bioapplications where metal&#8208;based functionality is required, for example in imaging, catalysis, or photo&#8208;dynamic therapy, in conjunction with a bioorthogonal reactive handle to impart additional functionalities, such as dual modality imaging or therapeutic payloads.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavy Graphene Nanoribbons Containing Periodic Eight&#8208;Membered Rings for Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precision graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offer distinctive physicochemical properties that are highly dependent on their geometric topologies, thereby holding great potential for applications in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics. While the edge structure and width control has been a popular strategy for engineering the optoelectronic properties of GNRs, non&#8208;hexagonal&#8208;ring&#8208;containing GNRs remain underexplored due to synthetic challenges, despite offering an equally high potential for tailored properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a wavy GNR (wGNR) embedding periodic eight&#8208;membered rings into its carbon skeleton, which is achieved by the A2B2&#8208;type Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization between dibenzocyclooctadiyne (6) and dicyclopenta[e,l]pyrene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione derivative (8), followed by a selective Scholl reaction of the obtained ladder&#8208;type polymer (LTP) precursor. The obtained wGNR, with a length of up to 30 nm, is thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy with the support of DFT calculations. The non&#8208;planar geometry of wGNR efficiently prevents the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8208;&#960; aggregation, leading to photoluminescence in solution. Consequently, the wGNR can function as an emissive layer for organic light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (OLECs), offering a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept exploration in implementing luminescent GNRs into optoelectronic devices. The fast&#8208;responding OLECs employing wGNR will pave the way for advancements in OLEC technology and other optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation&#160;of CO2 by Atomically Precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+&#160;Clusters into a Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By highly efficient ligand&#8208;exchange strategy, atomically precise Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ (PPh3 = triphenylphosphine) cluster can be transformed into a Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ (DPPF = 1,1'&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) cluster that can maintain the atomic&#8208;packing structure but overcome the lability of Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+. Catalytic evaluation for the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine demonstrates that the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst can remarkably enhance both activity and stability&#160;compared to the Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ catalyst. More notably, the direct construction of a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (2D MOF) can be elaborately accomplished in the formylation process of o&#8208;phenylenediamine, CO2 and H2 with zinc nitrate enabled by the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst. The 2D MOF further enables the capture and transformation of CO2 to combine in the organic synthesis with epoxides under mild conditions.This work provides opportunities for creating highly active cluster sites for the chemical recycling of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge Transfer Emitters Utilizing Hyperconjugation Effect Towards Solution&#8208;Processed Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency Approaching 12%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state materials, which possess weak donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) pure organic structures, deserve one of the most promising efficient and stable blue emitters. Through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, 75% triplet excitons generated by electrical excitation could be harvested and utilized in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, there are still significant challenges to achieve high&#8208;efficiency ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters with low Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinate y values. Here, a series of novel blue HLCT emitters based on spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2'&#8208;imidazole] structure were designed and synthesized by fine&#8208;tuning the spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,2'&#8208;imidazole] core structure in our previous work through heteroatom substitution and hyperconjugation effect. The target emitters were endowed with excellent photophysical and electrochemical merits, thermal stability and solution processibility. The solution&#8208;processed OLED device based on 4',5'&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2'&#8208;imidazole] (NFIP&#8208;CZ) achieved efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y = 0.1581, 0.0422) with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax), maximum current efficiency (CEmax) and maximum power efficiency (PEmax) of 11.94%, 4.07 cd&#183;A&#8208;1 and 2.56 lm&#183;W&#8208;1. The record EQE is a breakthrough in both solution&#8208;processed and vacuum vapor deposition ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue HLCT&#8208;OLEDs currently.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;based nanofibers are promising materials for many essential applications and can be generalized into two categories, self&#8208;assembling peptide nanofibers (SAPNs) and poly(amino acid) nanofibers (PAANs). Non&#8208;covalent SAPNs are sequence&#8208;controllable, but poorly stable and not suitable for post&#8208;modification. While covalent PAANs are post&#8208;modifiable, however, their sequences are either monotonic or undefined. The nanofibers obtained by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail covalent coupling polymerization of sequence&#8208;known peptides, which we call series&#8208;connected peptide nanofibers (SCPNs), promise to have the advantages of both SAPNs and PAANs, but they are barely reported. The undesired backbiting effect during the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail polymerization is one of the possible challenges. Here, we present a template&#8208;assisted strategy to trigger the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid transition of peptide units, which can avoid the backbiting effect and enable consecutive intermolecular polymerization of peptides to produce desired sequence&#8208;controlled covalent SCPNs. SCPNs are highly stable and can function as excellent parent materials for various post&#8208;processing to create diverse hierarchical materials independent of the peptide sequence. Moreover, SCPNs allow for the display of predetermined functional groups at regular intervals along the nanofibers by pre&#8208;modification of the initial peptide sequence. SCPNs represent a new category of peptide&#8208;based nanofibers with outstanding performances and vast potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycosylated AIE&#8208;active Red Light&#8208;triggered Photocage with Precisely Tumor Targeting Capability for Synergistic Type I Photodynamic Therapy and CPT Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaging is an emerging protocol for precisely manipulating spatial and temporal behaviors over biological activity. However, the red/near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered&#160;photolysis process of current photocage is largely singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;dependent and lack of compatibility with other reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated techniques, which has proven to be the major bottleneck in achieving efficient and precise treatment. Herein, we reported a lactosylated photocage BT&#8208;LRC by covalently incorporating camptothecin (CPT) into hybrid BODIPY&#8208;TPE fluorophore via the superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;)&#8208;cleavable thioketal bond for type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anticancer drug release. Amphiphilic BT&#8208;LRC could be self&#8208;assembled into aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanoparticles (BT&#8208;LRCs) owing to the regulation of carbohydrate&#8208;carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) among neighboring lactose units in the nanoaggregates. BT&#8208;LRCs could simultaneously&#160;generate abundant O2&#8722;&#8226; through the aggregation modulated by lactose interactions, and DNA&#8208;damaging agent CPT was subsequently and effectively released. Notably, the type I PDT and CPT chemotherapy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic efficacy in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Furthermore, the inherent AIE property of BT&#8208;LRCs endowed the photocaged prodrug with superior bioimaging capability, which provided a powerful tool for real&#8208;time tracking and finely tuning the PDT and photoactivated drug release behavior in tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced &#8216;Click Reaction&#8217; Involving Coordination and Covalent Assembly of Hybrid Borates for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexity&#8208;Building Exhaustive Dearomatization of Benzenoid Aromatics within an ESIPT&#8208;Initiated Three&#8208;Step Photochemical Cascade.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloadditions offer rapid access to complex 3D molecular architectures, commonly via a sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 rehybridization of two atoms of an aromatic ring. Here we report that the 6e &#960;&#8208;system of a benzenoid aromatic pendant could be exhaustively depleted within a single photochemical cascade. An implementation of this approach involves the initial dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition of the Exited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;generated azaxylylene, followed by two consecutive [2+2] cycloadditions of auxiliary &#960; moieties strategically positioned in the photoprecursor. Such photochemical cascade fully dearomatizes the benzenoid aromatic ring, saturating all six sp2 atoms to yield a complex sp3&#8208;rich scaffold with high control of its 3D molecular shape, rendering it a robust platform for rapid systematic mapping of underexplored chemical space. Significant growth of molecular complexity &#8211; starting with a modular synthesis of photoprecursors from readily available building blocks &#8211; is quantified by B&#246;ttcher score calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization with Conductive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low sensitivity of liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be overcome by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP). It consists of transferring the near&#8208;unity polarization of unpaired electron spins of stable radicals to the nuclear spins of interest at liquid helium temperatures, below 2 K, before melting the sample in view of hyperpolarized liquid&#8208;state magnetic resonance experiments. Reaching such a temperature is challenging and requires complex instrumentation, which impedes the deployment of dDNP. Here, we propose organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) as a new class of polarizing matrices and report&#160;1H polarizations of up to 5%. We also show that&#160;13C spins of a host solution impregnated in porous conductive polymers can be hyperpolarized by relayed DNP. Such conductive polymers can be synthesized as chiral and display current induced spin selectivity leading to electron spins hyperpolarization close to unity without the need for low temperatures nor high magnetic fields. Our results show the feasibility of solid&#8208;state DNP in conductive polymers that are known to exhibit chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Nucleophile Coupling: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deborylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis for their diverse reactivity, modular preparation, and stability compared to other classes of organometallic reagents. While organoboron species are commonly employed as nucleophiles in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, their potential as racemic building blocks in enantioconvergent transformations remains largely untapped. Herein, we demonstrate the&#160;direct utilization of alkylboronic pinacol esters in intermolecular enantioconvergent transformations. Specifically, this work describes the development and mechanistic study of an enantioconvergent deborylative cyanation enabled by Cu catalysis. This method imparts a high degree of enantioselectivity and tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a radical&#8208;relay mechanism. Aniline&#8208;assisted homolysis of the carbon&#8211;boron bond results in prochiral alkyl radicals that are functionalized by in situ generated Cu(II)(CN)2 species in an enantioselective fashion. The Cu(II)(CN)2 intermediate was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and its electronic structure was probed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Computational studies were carried out to corroborate the proposed radical&#8208;relay mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bidentate N-ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi-oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi-oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation.

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Film Formation Kinetics for Record Efficiency in Difluorobenzothiadizole&#8208;based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron&#8208;accepting building blocks used to construct D&#8208;A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT&#8208;based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene&#8208;based OSCs owing to their strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, incorporating different &#960;&#8208;bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT&#8208;4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8&#8208;BO compared to PffBT&#8208;2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT&#8208;4T&#8208;based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5%, setting a new record for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers. Our findings underscore the importance of conjugate backbone modulation in controlling aggregation behavior and film formation kinetics, providing valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance polymer donors in organic photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of Silver&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for NO Electroreduction to NH3 by DFT Calculations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring NO reduction reaction (NORR) electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity toward NH3 is essential for both NO removal and NH3 synthesis. Due to their superior electrocatalytic activities, single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted considerable attention. However, the exploration of SAAs is hindered by a lack of fast yet reliable prediction of catalytic performance. To address this problem, we comprehensively screened a series of transition&#8208;metal atom doped Ag&#8208;based SAAs. This screening process involves regression machine learning (ML) algorithms and a compressed&#8208;sensing data&#8208;analytics approach parameterized with density&#8208;functional inputs. The results demonstrate that Cu/Ag and Zn/Ag can efficiently activate and hydrogenate NO with small &#934;max(&#951;), a grand&#8208;canonical adaptation of the Gmax(&#951;) descriptor, and exhibit higher affinity to NO over H adatoms to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The NH3 selectivity is mainly determined by the s orbitals of the doped single&#8208;atom near the Fermi level. The catalytic activity of SAAs is highly correlated with the local environment of the active site. We further quantified the relationship between the intrinsic features of these active sites and &#934;max(&#951;). Our work clarifies the mechanism of NORR to NH3 and offers a design principle to guide the screen of highly active SAA catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on AuCu Single&#8208;atom Alloy Aerogels under Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is very attractive for nitrate removal and ammonia production in industrial processes. However, the nitrate reduction reaction is characterized by intense hydrogen competition at strong reduction potentials, which greatly limits the Faraday efficiency at strong reduction potentials. Herein, we reported an AuxCu single&#8208;atom alloy aerogels (AuxCu SAAs) with three&#8208;dimensional network structure with significant nitrate reduction performance of Faraday efficiency (FE) higher than 90% over a wide potential range (0 ~ &#8208;1 VRHE). The FE of the catalyst was close to 100% at a high reduction potential of &#8208;0.8 VRHE, accompanying with NH3 yield reaching 6.21 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2. More importantly, the catalyst maintained a long&#8208;term operation over 400 h at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 for the NO3RR using a continuous flow system in a H&#8208;cell. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the catalyst can lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation reaction of *NO2, leading to a rapid consumption of the generated *H, facilitate the hydrogenation process of NO3RR, and inhibit the competitive HER at high overpotentials, which efficiently promotes the nitrate reduction reaction, especially in industrial applications.</dc:description>

Profiting from excellent interfacial passivation, electron injection, carrier mobility, hole blocking, and thermal stability of 3P, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.2&#8201;% and operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;h at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were realized, representing one of the highest performances in P&#8208;QLEDs.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs), abbreviated as P&#8208;QLEDs have been regarded as significantly crucial emitters for lighting and displays. Efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs still lack ideal electron transport materials (ETM), which could efficiently block hole, transport electron, reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination and possess high thermal stability. Here, we report 2,4,6&#8208;Tris(3&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl) biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TmPPPyTz, 3P) with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing moieties of pyridine and triazine to modulate the performance of P&#8208;QLEDs. Compared with commonly used 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi), the pyridine in 3P have a strong interaction with perovskites, which can effectively suppress the interface non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by the Pb2+ defects on the surface of QDs. In addition, 3P have deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (enhancing hole&#8208;blocking properties), matched lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and excellent electron mobility (enhancing electron transport properties), realizing the carrier balance and maximizing the exciton recombination. Furthermore, high thermal resistance of 3P obviously improves the stability of QDs under variable temperature, continuous UV illumination, and electric field excitation. Resultantly, the P&#8208;QLEDs using the 3P as ETM achieved an outstanding performance with a champion EQE of 30.2&#8201;% and an operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 151&#8201;% and about 11&#8208;fold improvement compared to control devices (EQE=20&#8201;%, T50=297&#8197;hours), respectively. These results provide a new concept for constructing the efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs from the perspective of selective ETM.

Abstract
In the field of industrial semi&#8208;hydrogenation of trace alkynes amidst alkene feedstocks, the pivotal challenge lies in circumventing the hydrogenation of alkenes. Herein, we present Zr(OH)4 as an innovative catalyst for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, demonstrating remarkable selectivity towards styrene (&gt;96&#8201;%), while exhibiting inactivity towards free styrene. Notably, Zr(OH)4 achieves a 95&#8201;% conversion of quasi&#8208;industry 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% phenylacetylene within styrene, with a mere 0.44&#8201;% styrene loss. Experimental and theoretical results confirm both terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H and bridge Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H can dissociate H2, while the terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H plays a crucial role on activating phenylacetylene through the sequential hydrogenation process of C6H5C&#8801;CH&#8594;C6H5C=CH2&#8594;C6H5CH=CH2. The high rate of phenylacetylene removal is attributed to its strong adsorption capacity, while Zr(OH)4 has a significantly weaker adsorption capacity for styrene.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly of glycan nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy granted access to previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, allowing for molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of carbohydrates.







Abstract
A comprehensive molecular understanding of carbohydrate aggregation is key to optimize carbohydrate utilization and to engineer bioinspired analogues with tailored shapes and properties. However, the lack of well&#8208;defined synthetic standards has substantially hampered advances in this field. Herein, we employ a phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, including elongated platelets, helical bundles, and hexagonal particles. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis provided molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of these oligosaccharides, establishing a direct connection between the resulting morphologies and the oligosaccharide primary sequence. Our findings demonstrate that ETA is a powerful approach to elucidate the intrinsic aggregation behavior of carbohydrates in nature. Moreover, the ability to access a diverse array of morphologies, expanded with a non&#8208;natural sequence, underscores the potential of ETA, coupled with sequence design, as a robust tool for accessing programmable glycan architectures.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ripening Enabled by Hygroscopic Salts for Hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;Free Printable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 20&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ripening induced by the synergy of hygroscopic salt and moisture is reported for preparing efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with efficiency surpassing 20&#8201;%. The post&#8208;treatment enables significant secondary crystallization of perovskite through moisture absorption which liquefies the grain boundary and activates sufficient mass transfer by offering channels and promoting desired dissolution.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskite films generally possess small grain sizes and high density of grain boundaries, which intensify non&#8208;radiative recombination of carriers and limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. In this study, we report the room&#8208;temperature ripening enabled by the synergy of hygroscopic salts and moisture in air for efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs). Treating perovskite films with proper hygroscopic salts in damp air induces obvious secondary recrystallization, which coarsens the grains size from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. It's proposed that the hygroscopic salt at grain boundaries could absorb moisture and form a complex which could not only serve as mass transfer channel but also assist in the dissolution of perovskite grains. This activates mass transfer between small grains and large grains since they possess different solubilities, and thus ripens the perovskite film. Consequently, p&#8208;MPSCs treated with the hygroscopic salt of NH4SCN show an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.13&#8201;% from 17.94&#8201;%, and maintain &gt;98&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point tracking at 55&#177;5&#8201;&#176;C for 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Heterobenzylic Amines via Carbonyl Azinylative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium metal&#8208;mediated carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) reaction provides an operationally straightforward protocol for the multicomponent coupling carbonyls, amines and 2&#8208;iodo azines to form &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines. This modular reaction displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. These amines possess a high degree of functionality, are challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs attractive to the design of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Transformations enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines by addition of 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;based nucleophiles to in situ&#8208;generated and non&#8208;activated alkyl&#8208;substituted iminium ions are extremely rare. Approaches involving classical 2&#8208;azinyl organometallics, such as the corresponding Grignard reagents, often fail to produce the desired products. Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2&#8208;azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2&#8208;iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2&#8208;azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Using In situ Transmission Electron Microscopy to Study Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is currently a prominent subject of study in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Comprehending the atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of SMSI is crucial for directing the design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts. This article reviews the latest advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) research on SMSI. It also offers a concise overview of the obstacles and potential solutions for future progress in this emerging domain.







Abstract
Precisely controlling the microstructure of supported metal catalysts and regulating metal&#8208;support interactions at the atomic level are essential for achieving highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) not only stabilizes metal nanoparticles and improves their resistance to sintering but also modulates the electrical interaction between metal species and the support, optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, understating the formation mechanism of SMSI and its dynamic evolution during the chemical reaction at the atomic scale is crucial for guiding the structural design and performance optimization of supported metal catalysts. Recent advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have shed new light on these complex phenomena, providing deeper insights into the SMSI dynamics. Here, the research progress of in situ TEM investigation on SMSI in heterogeneous catalysis is systematically reviewed, focusing on the formation dynamics, structural evolution during the catalytic reactions, and regulation methods of SMSI. The significant advantages of in situ TEM technologies for SMSI research are also highlighted. Moreover, the challenges and probable development paths of in situ TEM studies on the SMSI are also provided.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Mimetic Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic molecular mimic metal&#8208;free catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized graphite exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and 99&#8201;% selectivity for the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
The direct construction of metal&#8208;free catalysts on conductive substrates for electrocatalytic organic hydrogenation reactions is significant but still unexplored. Here, learning from the homogeneous molecular catalysts, an organic molecular mimetic metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, 99&#8201;% selectivity and 96&#8201;% yield of the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. The removal of these oxygen&#8208;containing groups leads to negligible activity. The experimental and calculation results reveal that the origin of the high activity can be assigned to the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups on graphite. A flow electrolytic cell delivers ten grams of hydrogenated products with 81&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. This metal&#8208;free catalyst is also suitable for gas&#8208;phase acetylene semihydrogenation and other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Progressive Endergonic Synthesis of Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts Driven by Chemical Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going uphill. While most chemical reactions proceed towards equilibrium, we describe herein how to drive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions away from equilibrium (&#916;G &gt;0) using the hydration energy of carbodiimides. Our strategy yielded products up to 400&#8201;% of what thermodynamics would allow at equilibrium. Progressive accumulation upon repeated fueling cycles unlocks adaptive behaviors in chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.

         <title>Nonalternant B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Containing Azepines: Programmable Synthesis, Responsive Chiroptical Properties and Spontaneous Resolution into a Single&#8208;Handed Helix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a programmable and modular approach to fledged B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes was achieved by stepwise Scholl reactions with privileged formation of [9]helicene moiety. The controllable integration of negatively curved azepines into 6 afforded the dynamic chiral skeleton, which induced spontaneous resolution into single&#8208;handed helix at the single&#8208;crystal scale.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (NGs) constitute an important and appealing class of intrinsically chiral materials. In this work, a series of B,N&#8208;embedded helical NGs (BN&#8208;HNGs) bearing azepines was synthesized via stepwise regioselective cyclodehydrogenation. First, the phenyl&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;bridged dimers were efficiently clipped into highly congested model compounds 1 and 2. Later, the controllable Scholl reactions of the tetraphenyl&#8208;tethered precursor generated 1, 7 or 8 new C&#8722;C bonds, thereby establishing a robust method for the preparation of nonalternant BN&#8208;HNGs with up to 31 fused rings. The helical bilayer nature was unambiguously verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The helical chirality was transferred to the stereogenic boron centers upon fluoride coordination, with a concave&#8208;concave structure to comply with the bilayer skeleton. Notably, the largest nonalternant BN&#8208;HNG (6) spontaneously resolved into a homochiral 41 helix structure as a molecular spiral staircase during crystallization via conglomerate formation at the single&#8208;crystal scale. The large twisted C2&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;surface and the dynamic chiral skeleton induced by curved azepines might have synergistic effects on self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers of 6 to achieve the intriguing spontaneous resolution behavior. The chiroptical properties of the enantiomer of 6 were further investigated, revealing that 6 had a strong chiroptical response in the visible range (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

         <title>Regioselective Oxidative Phenol Coupling by a Mushroom Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phlegmacin biosynthesis in the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer reveals that CoUPO1, an unspecific peroxygenase, catalyzes the dimerization step by regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative phenol coupling. This study demonstrates that mushrooms evolved aryl coupling independently of any other group of organisms.







Abstract
Bioactive dimeric (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are ubiquitous in nature and are found in bacteria, fungi, insects, and plants. Their biosynthesis via oxidative phenol coupling (OPC) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, peroxidases, or laccases. While the biocatalysis of OPC in molds (Ascomycota) is well&#8208;known, the respective enzymes in mushroom&#8208;forming fungi (Basidiomycota) are unknown. Here, we report on the biosynthesis of the atropisomers phlegmacin A1 and B1 of the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer. The biosynthesis of these unsymmetrically 7,10&#8217;&#8208;homo&#8208;coupled dihydroanthracenones was heterologously reconstituted in the mold Aspergillus niger. Methylation of the parental monomer atrochrysone to its 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl ether torosachrysone by the O&#8208;methyltransferase CoOMT1 precedes the regioselective homocoupling to phlegmacin, catalyzed by the enzyme CoUPO1 annotated as an &#8220;unspecific peroxygenase&#8221; (UPO). Our results reveal an unprecedented UPO reaction, thereby expanding the biocatalytic portfolio of oxidative phenol coupling beyond the commonly reported enzymes. The results show that Basidiomycota use peroxygenases to selectively couple aryls independently of and convergently to any other group of organisms, emphasizing the central role of OPC in natural processes.

Methylation of the parental monomer atrochrysone to its 6-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyl ether torosachrysone by the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase &lt;i&gt;Co&lt;/i&gt;OMT1 precedes the regioselective homocoupling to phlegmacin, catalyzed by the enzyme &lt;i&gt;Co&lt;/i&gt;UPO1 annotated as an &#8220;unspecific peroxygenase&#8221; (UPO). Our results reveal an unprecedented UPO reaction, thereby expanding the biocatalytic portfolio of oxidative phenol coupling beyond the commonly reported enzymes. The results show that Basidiomycota use peroxygenases to selectively couple aryls independently of and convergently to any other group of organisms, emphasizing the central role of OPC in natural processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Incorporation of Pd Single&#8208;Atom Sites in Perovskite with an Excellent Selectivity toward Photocatalytic Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd active phases have been successfully incorporated in the lattices of SrTiO3 as single&#8208;atom sites (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Pd atoms with an optimized electronic structure and coordination environment facilitate the desorption of alkenes, thereby exhibiting an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability.







Abstract
Semihydrogenation is a crucial industrial process. Noble metals such as Pd have been extensively studied in semihydrogenation reactions, owing to their unique catalytic activity toward hydrogen activation. However, the overhydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes often happens due to the rather strong adsorption of alkenes on Pd active phases. Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of Pd active phases as single&#8208;atom sites in perovskite lattices such as SrTiO3 can greatly alternate the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pd active phases to facilitate the desorption of alkenes rather than further hydrogenation. Furthermore, the incorporated Pd sites can be well stabilized without sintering by a strong host&#8211;guest interaction with SrTiO3 during the activation of H species in hydrogenation reactions. As a result, the Pd incorporated SrTiO3 (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) exhibits an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability for the photocatalytic semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene. This strategy based on incorporation of active phases in perovskite lattices will have broad implications in the development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
By integrating mixed&#8208;valent redox metal center, charge/energy donor and photo&#8208;active center in one interface, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;amplified sensitivity is developed for precisely distinguishing the negative and positive acid phosphatase (ACP, prostate cancer marker), which exhibits bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence (&#8220;leap&#8221; response from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221;) at ACP threshold.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9&#8197;U&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive, and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.

         <title>New Insights for High&#8208;Through CO2 Hydrogenation to High&#8208;Quality Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional catalytic system of the composite NaFeGaZr&amp;HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst exhibits rapid responsiveness to high&#8208;throughput CO2 hydrogenation, leading to the production of liquid fuels that meet commercial gasoline standards. With an impressive space&#8208;time yield of 0.9&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, this achievement bears significant strategic importance for advancing the future development of sustainable energy.







Abstract
In the case of CO2 thermal&#8208;catalytic hydrogenation, highly selective olefin generation and subsequent olefin secondary reactions to fuel hydrocarbons in an ultra&#8208;short residence time is a huge challenge, especially under industrially feasible conditions. Here, we report a pioneering synthetic process that achieves selective production of high&#8208;volume commercial gasoline with the assistance of fast response mechanism. In situ experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the designed NaFeGaZr presents exceptional carbiding prowess, and swiftly forms carbides even at extremely brief gas residence times, facilitating olefin production. The created successive hollow zeolite HZSM&#8208;5 further reinforces aromatization of olefin diffused from NaFeGaZr via optimized mass transfer in the hollow channel of zeolite. Benefiting from its rapid response mechanism within the multifunctional catalytic system, this catalyst effectively prevents the excessive hydrogenation of intermediates and controls the swift conversion of intermediates into aromatics, even in high&#8208;throughput settings. This enables a rapid one&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons without any post&#8208;treatment, with high commercial product compatibility and space&#8208;time yield up to 0.9&#8197;kggasoline&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1. These findings from the current work can provide a shed for the preparation of efficient catalysts and in&#8208;depth understanding of C1 catalysis in industrial level.

         <title>Modular, Scalable Total Synthesis of Lapparbin with a Noncanonical Biaryl Linkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization enabled total synthesis of the cyclic peptide natural product lapparbin. The key steps to construct the highly strained C&#8722;N biaryl linkage between the Tyr C6 and Trp N1&#8242; centers were found to be applicable to the synthesis of analogues of lapparbin.







Abstract
We report the development of a novel synthetic approach for the highly strained atrop&#8208;Tyr C&#8208;6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp N&#8208;1&#8242; linkage, which can be executed on a decagram scale using a modular strategy involving palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization. The first total synthesis of lapparbin (1) was achieved by applying this synthetic strategy. Furthermore, the modular synthesis utilizing C&#8722;H arylation and Larock macrocyclization, discovered in the total synthesis of lapparbin (1), was demonstrated to be applicable to various arbitrary biaryl linkages, including non&#8208;natural types.

         <dc:description>
MOFs having diverse components partitioned into unique domains may exhibit cooperative properties and functions reliant on domain composition and ordering. Inter&#8208;domain ligand exchange scrambles components across domains. This study provides strategies for mitigating ligand exchange and thus controlling domain compositional integrity, factors that are critical for building robust structure&#8211;property relationships in these classes of MOFs.







Abstract
Incorporating diverse components into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can expand their scope of properties and applications. Stratified MOFs (sMOFs) consist of compositionally unique concentric domains (strata), offering unprecedented complexity through partitioning of structural and functional components. However, the labile nature of metal&#8208;ligand coordination handicaps achieving compositionally distinct domains due to ligand exchange reactions occurring concurrently with secondary strata growth. To achieve complex sMOF compositions, characterizing and controlling the competing processes of new strata growth and ligand exchange are vital. This work systematically examines controlling ligand exchange in UiO&#8208;67 sMOFs by tuning ligand sterics. We present quantitative methods for assessing and visualizing the outcomes of strata growth and ligand exchange that rely on high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field images and elemental mapping via scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In addition, we leverage ligand sterics to create &#8216;blocking layers&#8217; that minimize ligand exchange between strata which are particularly susceptible to ligand exchange and inter&#8208;strata ligand mixing. Finally, we evaluate strata compositional integrity in various solvents and find that sMOFs can maintain their compositions for &gt;12&#8197;months in some cases. Collectively, these studies and methods enhance understanding and control over ligand placement in multi&#8208;domain MOFs, factors that underscore careful tunning of properties and function.

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Spinel Oxides via Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Phase Boundary Construction for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides requires comprehensive understanding of the surface reconstruction. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction is an electrochemical irreversible process, accompanied by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process as competitive reaction, which makes it difficult to solely study the surface reconstruction. Surface reconstruction has attracted significant scientific curiosity, and unveiling the elusive mechanism of structure&#8211;property relationship may offer the new design paradigm of advanced catalyst. In this work, we prepare CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 as model catalysts to investigate its reconstruction process. The results demonstrate that such a surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel oxides is a spontaneous chemical process, and phase boundary construction from tetrahedral to octahedral units is employed to decrease oxygen vacancy formation energy in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results show that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rises to 64&#8201;%, a 3.5&#8197;nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer generates on the catalyst surface after the reconstruction process, with a 158&#8197;mV decrease in overpotential. Furthermore, the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8722;T) phase will result in lattice mismatch, thus decreasing the oxygen vacancy formation energy and benefiting the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Then more active lattice oxygen combines with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;), followed by the soluble cation leaching, which eventually leads to promoted reconstruction. This work provides a new comprehending on the correlation between the intrinsic structure of the pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction process in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO&#8208;V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO&#8208;V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64&#8201;%, a 3.5&#8197;nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158&#8197;mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8722;T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non&#8208;bonding oxygen states and lowering EO&#8208;V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.

         <title>Redox and Kinetic Properties of Composition&#8208;Dependent Active Sites in Copper&#8208;Exchanged Chabazite for Direct Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity tests and advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques are employed to elucidate the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites with varying Cu loading and Si/Al ratio and its influence on CH4 partial oxidation to CH3OH. An improved CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency of materials containing primarily monomeric Cu(II) active sites in contrast to zeolites with a significant fraction of dimeric Cu(II) centers has been found.







Abstract
The CH4 oxidation performance of Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet&#8208;visible, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;O)]2+ moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven Dynamic Combinatorial Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) using a catalytic reaction cycle to form transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. Fueled by a chemical reaction, the library explores liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and advances DCC by engineering peptide structures, paving the way for tunable materials exhibiting emergent, life&#8208;like behaviors.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) creates libraries of molecules that are constantly interchanging in a dynamic combinatorial library. When a library member self&#8208;assembles, it can displace the equilibria, leading to emergent phenomena like its selection or even its replication. However, such dynamic combinatorial libraries typically operate in or close to equilibrium. This work introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry fueled by a catalytic reaction cycle that forms transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. The products in this library exist out of equilibrium at the expense of fuel and are thus regulated by kinetics and thermodynamics. By creating a chemically fueled dynamic combinatorial library with the vast structural space of amino acids, we explored the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behavior of the library members. The study advances DCCs by showing that peptide structures can be engineered to control the dynamic library&#8242;s behavior. The work paves the way for creating novel, tunable material systems that exhibit emergent behavior reminiscent of biological systems. These findings have implications for the development of new materials and for understanding life&#8242;s chemistry.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Assisted Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte is proposed by introducing weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran into commonly used propylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, which simultaneously achieves the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity. These merit the gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with accelerated desolvation process, guaranteeing the fast&#8208;charging performance of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure favors the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which endows fast ion transport and high strength modulus to enable improved electrochemical performance. However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast&#8208;charging performance.

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid ester-ether electrolyte is proposed by introducing weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran into commonly used propylene carbonate-based electrolyte, which simultaneously achieves the anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity. These merit the gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface with accelerated desolvation process, guaranteeing the fast-charging performance of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anion-reinforced solvation structure favors the formation of inorganic-rich robust electrode-electrolyte interface, which endows fast ion transport and high strength modulus to enable improved electrochemical performance. However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast-charging performance. Herein, a trade-off in tuning anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy-assisted hybrid ester-ether electrolyte. Anion-reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester-based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry-level 18650 cylindrical cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective S&#8208;Alkylation of Sulfenamides by Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 and an average yield of 94&#8201;% across a broad scope of inputs is achieved. Development of a catalyst to synthesize the opposite enantiomer with high selectivity and a demonstration of the utility of the method via application to the synthesis of a drug candidate is shown.







Abstract
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Essential to achieving high selectivity was the use of the triethylacetyl sulfenamide protecting group along with aqueous KOH as the base under biphasic aqueous conditions to enable the reaction to be performed at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. With these key parameters, enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 at the newly generated chiral sulfur center were achieved with an inexpensive cinchona alkaloid derived PTC. Broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility was observed for a variety of S&#8208;(hetero)aryl and branched and unbranched S&#8208;alkyl sulfenamides. Moreover, to achieve high selectivity for the opposite enantiomer, a pseudoenantiomeric catalyst was designed and synthesized from inexpensive cinchonidine. Given that sulfoximines are a bioactive pharmacophore of ever&#8208;increasing interest, selected product sulfilimines were oxidized to the corresponding sulfoximines with subsequent reductive cleavage affording the free&#8208;NH sulfoximines in high yields. The utility of the disclosed method was further demonstrated by the efficient asymmetric synthesis of atuveciclib, a phase I clinical candidate for which only chiral HPLC separation had previously been reported for isolation of the desired (R)&#8208;sulfoximine stereoisomer.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered vesicle microreactors with multiple functional proteins are constructed for bioenergy oscillation. Modulating biocatalytic reaction involved with each fuel (glucose, urea) generates and consumes protons respectively, which facilitates ATP synthesis and hydrolysis of ATPase in a tunable fashion.







Abstract
We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

         <title>Controlled Protein&#8208;Membrane Interactions Modulate Self&#8208;Organization of Min Protein Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organization of proteins is a fundamental process in living systems. The Zieske research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen now reconstituted snowflake&#8208;like patterns using purified proteins and synthetic lipid membranes. Their work reveals membrane linkage as a key biophysical parameter, determining whether proteins self&#8208;organize into expanding snowflake&#8208;like patterns or into travelling surface waves.







Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing protein patterns are crucial for living systems, governing important cellular processes such as polarization and division. While the field of protein self&#8208;organization has reached a point where basic pattern&#8208;forming mechanisms can be reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins, understanding how cells can dynamically switch and modulate these patterns, especially when transiently needed, remains an interesting frontier. Here, we demonstrate the efficient regulation of self&#8208;organizing protein patterns through the modulation of simple biophysical membrane parameters. Our investigation focuses on the impact of membrane affinity changes on Min protein patterns at lipid membranes composed of Escherichia coli lipids or minimal lipid compositions, and we present three major results. First, we observed the emergence of a diverse array of pattern phenotypes, ranging from waves over flower&#8208;shaped patterns to snowflake&#8208;like structures. Second, we demonstrated the dependency of these patterns on the density of protein&#8208;membrane linkers. Finally, we demonstrate that&#160;the shape of snowflake&#8208;like patterns is&#160;fine&#8208;tuned by membrane charge. Our results demonstrate the significant influence of membrane linkage as a straightforward biophysical parameter governing protein pattern formation. Our research points towards a simple yet intriguing mechanism by which cells can adeptly tune and switch protein patterns on the mesoscale.

         <title>Copper Intercalation Induces Amorphization of 2D Cu/WO3 for Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was achieved for a Cu intercalated, amorphous 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the magnetic enhancement of 2D Cu/WO3 is originated from oxygen lattice distortion induced by Cu intercalation, leading to the formation of bound magnetic polaron for ferromagnetism.







Abstract
Ferromagnetism in the two&#8208;dimensional limit has become an intriguing topic for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications. To induce ferromagnetism in 2D materials, intercalation has been proposed to be an effective strategy, which could introduce lattice distortion and unpaired spin into the material to modulate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. To strengthen the understanding of the magnetic origin of 2D material, Cu was introduced into a 2D WO3 through chemical intercalation in this work (2D Cu/WO3). In contrast to the diamagnetic nature of Cu and WO3, room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was characterized for 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the ferromagnetism to the bound magnetic polaron in 2D Cu/WO3, which is consist of unpaired spins from W5+/W4+ with localized carriers from oxygen vacancies. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to introduce ferromagnetism into diamagnetic WO3, which could be applied for a wider scope of 2D materials.

Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the magnetic enhancement of 2D Cu/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is originated from oxygen lattice distortion induced by Cu intercalation, leading to the formation of bound magnetic polaron for ferromagnetism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional limit has become an intriguing topic for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications. To induce ferromagnetism in 2D materials, intercalation has been proposed to be an effective strategy, which could introduce lattice distortion and unpaired spin into the material to modulate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. To strengthen the understanding of the magnetic origin of 2D material, Cu was introduced into a 2D WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through chemical intercalation in this work (2D Cu/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). In contrast to the diamagnetic nature of Cu and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, room-temperature ferromagnetism was characterized for 2D Cu/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the ferromagnetism to the bound magnetic polaron in 2D Cu/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is consist of unpaired spins from W&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;/W&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; with localized carriers from oxygen vacancies. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to introduce ferromagnetism into diamagnetic WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which could be applied for a wider scope of 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methoxide&#8208;Enabled Zirconium&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the zirconium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes is presented that allows the direct use of zirconocene dichloride as catalyst through mild activation with a methoxide additive. The reaction can be applied to terminal, internal, and conjugated alkenes. A catalytic zirconium walk ensures the selective formation of linear silane products. Based on additional experiments and calculations, a zirconium(IV) mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A zirconocene dichloride&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation is reported that can be applied to non&#8208;activated and conjugated terminal and internal alkenes. It involves a catalytic Zr&#8208;walk process and leads to a selective conversion to the linear product. Lithium methoxide serves as mild catalyst activating agent, which significantly increases the applicability and operational simplicity in comparison to earlier zirconium(II)&#8208;based protocols. Supported by additional experiments and calculations, a mechanism via zirconium(IV) intermediates is proposed. Due to the benign nature and ready&#8208;availability of the zirconium catalyst, the reaction is an attractive alternative to established alkene hydrosilylation methods.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 Sites Coupling Atop&#8208;type and Bridge&#8208;type Adsorbed *C1 for Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 site leads to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure and the regulation of adsorption strength of several key adsorbates, reaching the simultaneous atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion.







Abstract
2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8722;O4 or M&#8722;N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8722;N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT&#8208;119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT&#8208;119 could reach a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8722;O4 units, asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 units lead to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion. This work broadens the feasible C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.

         <dc:description>
Progress in the development of non&#8208;alternant nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs, including N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon (5&#8211;7)&#8197;pairs, N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon (5&#8211;8)&#8197;pairs and N&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;heptagon (7&#8211;7)&#8197;pairs, is comprehensively covered&#160;in this review. The synthesis, structure analysis, and photophysical properties have been highlighted to shed light on the structure&#8211;property relationships and to realize emerging applications for organic optoelectronics.







Abstract
Introduction of non&#8208;hexagons and/or heteroatoms allows for finely tuning the physicochemical properties of nanographenes. Heteroatoms doping have dominated the modulation of nanographenes with tunable band gap, rich electrochemical activities and so on. The pair of non&#8208;hexagons, for instance, pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs, have furnished nanographenes with aromatic and/or antiaromatic characteristics, open&#8208;shell properties and so on. In order to meet the growing demand for versatile nanographenes in materials science, research on novel nanographenes with heteroatom doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs has been aroused in recent years. In this review, we focus on nanographenes with nitrogen&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal paris including the synthesis, structure analysis, photophysical properties, and potential applications in organic devices.

         <title>Unbiased Photoelectrochemical H2O2 Coupled to H2 Production via Dual Sb2S3&#8208;Based Photoelectrodes with Ultralow Onset Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial photosynthesis with a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 and a photocathode of H2 by one sun illumination as the only energy input was developed on Sb2S3 photoelectrodes.







Abstract
The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. Moreover, the formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an outstanding average FE of 85&#8201;% in the potential range of 0.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 at 1.6&#8197;VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8211;0.55&#8197;VRHE with 80.4&#8201;% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both the Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3 photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 without applying any addition bias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based photoelectrodes exhibit H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; two-side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value-added products in neutral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

         <title>Transforming Element Sulfur to High Performance Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Polymer via Proton Transfer Enabled Anionic Hybrid Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of sulfur has been a global issue. Copolymerization of element sulfur (S8) with other monomers is a promising route to convert it to useful materials but is limited by the comonomers. Here, we report anionic hybrid copolymerization of S8 with acrylate and epoxide at room temperature, where S8 does not copolymerize with epoxide in the absence of acrylate. Yet, the proton transfer from the methyne in acrylate to the oxygen anion enables the ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic comonomer and hence the copolymerization. The cyclic comonomers can be expanded to lactone and cyclic carbonate. Specifically, the copolymer of S8 with bisphenl A diglycidyl ether and diacrylate displays mechanical properties comparable to those of most common plastics, namely, it has ultimate tensile strength as high as 60.8 MPa and Young&#8217;s modulus up to 680 MPa. It also exhibits high UV resistance and good transparency. Particularly, it has excellent UV&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, reprocessability and closed&#8208;loop recyclability due to the abundant dynamic S&#8208;S bonds and ester groups. This study provides an efficient strategy to turn element sulfur into closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymer with high mechanical and optical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Overall 99&#8201;% (002) Plane Achieves Extreme and Direct Utilization of 95&#8201;% Zn Anode and By&#8208;Product as Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized (002) Zn anodes with an ultra&#8208;high RTC of 99&#8201;% are fabricated on non&#8208;textured substrates by the synergistic action of Mn3+ and H+ via a constant voltage electrodeposition strategy. The anode is capable of stable operation at ultra&#8208;high current densities &amp; areal capacities. Additionally, MnO2, a by&#8208;product of the 99&#8201;% RTC Zn (002) electrodeposition, can be used directly as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life cathode.







Abstract
Zn anode protection in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) face great challenges of high Zn utilization rate (i.e., depth of discharge, DOD) and high current density due to the large difficulty in obtaining an extreme overall RTC (relative texture coefficient) of Zn (002) plane. Through the potent interaction of Mn(III)aq and H+ with distinct Zn crystal planes under an electric field, large&#8208;size Zn foils with a breakthrough (002) plane RTC of 99&#8201;% (i.e., close to Zn single crystal) are electrodeposited on texture&#8208;less substrates, which is also applicable from recycled Zn. The ultra&#8208;high (002) plane RTC remarkably enhances cyclic performance of the Zn anode (70&#8201;% DOD @ 45.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the DOD is even up to 95&#8201;% (@ 28.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with an electrolyte additive of polyaniline. Furthermore, MnO2, the by&#8208;product of electrodeposition, is directly used as cathode of both coin cell and pouch battery, surpassing the cyclic performance exhibited by the majority of Zn||MnO2 batteries in previous instances. These results demonstrate the great potential of our strategy for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale ZIBs.

         <title>Regulating Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphasial Reactions by Zwitterionic Binder Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes and Silicon&#8208;Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic binder is designed to achieve an anion&#8208;enriched solvation environment on Si&#8208;based anodes with weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Such binder&#8208;regulated SEI is effective in minimizing the catalytic decomposition of the electrolyte and Si devitalization, thus enabling long&#8208;life full cells with Si&#8208;graphite anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes.







Abstract
The practical application of silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes faces challenges due to severe structural and interphasial degradations. These challenges are exacerbated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing Si&#8208;based anodes with high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes, as significant transition&#8208;metal crossover catalyzes serious parasitic side reactions, leading to faster cell failure. While enhancing the mechanical properties of polymer binders has been acknowledged as an effective means of improving solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability on Si&#8208;based anodes, an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the binder chemistry influences the SEI is lacking. Herein, a zwitterionic binder with an ability to manipulate the chemical composition and spatial distribution of the SEI layer is designed for Si&#8208;based anodes. It is evidenced that the electrically charged microenvironment created by the zwitterionic species alters the solvation environment on the Si&#8208;based anode, featuring rich anions and weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. Such a binder&#8208;regulated solvation environment induces a thin, uniform, robust SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes, which is found to be the key to withstanding transition&#8208;metal deposition and minimizing their detrimental impact on catalyzing electrolyte decomposition and devitalizing bulk Si. As a result, albeit possessing comparable mechanical properties to those of commercial binders, the zwitterionic binder enables superior cycling performances in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs under demanding operating conditions.

         <title>Strengthening an Intramolecular Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond to Get in Shape for Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) are not considered strong interactions, they can profoundly affect molecular interactions. One prominent example is the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx. When the CH3 group of l&#8208;fucose is replaced by CF3, the intramolecular non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond approaches the strength of a classical H&#8208;bond. Thus, although currently underestimated, non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds should find a place in the toolbox for structural design.







Abstract
In this research article, we report on the strengthening of a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) by introducing electron withdrawing groups at the carbon atom. The approach is demonstrated on the example of derivatives of the physiological E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx (1, sLex). Its affinity is mainly due to a beneficial entropy term, which is predominantly caused by the pre&#8208;organization of sLex in its binding conformation. We have shown, that among the elements responsible for the pre&#8208;organization, the stabilization by a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond between the H&#8722;C5 of l&#8208;fucose and the ring oxygen O5 of the neighboring d&#8208;galactose moiety is essential and yields 7.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This effect could be further strengthened by replacing l&#8208;fucose by 6,6,6&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;l&#8208;fucose leading to an improved non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond of 14.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, i.e., an improved pre&#8208;organization in the bioactive conformation. For a series of glycomimetics of sLex (1), this outcome could be confirmed by high field NMR&#8208;shifts of the H&#8722;C5Fuc, by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of glycomimetics co&#8208;crystallized with E&#8208;selectin as well as by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the CF3&#8208;group beneficially influences the pharmacokinetic properties of sLex mimetics. Thus, acid&#8208;stability, a prerequisite for gastrointestinal stability, could be substantially improved.

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed sequential asymmetric hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs has been developed, providing a robust approach to chiral silacyclopentane featuring consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent stereocontrol. Mechanistic studies disclosed that this reaction undergoes a sequential intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant homoallylic silanes.







Abstract
Despite impressive advances in the construction of enantioenriched silacarbocycles featuring silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers via a selection of well&#8208;defined sila&#8208;synthons, the development of a more convenient and economic method with readily available starting materials is significantly less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first example of copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation of readily accessible methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) and primary silanes, affording an efficient and convenient route to a wide range of chiral silacyclopentanes bearing consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &#8805;98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions combine copper&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant Z/E mixture of homoallylic silanes.

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Helix&#8208;Sense&#8208;Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one&#8208;handed helicity&#8208;memorized polymers. The carboxy&#8208;bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co&#8208;assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry.

     alt="Helix-Sense-Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helix-sense-selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one-handed helicity-memorized polymers. The carboxy-bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co-assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the helix-sense-selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix-sense-selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one-handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one-pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy-bound helicity-memorized polymer self-assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co-assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;canonical Tryptophan Variants via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H Functionalization of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tryptophan and its non&#8208;canonical variants play critical roles in pharmaceutical molecules and enzymes. Facile access to this privileged class of amino acids from readily available building blocks remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a regioselective synthesis of non&#8208;canonical tryptophans bearing C4&#8208;C7 substituents via Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation between structurally diverse tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)&#8208;protected anilines and alkynyl chlorides readily prepared from amino acid building blocks. This transformation harnesses Boc&#8208;directed C&#8211;H metalation and demetalation to afford a wide range of C2&#8208;unsubstituted indole products in a redox&#8208;neutral fashion. This umpolung approach compared to the classic Larock indole synthesis offers a novel mechanism for heteroarene annulation and will be useful for the synthesis of natural products and drug molecules containing non&#8208;canonical tryptophan residues in a highly regioselective manner.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Catalysis for Isoindolinone Synthesis over Single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an efficient strategy to replace the conventional synthesis method for producing isoindolinone (IIO) scaffold, a crucial structural motif for constructing pharmaceutical molecules, remains to be a great challenge. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 tandem catalysis has been developed for the IIO scaffold synthesis by using readily available phthalic anhydride (PA), ammonia, and H2. The single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving a PA conversion of 99%, an IIO selectivity of 91%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4807 h&#8208;1. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the tandem catalysis between TiO2 support and single&#8208;atom Pd. The TiO2 efficiently catalyzes the conversion of PA with ammonia to form phthalimide (PAM), subsequently transformed into IIO over TiO2 through the reaction of PAM with NH3 and the spillover hydrogen species derived from single&#8208;atom Pd. Notably, NH3 functions not only as a reactant but also as a promoter to accelerate the reduction of amides combined with the Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This tandem catalysis of a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of the crucial IIO platform molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction Polymerization of CO2 with Phenylene Silanes Cata&#8208;lyzed by Single Component B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 is an abundant C1 resource but a green&#8208;house gas and chemically inert. Thus, its utilization has been a promising but challenging project. Herein, we report the unprecedented polymerization of CO2 and C6H4(SiMe2H)2 using B(C6F5)3 alone under mild conditions to give poly(silphenylene siloxane) accompanied by releasing CH4. The copolymerization can be extended to comonomers of phenylene silanes bearing functional groups. Moreover, it combines with Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction to establish a tandem polymerization system to achieve super thermal resistant poly(siloxane&#8208;co&#8208;silphenylene siloxane)s. Density functional theory reveals that B(C6F5)3 is activated by silanes to form free HB(C6F5)2, which is the true active species for CO2 reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH4 and the step&#8208;growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C6F5)3 and HB(C6F5)2, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO2 to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Structural Phase Transitions in Zero&#8208;dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;Based Metal Halides for Dynamically Tunable Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring structural phase transitions and luminescence mechanisms in Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides poses significant challenges, that are crucial for unlocking the full potential of tunable optical properties and diversifying their functional capabilities. Herein, we have designed two inter&#8208;transformable 0D Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides, namely (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6, through distinct synthesis conditions utilizing identical reactants. Their optical properties and luminescence mechanisms were systematically elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. The bright cyan&#8208;fluorescent (C19H18P)2CuI3 with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 77% is attributed to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Differently, the broad yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence of (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 displays a remarkable PLQY of 83%. Its luminescence mechanism is mainly attributed to the combined effects of metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer and cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer, which effects stem from the strong Cu&#8208;Cu bonding interactions in the (Cu4I6)2&#8208; clusters. Moreover, (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 exhibit reversible structural phase transitions. The elucidation of the phase transitions mechanism has paved the way for an unforgeable anti&#8208;counterfeiting system. This system dynamically shifts between cyan and yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence, triggered by the phase transitions, bolstering security and authenticity. This work enriches the luminescence theory of 0D metal halides, offering novel strategies for optical property modulation and fostering optical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Skeletal Rearrangement of Non&#8208;Biased Alkyl Cyclopropanes/butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capitalizing the inherent strain energy within molecules, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions have been widely employed in organic synthesis. Small cycloalkanes like cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, with their moderate ring strain, typically require dense functionalization to induce bias or distal activation of (hetero)aromatic rings via single&#8208;electron oxidation for relieving the tension. In this study, we present a pioneering direct activation of alkyl cyclopropanes/butanes through electrochemical oxidation. This approach not only showcases the potential for ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane/butane under electrochemical conditions but also streamlines the synthesis of diverse oxazolines and oxazines. The applicability of our method is exemplified by its broad substrate scopes. Notably, the products derived from cyclobutanes undergo a formal ring contraction to cyclopropanes, introducing an intriguing aspect to our discoveries. These discoveries mark a significant advancement in strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven skeletal rearrangement reactions of moderately strained rings, offering sustainable and efficient synthetic pathways for future endeavours.</dc:description>
