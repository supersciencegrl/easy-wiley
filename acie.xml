         <title>Binding Energy&#8208;Assisted Oxidation Potential as a Measure of Prelithiation Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;ion desolvation was proved the rate&#8208;determining step of the solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation, while the solution structures affect the capability of prelithiation in the electrode material. The impacts of the structures of the solute and solvent in the lithium&#8208;aromatic compound complex solution (LACS) were clarified on the binding energy (BE) and the oxidation potential (EO) of the solution. We proposed to apply the BE&#8208;assisted EO as a measure of prelithiation capability of LACS.








Abstract
The solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation of electrode materials is an effective approach to elevate the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and energy&#8208;density of the Li&#8208;ion battery. Although various lithium&#8208;aromatic compound complex solutions (LACSs) have been reported as prelithiation reagents, fundamental understandings are still lacking regarding their drastic difference in prelithiation behavior. In this work, the rate&#8208;determining step and some key factors that affect the prelithiation capability were recognized via electrochemical evaluation, spectroscopic analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Considering the inherent correlations between the potential of electrochemical Li+&#8208;extraction from LACS upon cyclic voltammetry (the oxidation potential of LACS, EO), the calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, the binding energy (BE) of the solvated Li&#8208;ions to the solution (BEsolution), and the prediction accuracy of prelithiation capability and calculations efficiency, we proposed BE&#8208;assisted EO as a descriptor for its prelithiation feasibility. This strategy will provide important guidance for the rapid selection and rational design of LACSs for efficient chemical prelithiation.

         <title>Tunable Charge Transport Properties Through Precise &#960;&#8208;Stacking Modulation in Isostructural Porous Molecular Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationship in through&#8208;space conductive MOFs is investigated using a series of counterion&#8208;free porous molecular conductors (PMC&#8208;3) with carrier&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;stacked columns. The constant carrier density and halide&#8208;dependent tunable &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry in PMC&#8208;3 enable the discovery of a linear correlation between the lattice parameter along the &#960;&#8208;stacking direction and charge transport properties.








Abstract
Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships in electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for their rational design toward practical applications. Since single crystals of MOFs with through&#8208;space conductive &#960;&#8208;stacked columnar structures are relatively easy to obtain, their structures can be determined with high accuracy. However, elucidating those structure&#8211;property relationships without interference from carrier scattering and variations in carrier concentration remains challenging. Herein, we synthesized three isostructural porous molecular conductors (denoted as PMC&#8208;3) via electrocrystallization using a redox&#8208;active N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (NDI&#8208;py) ligand and ZnX2 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Single crystals of PMC&#8208;3 exhibit high electrical conductivity (&#8764;10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1), comparable to the highest values reported for NDI&#8208;based crystalline materials. Moreover, PMC&#8208;3 serves as a model system for probing structure&#8211;property relationships in through&#8208;space conductive MOFs, offering three key advantages. First, the absence of counterions, eliminating carrier scattering; second, identical carrier concentrations across the series, allowing isolation of the effects of &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry on transport properties; and third, tunable &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries via halide ligand substitution. As a result, a linear correlation between the lattice parameter along the stacking axis and intrinsic charge transport properties is revealed, representing a significant advance in understanding charge transport in through&#8208;space conductive MOFs.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Reaction Discovery in Porous Materials Using Periodic Nanoreactor Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic ab initio nanoreactor molecular dynamics is used to agnostically investigate the reaction network of selective catalytic reduction converting nitrogen oxide via copper&#8208;exchanged chabazite zeolites. Autonomous reaction discovery revealed established as well as previously unreported pathways, including a water&#8208;assisted N2 formation and a novel radical&#8208;driven route to N2O. Free energy barriers were computed for the explored mechanism including phononic contributions. More in the Research Article (e14074), Jan Meisner and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Possible Peierls Distortion Through Re2 Dimer Formation in the LaNiO2&#8208;Type Nitrides LnReN2 (Ln = Pr, Nd)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the high&#8208;pressure synthesis of two new anion&#8208;vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite&#8208;related nitrides, PrReN2 and NdReN2, featuring distorted LaNiO2&#8208;type structures. X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction reveal a structural distortion driven by dimerization of Re&#8208;chains, while electronic structure calculations reveal the simultaneous presence of nitridometallate anions and an intermetallic framework. Magnetic properties were studied with neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements, which reveal an antiferromagnetic ordering of Nd3+ moments in NdReN2 at 15.5 K.








Abstract
Nitride perovskites are a recently opened class of materials with a limited number of stable compounds. Notably, anion&#8208;vacancy&#8208;ordered materials such as LaNiO2&#8208;type nitrides are rare despite useful properties such as superconductivity reported for analogous oxides. Here, we report the preparation of two LnReN2 (Ln&#160;=&#160;Pr, Nd) materials with a distorted LaNiO2&#8208;type structure at high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature conditions of a large volume press. Powder X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction show that the orthorhombic distortion (o&#8208;LnReN2) of the LaNiO2&#8208;aristotype structure is caused by buckling of the ReN4/2 layers through Re dimerization. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the o&#8208;LnReN2 materials are composed of classic nitridometallate anions and a cationic intermetallic framework. Moreover, the calculations reveal the driving force of the Re dimerization likely to be from an electronic instability related to a Peierls&#8208;type distortion. We further characterize the magnetic ground state of both materials with magnetization measurements as well as magnetic neutron scattering uncovering a long&#8208;range antiferromagnetic order of Nd3+ moments in NdReN2 at TN&#160;=&#160;15.5&#160;K. The stability of the compounds is investigated by temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction showing decomposition of NdReN2 at ca. 750 &#176;C. The o&#8208;LnReN2 materials represent a curious class of nitrides at the border of classic nitridometallates, intermetallics, and low&#8208;dimensional complex chemistry.

         <title>An Energetic S0/S+ Redox Chemistry for Aqueous and Nonaqueous Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed S0/S+ redox chemistry exhibits distinct advantages over the traditional S0/S2&#8722; couple in both nonaqueous and aqueous batteries. Its intrinsically high electrode potential and high conversion efficiency enable the construction of high&#8211;energy density sulfur batteries, while simultaneously avoiding polysulfide shuttling and the sluggish reaction kinetics that typically limit S0/S2&#8722; systems.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based batteries are primarily driven by the S0/S2&#8722; redox chemistry, yet their performance is limited by sluggish kinetics and low practical energy densities. In aqueous systems, slow solid&#8208;solid conversion leads to high overpotentials (&#8764;1&#160;V) that restricts energy efficiency, while in nonaqueous systems, the sophisticated dissolution&#8208;precipitation mechanism involving soluble polysulfide intermediates induces shuttle effects and capacity loss, necessitating catholyte configurations that compromise energy density. Here, we report an energetic and reversible S0/S+ redox couple enabled by the formation of liquid&#8208;phase S2Br2 in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. Compared to traditional S0/S2&#8722; reactions (0.45&#160;V vs. Zn2+/Zn; 2.2&#160;V vs. Li+/Li), the S0/S+ redox chemistry offers significantly higher equilibrium redox potentials (1.68&#160;V vs. Zn2+/Zn; 3.4&#160;V vs. Li+/Li), a direct one&#8208;step conversion pathway that avoids polysulfide intermediates formation, and intrinsically faster kinetics attributed to its solid&#8208;liquid transition nature, enabling full sulfur utilization with a capacity of 837&#160;mAh g&#8722;1. When paired with Zn or Li anodes in tailored aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively, this chemistry delivers high energy densities of 1406 and 2689&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on sulfur mass (402 and 768&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on S2Br2 mass) and demonstrating strong potential for high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Fibril Structure of Desiccation&#8208;Protective Tardigrade Protein CAHS&#8208;8</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the atomic structure of the fibril formed by an intrinsically disordered protein that has been shown to be responsible for remarkable environmental stress in tardigrades. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a unique mechanism of fibril assembly whereby a single helix forms a stable, antiparallel coiled&#8208;coil dimer, which then assembles into a single continuous fibril via a second coiled&#8208;coil interface on the opposing face of the helix.








Abstract
Cytosolic Abundant Heat&#8208;Soluble (CAHS) proteins are thought to be responsible for protection of tardigrades against conditions of extreme environmental stress, in particular desiccation. Hypsibius exemplaris CAHS&#8208;8 is intrinsically disordered in solution, undergoing conformational transformation as a function of stress, assembling into fibres that form a hydrogel. Here we present the crystal structure of the fibrils of CAHS&#8208;8, comprising a single 101 residue&#8208;long helix, forming an atypical 90 amino&#8208;acid coiled&#8208;coil dimer exhibiting non&#8208;canonical periodicities and assembling into fibrils via a second coiled coil interface associating adjacent dimers via the opposing face of the helix. Combination with electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and disorder modelling provides structural insight into the details of this assembly that is essential for cell survival. Individual fibrils appear to interact in a pairwise manner, possibly via their intrinsically disordered tails, forming straight fibres.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Selective Temperature&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Thiophene Derivatives at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition of a dithiophene derivative on Ag(111) at room temperature followed by annealing gives rise to molecular wires, whereas the adsorption of the same precursor on a hot substrate affords the formation of benzotrithiophene species.








Abstract
The temperature&#8208;controlled transformation of organic molecules at interfaces is an incipient yet powerful strategy for tailoring their structural and physico&#8208;chemical properties. In this study, we investigate the substrate&#8208; and thermal&#8208;selective reactions of bis(3,4&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fused)tetrabromo&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinodimethane molecule (1), focusing on its behavior at distinct coinage metal interfaces, namely Au(111) and Ag(111). Combining scanning probe microscopy and theory, we demonstrate that its sequential transformations are highly dependent on the substrate material and the specific reaction temperatures. When a benzodithiophene precursor, endowed with&#160;=&#160;CBr2 units, is deposited under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions on both substrates held at room temperature (RT), or annealed to 100&#160;&#176;C in the case of Au(111), a self&#8208;assembly is formed comprising 1D covalent polymers achieved through debromination and homocoupling, which are aligned in a parallel fashion thanks to supramolecular interactions, giving rise to a 2D supramolecular polymer. However, when the substrate is held at or above 175&#160;&#176;C during deposition, the molecular precursors (1) undergo substrate&#8208;specific intramolecular reactions. On Au(111), a major transformation into pentalenodithiophene species is observed, concomitant with the formation of benzotrithiophene. On Ag(111), instead, pentalenodithiophene species are precluded. These findings highlight the importance of substrate selection and temperature control in enabling precise molecular transformations at the nanoscale.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Flexocatalytic Tumor Suppression Enabled by SrTiO3 Nanoflexocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The centrosymmetric SrTiO3 nanoflexocatalysts undergo periodic deformation upon ultrasound irradiation, enabling efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. This process leads to a robust built&#8208;in electric field that drives substantial surface charge accumulation, which synergistically enhances the production of reactive oxygen species. The resulting sono&#8208;flexocatalytic therapy potently suppresses tumor growth through ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite piezocatalytic tumor therapy offers a promising non&#8208;invasive modality for disease treatment, its application is fundamentally limited by the requirement for non&#8208;centrosymmetric piezocatalysts. To solve this critical issue, we present a novel &#8220;sono&#8208;flexocatalytic therapy&#8221; (SFT) strategy using centrosymmetric strontium titanate (SrTiO3) nanocatalysts. Under ultrasound irradiation, SrTiO3 generates significant flexoelectric polarization due to the induced strain gradients, effectively separating charges. This drives robust redox reactions on the nanocatalyst surfaces, producing abundant cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions within tumor cells. The resultant ROS surge induces severe oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately apoptosis, effectively suppressing tumor growth as validated by both in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, theoretical simulations elucidate the specific strain&#8208;gradient dependent sono&#8208;flexocatalytic mechanism. This work pioneers sono&#8208;flexocatalytic tumor therapy by leveraging ultrasound&#8208;triggered flexoelectricity in SrTiO3 nanocatalysts, thereby not only introducing centrosymmetric biomaterials into sonocatalytic treatments but also establishing a new paradigm for pancatalytic medicine with broad material applicability.

         <title>Efficient Ethanol Dehydrogenation to Acetaldehyde and H2 via Synergistic Thermocatalysis and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we design a bifunctional catalytic layer comprising Ru/C and PdAu/C within a high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. This architecture synergistically combines thermocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation (EDHR) with electrochemical hydrogen oxidation (HOR), allowing the Ru/C component to drive ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;acetaldehyde conversion while PdAu/C rapidly oxidizes residual acetaldehyde intermediates in the catalytic layer to acetic acid. This process shifts the reaction equilibrium toward sustained dehydrogenation.








Abstract
The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and H2 represents an attractive synthetic route, owing to the versatile applications of acetaldehyde and the high atom economy. In this work, efficient ethanol dehydrogenation was achieved at the anode of a high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer by integrating thermocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation (EDHR) with electrochemical hydrogen oxidation (HOR) over Ru/C and PdAu/C composite catalytic layer. The Ru/C serves as a bifunctional catalyst for the EDHR and HOR, and the PdAu/C could rapidly electrooxidize retained acetaldehyde of the catalyst layer into acetic acid, thereby effectively promoting the dehydrogenation of ethanol. Under the conditions of 200 &#176;C and 0.6&#160;V, this reaction enabled high production rates of acetaldehyde (1479&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 99.06% selectivity) at the anode and H2 (1728&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) at the cathode, substantially outperforming traditional thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. This work provides a novel strategy for efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and facilitates the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added products.

     alt="Efficient Ethanol Dehydrogenation to Acetaldehyde and H2 via Synergistic Thermocatalysis and Electrocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we design a bifunctional catalytic layer comprising Ru/C and PdAu/C within a high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. This architecture synergistically combines thermocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation (EDHR) with electrochemical hydrogen oxidation (HOR), allowing the Ru/C component to drive ethanol-to-acetaldehyde conversion while PdAu/C rapidly oxidizes residual acetaldehyde intermediates in the catalytic layer to acetic acid. This process shifts the reaction equilibrium toward sustained dehydrogenation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents an attractive synthetic route, owing to the versatile applications of acetaldehyde and the high atom economy. In this work, efficient ethanol dehydrogenation was achieved at the anode of a high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer by integrating thermocatalytic ethanol dehydrogenation (EDHR) with electrochemical hydrogen oxidation (HOR) over Ru/C and PdAu/C composite catalytic layer. The Ru/C serves as a bifunctional catalyst for the EDHR and HOR, and the PdAu/C could rapidly electrooxidize retained acetaldehyde of the catalyst layer into acetic acid, thereby effectively promoting the dehydrogenation of ethanol. Under the conditions of 200 &#176;C and 0.6&#160;V, this reaction enabled high production rates of acetaldehyde (1479&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 99.06% selectivity) at the anode and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1728&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at the cathode, substantially outperforming traditional thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. This work provides a novel strategy for efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and facilitates the sustainable synthesis of value-added products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In the Research Article (e20335), Chenjiang Liu, Yonghong Zhang, and co&#8208;workers successfully achieved a green electrochemical controllable divergent carboxylation of phenylacetylene with carbon dioxide, efficiently affording a variety of value&#8208;added phenylpropiolic acids, cinnamic acids, fumaric acids, and succinic acids under mild condition with good selectivity. This not only provides an efficient strategy for electrochemically driven fixation of wasted greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and high&#8208;value&#8208;added transformation of low&#8208;cost bulk chemicals alkynes, but also convert the clean energy of wind and solar into chemical energy.

In the Communication (e18517), Andr&#233; K. Eckhardt and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the advantageous properties of solid para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) matrices for electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy by investigating the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical and an in situ generated P&#8208;centered mono&#8208;radical. The spectral resolution of the P&#8208;centered radical in p&#8208;H2 is roughly enhanced by a factor of three compared to argon.

         <title>Self&#8208;Discharge Behaviors in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous batteries (ABs) offer unmatched safety and cost&#8208;efficiency for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, yet self&#8208;discharge, a spontaneous energy loss during idle states, compromises their viability. This review decodes self&#8208;discharge mechanisms, standardizes testing protocols, and proposes targeted mitigation strategies. By bridging fundamental insights with practical guidelines, this review attempts to accelerate ABs&#8217; path to commercialization. 








Abstract
Aqueous batteries (ABs) are considered emerging candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental compatibility. In recent years, major advances have been made in ABs toward improving their energy density and cycling stability, and progressing their prospects for real application. However, self&#8208;discharge, a critical parameter for practical applications, remains largely underexplored. Many studies either overlook this aspect entirely or employ inconsistent testing protocols, making cross&#8208;system comparisons difficult and diminishing the reliability of reported data. To date, no comprehensive review that systematically addresses self&#8208;discharge in ABs is available. In this review, we aim to fill this gap by providing an in&#8208;depth analysis of self&#8208;discharge phenomena in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ABs. We first summarize the underlying mechanisms responsible for self&#8208;discharge and then critically evaluate current measurement approaches, offering recommendations for practical and standardized testing protocols. Furthermore, we highlight mitigation strategies from both electrolyte and electrode perspectives, providing a materials&#8208;oriented overview of self&#8208;discharge suppression. This review not only offers a theoretical framework for understanding self&#8208;discharge behaviors in ABs, but also proposes clear guidelines for future experimental assessment, thereby enhancing their practical relevance and accelerating their development toward commercialization.

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanism of&#160;Photocatalytic CO2 Cycloaddition over Linker&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isoreticular Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;F, H, and Me) are fabricated with regulated linker excitation energy and defect&#8208;mediated linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer barrier. Among them, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H achieves the optimal energetic balance, delivering the highest photocatalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides. In&#8208;situ studies reveal that the [Br&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;TBA+]&#8764;CO2 adduct facilitates electron transfer and lowers the energy requirement for CO2&#8226;&#8722; formation, thereby promoting CO2 fixation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition represents a promising route for solar&#8208;driven synthesis of value&#8208;added C2+ chemicals and simultaneously mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the pivotal step of direct one&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO2&#8226;&#8722; requires a very high reduction potential of &#8722;1.9&#160;V versus NHE, posing a formidable challenge. In this study, cerium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with linker&#8208;induced defects, specifically Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;Me, H, and F), are investigated to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition. Among them, Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H, which strikes an optimal balance between light absorption and charge separation, demonstrates superior catalytic performance (yield&#160;&gt; 90%) when coupled with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co&#8208;catalyst. In&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that TBAB stabilizes CO2 through the formation of [Br&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;TBA+]&#8764;CO2 adducts, which lowers the thermodynamic energy requirement for CO2&#8226;&#8722; generation from 0.66&#160;eV (in the direct CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO2&#8226;&#8722; route) to &#8722;0.90&#160;eV. This potential modulation promotes efficient photoelectron transfer from the MOFs to CO2, substantially enhancing the overall cycloaddition efficiency.

In-situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that TBAB stabilizes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the formation of [Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;TBA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&#8764;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adducts, which lowers the thermodynamic energy requirement for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generation from 0.66&#160;eV (in the direct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; route) to &#8722;0.90&#160;eV. This potential modulation promotes efficient photoelectron transfer from the MOFs to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, substantially enhancing the overall cycloaddition efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Asymmetric Lithium Salts with Multi&#8208;Functional Capabilities for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed asymmetric lithium salt, LiDMTFSI, features an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino group that creates a &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; effect to modulate solvation chemistry. This design enables high LiNO3 solubility and an anion&#8208;rich solvation sheath, resulting in a robust inorganic SEI, high Li+ transference number, and suppressed Al corrosion for stable high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face severe interfacial instability in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, where solvent&#8208;centric solvation structures drive the formation of fragile, organic&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphases (SEIs). However, existing strategies mainly rely on solvent engineering, whereas lithium salt design remains underexplored. Herein, we design an asymmetric lithium salt, lithium (N, N&#8208;dimethylsulfamoyl) (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiDMTFSI), featuring an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino group that enhances the anion's nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity. By introducing a push&#8208;pull effect on the anionic charge, LiDMTFSI shifts the solvation structure from solvent&#8208;rich to anion&#8208;rich, thereby facilitating the co&#8208;dissolution of beneficial lithium salt. The resulting solvent&#8208;deficient solvation sheath governs the interphasial chemistry to favor the formation of a compact inorganic&#8208;rich SEI (e.g., LiF, Li2O, Li3N, Li2S, and other beneficial components) with excellent mechanical integrity and interfacial ion transport, enabling uniform Li deposition and mitigating parasitic side&#8208;reactions. A high Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.1% was achieved in dilute carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, and full cells with ultrathin Li anodes and high&#8208;loading NMC811 cathodes demonstrated consistent operation for over 120 cycles with 83% capacity retention at a high voltage of 4.3&#160;V. These findings underscore the potential of anion molecular design as a powerful strategy for interphasial engineering in high&#8208;energy LMBs.

         <title>Seamlessly Overcoming Biological Barriers with a Small Photosensitizer to Treat Metastatic Tumors with Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LUZ 51 is a relatively small and amphiphilic photosensitizer that accumulates in poorly&#8208;vascularized tumors, is rapidly internalized by cancer cells, does not elicit skin photosensitivity and triggers robust immunological responses that reduce spontaneous metastasis.








Abstract
A breakthrough in the treatment of solid tumors requires primary tumor ablation and remission of metastasis. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may meet these requirements, but current photosensitizers poorly infiltrate dense tumors and insufficiently stimulate the immune system. We introduce LUZ51, a small bacteriochlorin that features strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, high photostability, moderate lipophilicity, amphiphilicity, and appropriate singlet oxygen quantum yield. LUZ51 has a fast cellular uptake via passive diffusion and EC50s of 5&#8211;15&#160;nM range for a light dose of 1&#160;J/cm2. It seamlessly crosses biological barriers and accumulates in tumors. Mice with CT26 tumors cured in one treatment (0.15&#160;mg/kg and 20&#160;J/cm2) resisted tumor rechallenge. Treatment of mice with 5&#160;mm orthotopic 4T1 tumors enabled cures, with the associated inhibition of metastasis. The blood half&#8208;life is 82&#160;min and no skin photosensitivity was detected. Small&#8208;size LUZ51 enables tissue&#8208;agnostic PDT, with strong local and systemic effects.

         <title>Primitive Ligands Drive 1D CsPbI3 Nanostructures with Strongly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustration highlights I&#8722; concentration drives the structural evolution of CsPbI3 from cubic to orthorhombic phase, accompanied by octahedral distortion. In addition, increasing I&#8722; transforms nanorods into ginkgo&#8208;leaf&#8208;like assemblies, including a 659&#8211;683&#160;nm PL redshift due to bandgap narrowing and strain effects. These findings demonstrate precise phase and morphology control for tailored optoelectronic properties in perovskite nanostructures.








Abstract
Despite growing research efforts on inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, the mechanistic understanding of nucleation and growth kinetics remains insufficient for achieving precise morphology and crystal structure control. Herein, by simply modulating the concentrations of primitive ligands (e.g., I&#8722; and oleylamine) into conventional synthetic strategies, CsPbI3 perovskites, ranging from zero&#8208;dimensional quantum dots to unique one&#8208;dimensional nanowires/nanorods and ginkgo leaf&#8208;like architectures, can be realized. Mechanistic studies suggests that capping agents compete for adsorption on specific crystal facets, a finding further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Simultaneously, the crystal structures of the products undergo a phase transition from cubic to orthorhombic symmetry driven by lattice distortion that disrupts the crystal symmetry. In addition, temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence studies revealed that the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strengths of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons (&#947;LO = 73.14 meV and ELO(&#8463;&#969;LO)${E_{LO}}\;( {\hbar {\omega _{LO}}} )$ =&#160;28.74 meV) of CsPbI3 nanorods were much lower (&#947;LO = 103.25 meV and ELO = 33.62 meV) than those of ginkgo leaf&#8208;like CsPbI3 superstructures, limiting multi&#8208;phonon&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative pathways. As a result, CsPbI3 nanorods display a strong polarization dependence with a polarization degree of up to &#8764;0.49. These results not only demonstrates novel perovskite nanocrystals but also provide a versatile platform for tailoring perovskite NCs with combined morphological diversity and tunable optical properties.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Hydrogel Electrolyte Generated by Intrinsically Disordered Polymer Segments for Efficient Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy hydrogel electrolyte was demonstrated to enable the formation of entropically stabilized ion transport pathways, minimize water reactivity, and diminish contact ion pairing, thereby circumventing the long&#8208;lasting trade&#8208;off between high ion conduction and good electrochemical stability in hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes hold promise in enabling aqueous zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) as a sustainable energy storage technology, but they still suffer from the trade&#8208;off between high ion conduction and electrochemical stability. High&#8208;entropy engineering strategies are powerful in unlocking new regimes in energy storage, yet this paradigm has rarely been reported in hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy hydrogel electrolyte (HEHE) that integrates three ionic monomers to maximize compositional diversity and entropic stabilization. Multimodal experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the HEHE can promote the formation of entropically stabilized ion transport pathways, and minimize water reactivity and contact ion pairing, thereby enabling selective cation conduction, uniform ionic flux, low&#8208;energy interfacial desolvation, and crystallographic zinc deposition. The resulting HEHE circumvents the aforementioned dilemma, achieving essential electrochemical properties far exceeding those of the low&#8208;entropy counterpart, while enabling full ZMBs to work stably at a practically high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Such a HEHE uniquely orchestrates four entropy contributions within the gel matrix, and the applicability of this strategy is corroborated in parallel hydrogel electrolytes. This work establishes entropy&#8208;driven design as a generalizable approach for soft ion conductors, expanding the scope of high&#8208;entropy materials into aqueous batteries and beyond.

         <title>Autocatalytic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented autocatalytic cycle, mediated by the reduction of Ru(NH3)63+ and arising from the synergistic interplay between oxalate (C2O42&#8722;) and peroxydisulfate (S2O82&#8722;) via their radical intermediates, prompts ECL emission from Ru(bpy)32+ at potentials as low as &#8208;0.2&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl. This system generates ECL without direct oxidation of the luminophore, but instead through a cascade of redox&#8208;mediated electron transfers triggered by the mild reduction of Ru(NH3)63+.








Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a powerful analytical technique that generates light through electrochemically induced reactions, enabling ultrasensitive biosensing and imaging of submicrometric objects. Conventional ECL systems, such as those using Ru(bpy)32&#8314; and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA), require high applied potentials (oxidation at &#8764;1.4&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl), leading to electrode surface modification and parasitic reactions. Herein, we present a novel autocatalytic ECL mechanism that drastically lowers the triggering potential to &#8722;0.2&#160;V by exploiting the synergistic interplay between oxalate (C2O42&#8722;) and peroxydisulfate (S2O82&#8722;) radicals, mediated by Ru(NH3)63+ reduction. This system generates ECL without direct oxidation of the luminophore, but instead through a mild reduction process, relying on homogeneous radical reactions (SO4&#8226;&#8722; and CO2&#8226;&#8722;) to populate the Ru(bpy)32&#8314;* excited state. Experimental investigation at different Ru(NH3)63+/S2O82&#8722;/C2O42&#8722; concentration ratios, backed by finite element simulations, demonstrates the autocatalytic cycle's capability of exciting luminophores with a bandgap as high as 2.77&#160;eV (blue&#8208;emitting Ir(III) complex), while also showing a more stable ECL emission and achieving an emitting layer as thick as &#8764;4.8 &#177; 0.2&#160;&#181;m. These findings establish a low&#8208;potential ECL pathway with a large emitting layer, extending the applicability of such nontoxic coreactants&#8212;historically limited by their short&#8208;lived radicals&#8212;and potentially paving the way for new frontiers in ECL.

         <title>A Precisely Bromo&#8208;Functionalized [9]Cycloparaphenylene as a Platform for Late&#8208;Stage Multisite &#960;&#8208;Extension Toward Chiral Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely synthesized hexabrominated [9]cycloparaphenylene (CPP), accessed by a gold&#8208;mediated method, enables efficient multisite post&#8208;functionalization through cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Late&#8208;stage &#960;&#8208;extension on the CPP framework successfully affords armchair&#8208;type chiral nanohoops exhibiting strong circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| = 0.100).








Abstract
Selective functionalization of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) has remained a significant synthetic challenge due to their inherent ring strain. In this study, we present the synthesis of a [9]CPP derivative in which bromo groups are orderly introduced at the 2,5&#8208;positions of three benzene rings in the [9]CPP framework, each separated by two phenylene units. The use of our developed Au&#8208;mediated CPP synthetic method enabled efficient and scalable access to the target compound in five steps with an overall yield of 37%. The resulting molecule exhibited phosphorescence at low temperature, arising from the heavy&#8208;atom effect of the bromo substituents. Furthermore, post&#8208;functionalization through Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions demonstrated multisite &#960;&#8208;extension and afforded a chiral nanohoop exhibiting exceptional chiroptical performance (|glum| = 0.100).

         <title>Heterojunction Mediated Interfacial Selenium Vacancy Facilitating Spontaneous N&#9552;O Bonds Breakage Toward Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial selenium vacancy was constructed by selenide heterojunction. The VSe could induce enhanced nitrate adsorption and spontaneous N&#9552;O bonds breakage. Ni3Se4/CoSe2 heterojunction nanosheets array delivered excellent performance in NO3RR and zinc&#8211;nitrate battery.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrates reduction reaction driven by green electricity provides a feasible pathway for simultaneously achieving the elimination of nitrates pollutants and production of valuable ammonia. However, the electrocatalytic efficiency is limited by the low ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency. Vacancy engineering is an efficient strategy for improving the performance of catalysts. Here, we develop an efficient strategy of heterojunction (Ni3Se4/CoSe2) mediated interfacial selenium vacancy toward efficient ammonia electrosynthesis. In situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the interfacial selenium vacancy on CoSe2 segment strengthens the adsorption of nitrates, spontaneously breaks the N&#9552;O bonds of nitrates, thereby accelerating the overall NO3RR. The Ni3Se4/CoSe2 heterojunction nanosheets array achieves an ammonia yield of 1.44&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 94.8% at a current density of 350&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Ni3Se4/CoSe2 heterojunction electrode was assembled into a zinc&#8211;nitrate battery as the cathode, delivering an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.46&#160;V, a maximum power density of 12.71&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, and a charge&#8211;discharge stability of over 168&#160;h.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Super&#8208;Resolution Tracking of mtDNA Remodeling and Inflammatory Release with a Selective Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents mtNARed, an mtDNA&#8208;selective probe for super&#8208;resolution imaging that enables nanoscale visualization and long&#8208;term tracking of mtDNA in living cells, including highly polarized sperm. Moreover, mtNARed reveals stress&#8208;induced mtDNA remodeling and inflammatory release, providing a new platform for real&#8208;time super&#8208;resolution studies of mitochondrial genome dynamics and immune activation.








Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis, with its spatiotemporal dynamics are tightly linked to development, metabolism, and disease progression. However, super&#8208;resolution tracking of mtDNA in live cells remains limited by lack of selective, photostable small&#8208;molecule probes. Here, we present mtNARed, a rationally engineered, wash&#8208;free fluorescent probe featuring a large Stokes&#8208;shift, and high photostability that enables super&#8208;resolution tracking of mtDNA dynamics in live cells using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, with complementary readouts by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). mtNARed precisely localizes to mitochondrial nucleoids and supports long&#8208;term imaging while minimizing interference from nuclear DNA. This capability generalizes across diverse mammalian cell types, including highly polarized sperm cells. Importantly, under mitochondrial stress or inflammatory stimulation, mtNARed reports in situ and at super&#8208;resolution of the progressive release of mtDNA, correlating with mitochondrial depolarization, membrane disintegration, and immune activation. This work provides a robust and versatile platform for advanced mtDNA imaging, opening opportunities to dissect mitochondrial genome dynamics, maintenance, and signaling across physiological and pathological states.

         <title>Unveiling Anion&#8208;Cation Interaction of Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Life Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion/cation dehydration shielding force as effective descriptor is proposed for designing high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolytes to achieve the anion&#8208;cation coordination structure, protecting Zn anode from side reaction and dendrite growth, which enables Ah&#8208;level pouch cells to achieve excellent cyclability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are attractive for stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, parasitic side reactions and severe Zn dendrites hinder practical implementation. Here, we propose the anion/cation dehydration shielding force as an effective guideline for electrolyte engineering that prioritizes anion&#8208;cation coordination structure. The methodology identifies 2&#8208;ethoxyethanol solvent as optimal components, enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and suppressing water activity through anion&#8208;dominated coordination chemistry. The preferential reduction of OTF&#8722; enables fluorine&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase formation with high Zn2+ conductivity and excellent mechanical robustness, protecting Zn anode from side reaction and dendrite growth. As a result, the designed electrolyte enables symmetric Zn||Zn pouch cells to achieve 1500&#160;h cycling with a remarkable cumulative capacity of 30&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2 under demanding conditions (20 and 10&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2). More importantly, Ah&#8208;level pouch cells set extremely excellent durability milestones, maintaining 1400 cycles (4.2 months/3000&#160;h operation) while outperforming most reported Zn metal counterparts in comparable capacity ranges.

         <title>Photoredox/Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Radical Addition to Imines with Furanosyl 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines to Access C&#8208;Glycosyl Amino Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic photoredox/cobalt catalysis platform developed for asymmetric C&#8208;glycosylation addresses the longstanding problem of simultaneously constructing a stereogenic center at the challenging non&#8208;anomeric site and a new tetrasubstituted carbon center. This versatile method based on the use of stable furanosyl 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs) as radical precursors was also applied to simple alkyl DHPs, providing efficient access to valuable amino esters.








Abstract
Chiral oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles, particularly tetrahydrofuran scaffolds are pivotal structures found in numerous bioactive molecules. Among them, furanoses constitute a highly important class. While C&#8208;glycosylation with furanosyl donors offers a promising route to access these frameworks, methods for simultaneously constructing multiple stereogenic centers remain unknown. Herein, we report a synergistic photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical addition strategy to imines that employs bench&#8208;stable furanosyl 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) as the radical precursors. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol directly forges C&#8208;glycosidic bonds at the challenging non&#8208;anomeric position while concurrently establishing a new tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter. The chiral cobalt catalyst effectively governs the stereochemistry of both the glycosidic bond and the new tetrasubstituted center, as evidenced by ligand control experiments. Furthermore, the method is generalizable to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted DHPs, providing a versatile and complementary approach to synthesize amino esters and C&#8208;glycosides with multiple stereogenic centers.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic/Heterogeneous Catalytic Cascade for Selective Production of Propylene Oxide via Anodic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a cascade strategy for the selective synthesis of propylene oxide (PO) by coupling anodic H2O2 generation with TS&#8208;1 catalyzed propylene epoxidation. By immobilizing TS&#8208;1 on a gas diffusion layer, the system achieves high PO productivity with efficient H2O2 utilization, providing a safer and greener alternative to conventional PO production.








Abstract
Propylene oxide, a key intermediate with wide applications in the plastics industry, is still mainly produced by energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally non&#8208;sustainable processes. Electrochemically assisted epoxidation of propylene is emerging as a sustainable and atom&#8208;efficient method for highly selective synthesis of propylene oxide. Here, we introduce a cascade strategy that combines anodic H2O2 generation with propylene epoxidation at a porous layer of immobilized titanium silicate (TS&#8208;1). A ZnWO4 electrocatalyst was developed for efficient anodic H2O2 generation. To maximize local reactant concentrations, we designed an integrated TS&#8208;1&#8208;immobilized gas diffusion layer, which facilitates rapid propylene transport to the triple&#8208;phase boundaries, while preventing TS&#8208;1 loss and avoiding separation issues common in solution&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalytic systems. Furthermore, an acetonitrile&#8208;bicarbonate containing electrolyte system was optimized to facilitate direct utilization of H2O2 for propylene epoxidation, leading to 98% H2O2 utilization efficiency and over 97% selectivity for propylene oxide. This work offers a safer and greener alternative for propylene oxide production and broadens the application of electrochemically generated H2O2 from water oxidation for selective oxygenation reactions.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8211;Guided Solvation Engineering of Chiral Viologens for Durable Neutral Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers the use of machine learning&#8208;engineered chiral viologens to overcome solubility limitations and enhance alkaline resilience through solvation effects. It demonstrates the successful kg&#8208;scale preparation and Ah&#8208;class stack validation of chiral viologens for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) during long&#8208;term energy storage.








Abstract
Conventional N&#8208;alkylated viologen electrolytes in neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) undergo irreversible nucleophilic SN2 dealkylation degradation. Moreover, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error molecular design often fails to resolve the solubility&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in high&#8208;concentration systems. Here we report a machine learning (ML) strategy using large language models (LLMs) trained on over 1300 AORFB studies to predict chiral viologens with ortho&#8208;dihydroxy motifs. This bonding network forms a dynamic, pH&#8208;adaptive &#8220;solvation armor&#8221; that stabilizes the viologen structure. The R&#8208;/S&#8208;enantiomers (2.75/2.76&#160;M) exhibit 1.66 times higher solubility versus RS&#8208;racemate. Molecular simulations and in situ spectroscopy confirm that the dihydroxy groups protect reactive C&#9472;N bonds via a solvation structure (unrelated to chiral effect), enhancing stability to pH 11. The 1&#160;M R2+/R+&#8226; redox couple sets a new record by achieving 99.42% capacity retention over 3652 cycles. The 1&#160;M R&#8208;based AORFB shows 100% retention over 533 cycles, outperforming quaternary ammonium&#8208; ([(NPr)2&#160;V]Cl4, 94.92%) and sulfonate&#8208;modified viologen ((SPr)2&#160;V), 65.49%). Stable cycling across 0.1 &#8764; 2.5&#160;M demonstrates decoupling of degradation from concentration. This strategy is validated by 2.5&#160;kg&#8208;scale synthesis and Ah&#8208;class stack testing (98.65% retention over 77 cycles), demonstrating industrial scalability. This work establishes a generalizable, ML&#8208;enabled platform for electrolyte development, bridging molecular design and practical AORFB deployment.

A series of deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#8208;transparent organic sulfonates were designed and synthesized for high&#8208;performing optical nonlinearities, as reported by Chao Wu, Chi Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e21786). Three key parameters including second&#8208;harmonic generation, bandgap, and birefringence were synchronously optimized in the polar organic sulfonate by employing a connectivity&#8208;regulation approach. The work highlights that structural connectivity change can profoundly influence key nonlinear optical properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Unusual S=1 Fe(0)&#8208;Silyl Complexes Supported by Styrene Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long&#8208;standing importance of iron&#8208;silicon bonds as related to catalysis, high&#8208;spin Fe(0)&#8208;silyl complexes remain a historical synthetic challenge in the field. Herein, we report the first series of high&#8208;spin S&#160;=&#160;1, styrene&#8208;stabilized Fe(0)&#8208;silyl complexes followed by extensive characterization via M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Evans NMR, and computational analysis.

Abstract
In this research we report unprecedented high&#8208;spin (S&#160;=&#160;1) Fe(0)&#8208;silyl complexes stabilized by simple styrene ligands. Access to these novel complexes follows a straightforward route through previously reported Fe(0)&#8208;alkyl complexes paired with a range of aryl silanes to promote the protonation of the alkyl substituent and subsequent coordination of the silicon moiety. Spectroscopic and structural analyses (SC&#8208;XRD, Evans Method, 80&#160;K 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer) established their unique electronic and structural configuration while DFT calculations further probed electronic structure and bonding effects of the styrene to Fe(0) centres, identifying essential electronic stability. By uncovering the first high&#8208;spin (S&#160;=&#160;1), alkene stabilized Fe(0)&#8208;silyl complexes, this work offers further fundamental insights into Fe&#8211;Si bonding that can contribute to future insights into reactivity.

         <title>A&#160;Low&#8208;carbon Space&#8208;Isolated Zinc Hydrolysis for Harvesting Hydrogen and Salts from Seawater and Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for hydrogen/salt coproduction and waste treatment using seawater/wastewater as a feedstock with electrolytic Zn as the mediator.








Abstract
The direct use of seawater/wastewater for H2 production remains a challenge because impurities in the water compromise electrolyzer stability. Here, we propose a two&#8208;step approach that uses seawater/wastewater for H2 generation, salt recovery, and pollutant degradation. First, Zn hydrolysis occurs at 250&#160;&#176;C in a space&#8208;isolated system, where vapor reacts with solid Zn to generate porous ZnO and H2 at the Zn/vapor interface, achieving up to 99.8% H2 production efficiency. The physical isolation ensures automatic separation of ZnO, salts, and H2 while facilitating in situ hydrogenation that degrades 96.9% of organic phenol, demonstrating pollutant remediation. To close the materials&#8208;loop, the produced ZnO is electrochemically reduced back to Zn with a 99.3% Faradaic efficiency. We validate scalability using a 72 Ah Zn electrolyzer coupled with a 1000&#160;mL reactor, achieving batch production of 2.32&#160;g H2 and 0.92&#160;g seasalt. LCA confirms this combined electrolysis&#8211;hydrolysis approach has fewer carbon emissions and environmental footprints. Beyond H2 production, this system leverages Zn as both an energy carrier to mitigate renewable energy intermittency and a versatile agent for salt recovery and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Lattice Compressibility versus Emission Properties: A Trade&#8208;Off in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Bimetallic Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a series of hybrid La&#8208;Sb bimetallic bromides La(L)n[SbBr6], incorporating three different organic ligands (L&#160;=&#160;DMSO, MU and DMU). By altering the coordinating ligands, we systematically varied the hydrogen&#8208;bonding strength, which directly controlled the lattice compressibility. This work reveals a fundamental trade&#8208;off in these materials: high structural rigidity (low compressibility) is essential for stable and efficient emission under pressure, yet it concurrently limits pressure&#8208;induced tunability and can promote photoluminescence quenching. 








Abstract
Hybrid metal halide perovskites exhibit interesting optoelectronic properties that are highly tunable and sensitive via structural manipulation, whether intrinsically designed or induced by pressure stimuli. Their soft lattices are generally easy to compress, where the bulk modulus (B0) decreases with decreasing dimensionality from 3D to 0D. Here, we show that an unusually large B0 of 119&#160;GPa beyond 2&#160;GPa can be achieved through the control of coordinated solvent ligand in a 0D hybrid bimetallic bromides series, namely La(L)n[SbBr6] (L&#160;=&#160;dimethyl sulfoxide, 1&#8208;methylurea, and 1,3&#8208;dimethylurea). We identify a striking inverse relation between B0 and photoluminescence (PL) under pressure, mediated by hydrogen&#8208;bonding strength. Stronger hydrogen bonds create a more rigid structure (high B0), which causes a rapid quenching of emission. This phenomenon is generally observed in the La(L)n[SbBr6] series, with all undergoing a universal quenching of PL intensity once a compressibility limit is reached at &#8764;2&#160;GPa. This work provides a paradigm for controlling the compressibility in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid materials and establishes a fundamental principle regarding the compressibility and optical property evolutions.

         <title>Constructing Hydrogen Migration Channel from Atomic Clusters to Single Atom for Superior Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultralow Pt Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a breakthrough in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis via a &#8220;reaction decoupling&#8221; strategy. A dual&#8208;active&#8208;site architecture with PtMn atomic clusters and neighboring Pt single atoms on S&#8208;doped carbon is engineered. This design spatially separates H* generation (on PtMn atomic clusters) from H* recombination/desorption (on Pt single atoms), enabling independent step optimization and overcoming the Sabatier limitation of single&#8208;site catalysts.








Abstract
Developing highly active and durable cathode catalysts using minimal use of noble metal remains a grand challenge for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Herein we design a Pt&#8208;based sub&#8208;nanometric catalysts featuring coexisting single atoms and atomic clusters anchored on sulfur&#8208;doped carbon. This dual&#8208;active&#8208;site architecture enables independent optimization of active hydrogen (H*) formation and subsequent recombination kinetics, thus breaking the limitation of Sabatier principle. Specially, by introducing a secondary transition metal such as Mn, the interfacial charge distribution and work function of Pt clusters is regulated, promoting both H* formation and migration. Meanwhile, the neighboring electron&#8208;deficient Pt single atoms facilitate H* recombination kinetics. The catalyst with 3.6 wt% Pt loading achieves a recorded mass activity of 14.48 A mg&#8722;1 at 15&#160;mV, exceeding commercial 40wt% Pt/C by 41&#8208;fold. When integrated into an electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates exceptional activity and stability with only 10% Pt loading relative to commercial benchmark, representing a critical advancement toward practical green hydrogen production. Also, the direct evidences of H* formation, migration and recombination process are confirmed by operando experiments and theoretical calculations for the first time, which offers new concept for decoupling of HER reaction and rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Based Ratiometric Sensors for Simultaneous Multi&#8208;Bio&#8208;Analyte Imaging in Living Cells Using Spontaneous Raman Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce Activity&#8208;Based Alkyne&#8208;Tag Raman Sensors, ABATaRs. ABATaRs, strategically founded on &#8216;push&#8208;pull&#8217; dyad based aromatic mono&#8208;alkyne motifs overcome sensitivity issues associated with Raman sensors. Highly sensitive, cell&#8208;permeable, ratiometric ABATaRs sense Cu ions, hydrogen peroxide, and pH at low sensor concentrations and achieve simultaneous multi&#8208;analyte imaging in living cells on a spontaneous Raman scattering microscope, opening avenues to elucidate life processes.








Abstract
Raman&#8208;scattering comes with the promise of multi&#8208;bio&#8208;analyte imaging because of narrow peak&#8208;widths. This feature combined with alkyne/nitrile tags accessing the cell&#8208;silent region, have catalyzed the development of Raman&#8208;probes. In this backdrop, Raman&#8208;responsive ratiometric sensors will be key players for imaging bio&#8208;analytes. A major challenge, however, is low Raman&#8208;scattering cross&#8208;sections of alkynes/nitriles, leading to probes with low sensitivity and reliance on stimulated Raman which is not widely accessible. Raman&#8208;responsive ratiometric sensors for the accessible spontaneous Raman imaging platform still remain elusive. We have leveraged the &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; effect to achieve novel activity&#8208;based alkyne&#8208;tag Raman sensors (ABATaRs) with high sensitivity. ABATaRs show high computed Raman&#8208;scattering activities 12&#8211;38&#160;times that of benchmark 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (EdU), significantly high experimental Raman intensity versus EdU between 5 and 22, and relative Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections for the alkyne stretching with respect to dimethyl&#8208;sulfoxide C&#8208;H stretching as high as 466. To demonstrate generality, cell&#8208;permeable, ratiometric ABATaRs for pH, hydrogen peroxide, and Cu ions were developed. ABATaRs can image physiological and pathophysiological levels of bio&#8208;analytes in live&#8208;cells at as low as 1&#8211;5&#160;&#181;M sensor concentrations on a spontaneous Raman microscope and distinctly enhance spontaneous Raman imaging&#8208;speed. In a key advance, we demonstrate simultaneous multi&#8208;analyte Raman&#8208;imaging of bio&#8208;correlated Cu ions and hydrogen peroxide in live&#8208;cells.

         <title>A Surface Non&#8208;Destructive Modification Strategy Addressing Moisture and Oxidation Instabilities of Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical application of sulfide solid electrolytes is hindered by inherent oxidative instability and high moisture sensitivity. Herein, we report an in situ, non&#8208;destructive surface modification strategy, in which nucleophilic S2&#8722; anions on Li6PS5Cl initiate ring&#8208;opening polymerization of ethylene sulfate to form a protective poly(sulfate) layer. This approach enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with NCM955 cathode to deliver 231.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;C and retain 70% capacity after 36,000 cycles at 10&#160;C.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), owing to their high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial conformability. However, their practical application is hindered by inherent oxidative instability and high moisture sensitivity. Herein, we propose an in situ, non&#8208;destructive modification strategy for sulfide electrolyte Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) by leveraging the nucleophilic S2&#8722; anions on its surface to initiate the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane 2,2&#8208;dioxide (ethylene sulfate, DTD), thus forming a uniform and dense poly(sulfate) (PS) modification layer. This layer effectively shields the electrolyte from direct exposure to moisture and high&#8208;voltage cathodes, greatly enhancing both moisture tolerance and oxidation stability. ASSBs fabricated with the modified PS&#8208;LPSC electrolyte, a high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM955) cathode and a LiIn anode, exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, delivering capacities of 231.6, 208.1, 138.3, and 98.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2, 1, 10, and 20&#160;C, respectively, at room temperature. Remarkably, the cells retain 70.0% capacity after 36,000 cycles at 10&#160;C under room temperature, and 62.4% after 20,000 cycles even under harsh conditions (50&#160;C and 60&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability and practical applicability. This study provides a facile and efficient surface modification route to enhance the oxidation and moisture stability of sulfide solid electrolytes.

         <title>A Nonviral Neo&#8208;Nucleocapsid for Cell&#8208;Specific RNA Delivery Developed by Pseudo&#8208;Cyclic Peptide Grafting and Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonviral neo&#8208;nucleocapsids developed from a repurposed bacterial protein cage, and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via protein&#8208;protein ligation, bacteria&#8208;based directed evolution, lasso&#8208;grafting, and mammalian cell&#8208;based directed evolution enabled cell specific RNA delivery.








Abstract
Nonviral protein vehicles for RNA delivery hold significant promises for various biotechnological applications due to their scalability, ease of engineering, and high biocompatibility. Directed evolution is a powerful approach to enhance protein activity, yet few nonviral protein vehicles have been evolved due to the challenges in linking genotype and phenotype. Here, we report engineering and directed evolution of a neo&#8208;nucleocapsid enabling receptor&#8208;specific RNA delivery. We applied the DogTag/DogCatcher protein ligation system to an artificial nucleocapsid and conducted directed evolution to obtain nucleocapsid displaying proteins. To create designer neo&#8208;nucleocapsids, we lasso&#8208;grafted a pharmacophore sequence of a pseudo&#8208;cyclic peptide binding to the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET into the loop of DogCatcher. After the cellular&#8208;based directed evolution, endocytic uptake of neo&#8208;nucleocapsids was improved whereas cytosolic release and subsequent protein expression from the delivered RNA were not detected. This experimental approach provides a versatile system for constructing protein cages delivering various cargos to specific cells.

         <title>Biomimetic Anchor&#8208;Capture Effect of Multidentate Electrolyte Additive for Ultrastable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a bio&#8208;inspired anchor&#8208;capture effect using stevia, a multi&#8208;dentate additive featuring flexible multi&#8208;dentate hydrophilic chain and rigid skeleton to simultaneously achieve robust interface construction and rapid Zn2+ capture.








Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reactions on Zn anodes severely limit the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Electrolyte additive engineering offers a promising solution. This work proposes a bio&#8208;inspired anchor&#8208;capture effect using the multi&#8208;dentate additive to simultaneously achieve robust interface construction and rapid Zn2+ capture. Stevia (ST), a natural biomass extract featuring flexible multi&#8208;dentate hydrophilic chain and rigid skeleton is selected as a proof of concept. Systematic characterizations and theoretical calculations verify the anchor&#8208;capture effect of ST as trace electrolyte additive. On one hand, ST molecules preferentially adsorb and accumulate on the Zn anode surface, promoting the formation of homogeneous electrode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layer and reconstructing the interfacial hydrogen bonding network. On the other hand, the flexible multi&#8208;dentate hydrophilic chains enhance the capture and immobilization of Zn2+, suppressing the 2D diffusion and guiding uniform deposition. Additionally, the strong binding energy between Zn2+ and ST facilitates the desolvation process. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetrical cells exhibit an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan (&gt;8800&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), Zn||Cu asymmetrical cells perform exceptional reversibility (the average coulombic efficiency&#160;&gt;&#160;99.5% over 1200 cycles) and Zn||VO2 full cells retain almost 100% capacity over 1000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. The biomimetic interface engineering strategy provides valuable insights for developing green electrolyte additives to stabilize Zn anodes.

         <title>Facilely Enantiopurified Novel Double Aza[7]Helicenes for Extremely Narrowband Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;active double aza[7]helicene is developed based on all&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazole scaffolds, showing narrowband pure green emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 18&#160;nm and high electroluminescent performance. Additionally, the enantiopure P,P&#8208; and M,M&#8208;configurations are readily isolated via conventional thin&#8208;layer chromatography, achieving an impressive luminescent dissymmetry factor of&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance multi&#8208;helicenes are promising for efficient narrowband emission and chiroptical properties, yet systems based predominantly on boron&#8211;nitrogen frameworks often exhibit broadened spectra. Here, we present a brand&#8208;new double aza[7]helicene built on a nitrogen&#8208;containing indolocarbazole scaffold, incorporating four consecutive para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms arranged through alternating fusion of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings. This tailored structure enhances the multi&#8208;resonance effect, enabling pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 18&#160;nm, a photoluminescence quantum yield of 90%, and a chromaticity y&#8208;coordinate of 0.70, while also stabilizing the double helix configuration. The enantiomers are readily separated using conventional thin&#8208;layer chromatography, avoiding costly chiral columns, and show strong circularly polarized luminescence with dissymmetry factors of 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes achieve high&#8208;color&#8208;purity green electroluminescence, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.2%, maintaining&#160;&gt;&#160;20% at 100,000&#160;cd/m2. This work provides a new paradigm for high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;helicenes with chiral optoelectronics.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced Triple Synergistic Modulation of CuBi Clusters for Enhanced Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered defects in CuBi clusters concurrently stabilize the critical *NO2 intermediate, enhance CO2 adsorption, and activate water molecules, synergistically boosting the coreduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 to urea. This triple synergistic modulation breaks the kinetic bottleneck, leading to a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 53.1%, and a tenfold increase over its well&#8208;defined counterpart.








Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8211;N coupling of CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a promising green approach for synthesizing urea. However, achieving efficient C&#8211;N coupling remains challenging because of the kinetic mismatch between CO2 and NO3&#8722; reduction. Stabilizing key N&#8208;containing intermediates to facilitate their coupling with C&#8208;containing intermediates is crucial for achieving high Faradaic efficiency. In this study, defect&#8208;rich CuBi clusters (D&#8208;CuBi) were synthesized, and the effects of the enhanced functionalities of the defects of D&#8208;CuBi on the performance of urea synthesis at different critical processes were systematically investigated. Density functional theory calculations and in situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis revealed that the defects in D&#8208;CuBi facilitated the adsorption of CO2 and prevented the desorption of the key *NO2 intermediate as NO2&#8722;. Moreover, these sites facilitated the adsorption of active water molecules, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics for urea production. As a result, the D&#8208;CuBi catalyst achieved a remarkable urea Faradaic efficiency of 53.1% and a yield rate of 2.57&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at&#160;&#8722;1.0&#160;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, representing an approximately tenfold enhancement over the intact CuBi. This work presents insight into urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; through defect engineering.

         <title>Interface Molecular Locking Synergized with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel interface molecular locking (IML) strategy synergized with self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for perovskite solar cells. A high&#8208;coverage hole&#8208;selective layer is formed through combining the advantages of two SAMs. Additionally, thiabendazole is introduced into the perovskite precursor to achieve molecular locking at the buried interface. Consequently, the optimized devices achieve efficiencies exceeding 26.0% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
The uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the interfacial defects in perovskite films significantly affect the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, we develop an innovative interface molecular locking (IML) strategy synergized with SAMs to enhance the properties of buried interface. Specifically, two SAMs&#8212;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz) and 5&#8208;indoleboronic acid (5&#8208;IBA)&#8212;are employed to combine their advantages and form an enhanced SAM (E&#8208;SAM). Due to the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between MeO&#8208;PhPACz and 5&#8208;IBA, the E&#8208;SAM exhibits a denser and more uniform morphological coverage. Introducing thiabendazole (TBZ) additive into the perovskite precursor further ameliorates the buried interface properties through its self&#8208;assembly behavior, owing to its large molecular dipole moment and strong interactions with the E&#8208;SAM. This strategy not only achieves favorable energy level alignment but also improves the crystallinity and reduces the trap density of perovskite films, thereby significantly enhancing hole extraction and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, both (FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 and FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3&#8208;based IPSCs achieve high efficiencies exceeding 26.0%, along with significantly enhanced stability. Notably, (FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 solar cells deliver a high voltage of 1.21&#160;V, one of the highest reported among IPSCs with a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap. Our findings provide unique insights into achieving high&#8208;performance IPSCs by synergistically engineering buried interface.

         <title>Engineering Isoquinoline&#8208;derived Directing Template for Distal C5&#8722;H Functionalization of Bicyclic Aza&#8208;arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategically engineered isoquinoline&#8208;based catalytic directing template enables highly selective distal benzocyclic C5&#9472;H activation of bicyclic aza&#8208;arenes. This design unlocks diverse C5 alkenylation and unprecedented alkynylation, establishing a robust platform for remote C&#9472;H functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant benzoazines. Mechanistic studies, supported by X&#8208;ray and spectroscopic evidence for possible intermediates, clarify the pathway.








Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused mono&#8208; and di&#8208;azines constitute privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals and functional materials; however, achieving site&#8208;selective remote benzocyclic C&#9472;H functionalization on these motifs remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of an ideal tethering site for directing group (DG) and the tendency of heteroatom to deactivate metal catalysts. Herein, we report a robust isoquinoline&#8208;based directing template that enables catalytic, site&#8208;selective C5&#9472;H functionalization of benzo&#8208;fused azines.

     alt="Engineering Isoquinoline-derived Directing Template for Distal C5&#8722;H Functionalization of Bicyclic Aza-arenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategically engineered isoquinoline-based catalytic directing template enables highly selective distal benzocyclic C5&#9472;H activation of bicyclic aza-arenes. This design unlocks diverse C5 alkenylation and unprecedented alkynylation, establishing a robust platform for remote C&#9472;H functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant benzoazines. Mechanistic studies, supported by X-ray and spectroscopic evidence for possible intermediates, clarify the pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzo-fused mono- and di-azines constitute privileged scaffolds in pharmaceuticals and functional materials; however, achieving site-selective remote benzocyclic C&#9472;H functionalization on these motifs remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of an ideal tethering site for directing group (DG) and the tendency of heteroatom to deactivate metal catalysts. Herein, we report a robust isoquinoline-based directing template that enables catalytic, site-selective C5&#9472;H functionalization of benzo-fused azines. The template recruits the substrate through reversible &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-coordination, allowing the strong &#963;-donating isoquinolinyl arm to position the metal catalyst for precise activation of the remote C5&#9472;H bond. This design facilitates efficient alkenylation with a broad range of alkenes, which are otherwise inaccessible with conventional stoichiometric nitrile-based templates reported in the literature. Notably, this new class of directing template unlocks the unprecedented C5&#9472;H alkynylation, further demonstrating the pivotal role of structural tuning of the directing entity in facilitating diverse C5&#9472;H functionalization transformations. Various key intermediates have been intercepted by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and complementary spectroscopic analyses to shed light on the mechanism of the catalytic cycle. The mechanistic study also discloses that the cooperativity exists between the directing template (DT) and the template chaperone (TC) in the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Cristaxenicin A: Construction of Nine&#8208;Membered Ring by Eschenmoser&#8211;Claisen/Cope Rearrangement Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;cristaxenicin A was achieved by employing a one&#8208;pot sequence of the Eschenmoser&#8211;Claisen and Cope rearrangement reactions to construct the nine&#8208;membered ring from a five&#8208;membered nitrile. After formation of the trans&#8208;fused bicyclic skeleton through an intramolecular Stetter reaction, the cyclopentene ring was transformed into a dihydropyran ring by oxidative cleavage, followed by intramolecular acetalization.








Abstract
Cristaxenicin A, a natural marine product with a skeleton consisting of a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle fused with a dihydropyran ring, displays strong antiprotozoal activity against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma congolense. The synthesis of cristaxenicin A is challenging because of its unique oxidation pattern at C11 and C20, the cis&#8208;cyclononane with a C5&#9472;C6 double bond, and the C1&#9472;C19 alkene moiety functionalized as an enol acetate. Herein, we report the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;cristaxenicin A. The nine&#8208;membered ring was constructed from 2,2&#8208;divinylcyclopentanecarbonitrile through an addition reaction with 4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy&#8208;2&#8208;butenal followed by a one&#8208;pot sequence of the Eschenmoser&#8211;Claisen and Cope rearrangement reactions. After the formation of a trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecane skeleton through an intramolecular Stetter reaction, the cyclopentane ring was transformed into a dihydropyran ring by oxidative cleavage, followed by intramolecular acetalization. Two reactions described herein, namely, the formation of a cyclononadiene ring via the Cope rearrangement without using an oxy&#8208;Cope substrate and a new protocol for the construction of a dihydropyran ring from a cyclopentene derivative, provide a powerful tool for the total synthesis of natural products with highly functionalized complex structures.

         <title>Laser Irradiation Induced Ru Cluster&#8208;Based Catalysts with Dual Spillover Pathways for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective laser irradiation strategy has been proposed and demonstrated for constructing Ru clusters on oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Co(OH)x with dual spillover pathways for intermediates of hydrogen evolution reaction. The as&#8208;obtained catalyst therefore delivers excellent performance for this reaction.








Abstract
Ru cluster&#8208;based electrocatalysts are promising for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the strong adsorption of H* and OH* intermediates during water dissociation on these clusters severely hampers subsequent gas evolution. Herein, we report a rational design of Co(OH)x&#8208;supported Ru clusters (L&#8208;Ru/Co(OH)x) through laser irradiation featuring dual spillover pathways for H* and OH*. The laser irradiation induces a localized thermal effect with fast heating and quenching, which simultaneously generates uniformly dispersed oxygen vacancies (OVs) on Co(OH)x nanosheets and forms ultrafine Ru clusters that are directly anchored at the OVs. The L&#8208;Ru/Co(OH)x enables a synergistic electron redistribution among Ru clusters, OVs, and the adjacent Co sites, yielding electron&#8208;rich Ru and Co sites along with electron&#8208;deficient OVs. Such electron modulation facilitates spillover of H* and OH* on the Ru clusters to the adjacent electron&#8208;rich Co sites and OVs, respectively, promoting continuous hydrogen evolution. The optimal catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 13&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 42&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming most reported catalysts. When used in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the device achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.68 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V, which is about 2.16 times higher than that on RuO2||Pt/C benchmark.

         <title>Boosting Crystal Growth and Radioluminescence in Hybrid Cu(I) Halide Scintillators via Additive&#8208;Strengthened Ionic and Electron&#8211;Phonon Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a computationally guided &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; additive strategy that simultaneously enhances ionic interactions between the C6H18N22+ organic ligand and Cu&#8211;I clusters, and promotes intersystem charge transfer through controlled lattice distortion. This dual modulation not only accelerates solute aggregation at crystal growth interfaces, enabling expanded crystal morphology, but also strengthens electron&#8211;phonon coupling, thereby boosting STE mediated radioluminescence.








Abstract
We herein address two fundamental challenges in rod&#8208;like ionic hybrid copper(I) halide scintillators&#8212;insufficient metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer leading to low radioluminescence efficiency, and anisotropic crystal growth that restricts the fabrication of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline scintillator screen. Guided by computational insight, we introduce a &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; molecular strategy employing neutral 1,2&#8208;propanediamine (1,2&#8208;PDA) as a dual&#8208;function additive in C6H18N2Cu2I4. Comprehensive mechanistic studies reveal that 1,2&#8208;PDA not only strengthens ionic interactions between organic ligand (C6H18N22+) and Cu(I) halide clusters, promoting oriented aggregation at crystal interfaces, but also induces significant lattice distortion upon defect incorporation, which enhances intersystem crossing and intensifies electron&#8211;phonon coupling, thereby boosting self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission. This synergistic mechanism yields a 3&#8208;fold enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY: 17.53% to 52.96%) and a 2.77&#8208;fold enhancement in radioluminescence intensity. Moreover, we achieved a large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline film (&#8776;10&#160;&#215;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;0.31&#160;mm3) demonstrates exceptional X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 22.3&#160;lp mm&#8722;1. This approach demonstrates broad applicability across diverse hybrid metal halides, concurrently improving crystal dimensionality and scintillation performance, thus establishing a versatile molecular design rule for high&#8208;performance radiation detection materials.

Moreover, we achieved a large-area single-crystalline film (&#8776;10&#160;&#215;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;0.31&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) demonstrates exceptional X-ray imaging resolution of 22.3&#160;lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This approach demonstrates broad applicability across diverse hybrid metal halides, concurrently improving crystal dimensionality and scintillation performance, thus establishing a versatile molecular design rule for high-performance radiation detection materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Protein&#8208;Based Nanofiltration Membranes with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Pores via Amyloid&#8208;Like Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological ion channels and transmembrane proteins, a transformative general strategy was proposed to push the pore size of synthetic protein&#8208;based membranes to the sub&#8208;nanometer via amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation. The ion separation performance is enhanced by tuning the membrane pore size and surface charge through polyphenol cross&#8208;linking, offering a novel route toward high&#8208;performance biomimetic separation membranes.








Abstract
Membrane proteins in biology achieve highly efficient selective molecular recognition and transmembrane transport by constructing sub&#8208;nanometer channels. However, achieving comparable selectivity in artificial protein&#8208;based membranes remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the difficulty of precisely tailoring sub&#8208;nanometer pore sizes. Here, we present a breakthrough in the fabrication of proteinaceous nanofiltration membranes with precisely defined sub&#8208;nanometer pores. A robust protein membrane with pore sizes of 0.62&#8211;0.81&#160;nm is formed at the air/water interface via a thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction. Subsequent crosslinking with polyphenol further reduces the pore size to &#8764;0.4&#160;nm, while simultaneously inverting surface charge from positive to negative and markedly enhancing ion sieving performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the crosslinked amyloid&#8208;like protein membrane achieves 98.24% rejection of MgCl2 and an excellent Mg2+/Li+ selectivity of 88.65 in a simulated salt&#8208;lake brine, surpassing the performance of most polymer membranes reported to date. Additionally, this membrane demonstrates versatility in separating anions with different valences, removing heavy metal ions, and eliminating persistent organic pollutants, while exhibiting excellent chemical stability and anti&#8208;fouling capability in acidic, alkaline, and organic solvent environments. By harnessing the precision of biological channels, this work offers a paradigm shift for next&#8208;generation biomimetic ion separation, environmental remediation, and water purification applications.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering of Polythiophene Probes for Multimodal Discrimination of PFAS via Conformational Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythiophene derivative PT32 demonstrates selective and pH&#8211;robust, discriminative detection of PFOA/PFOS on multimodal (UV&#8211;vis/colorimetric/fluorescence) platforms. The unique sensing response is attributed to distinct conformational changes in PT32, facilitated by electrostatic, fluorophilic, and hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, PT32 can be facilely recovered post&#8211;detection, enabling sustainable environmental monitoring.








Abstract
Discriminating between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), while suppressing interference from common surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we tackled this challenge through a rational side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, designing a series of cationic polythiophenes that exploit analyte&#8208;specific conformational transitions for unprecedented selectivity. Among them, PT32 was utilized as a trimodal (UV&#8211;vis absorption, colorimetric, and fluorometric) probe, enabling discriminative detection of PFOA/PFOS and distinction from other anionic surfactants. The system demonstrates clear visual and spectral discriminability, with PFOA inducing a distinct pink color, PFOS producing an orange&#8208;red response, and SDS showing negligible color change. This selectivity stems from variable conformational changes in the PT32 backbone (e.g., random aggregation, extended conformation, and supramolecular aggregation), which are driven by synergistic electrostatic, fluorophilic, and hydrophobic interactions. The PT32 probe exhibited remarkably LOD of 41.61&#160;nM for PFOA and 25.71&#160;nM for PFOS in fluorescence&#8208;based detection and achieved excellent recovery rates in real sample tests. Interestingly, the probe could be recycled post&#8208;detection and use multiple times. Hence, the side&#8208;chain engineering strategy not only addresses long&#8208;standing challenges in discrimination but also establishes a versatile design principle for developing advanced molecular probes.

         <title>Suppressing Alkyl Ammonium Deprotonation with Low&#8208;pKa Solvent for Reproduceable and Stable High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;pKa hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) was introduced as solvent to replace isopropanol (IPA) for passivators. HFIP possesses a weaker proton&#8208;donating ability rather than proton&#8208;acceptation ability compared to IPA, reducing the possibility of deprotonation of ammonium salts (R&#8208;NH3+) to amines (R&#8208;NH2). Finally, the perovskite solar cell with HFIP/PDAI treatment achieved an efficiency of 26.91% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability








Abstract
Various passivation strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the chemical stability of passivators has received limited attention. This study investigates replacing conventional isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent for depositing passivation layers on perovskite films, offering a novel approach to minimizing defects and improving photovoltaic performance. The unique properties of HFIP, particularly its low pKa and strong proton&#8208;donating ability, effectively inhibit the deprotonation of organic ammonia salts. As a result, the HFIP&#8208;based passivation solution exhibits enhanced chemical stability, leading to highly reproducible PSCs fabrication. Additionally, perovskite films treated with the HFIP passivation solution demonstrate higher photoluminescence (PL) intensity and longer carrier lifetimes. Consequently, PSCs treated with HFIP&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dihydroiodide (PDAI) solution achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.91% (certified PCE of 26.88%) and maintained 95.9% of their initial efficiency under operational conditions for 1000 h.

         <dc:description>
The aluminum&#8211;zinc hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (AZ&#8208;HAB) is a novel low&#8208;temperature rechargeable battery. It features a redesigned dual&#8208;electrode system, incorporating an Al@Zn composite anode and replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This design enables rapid charging, low overpotential, and high&#8208;rate cycling stability under extreme cold conditions (&#8211;20 &#176;C to &#8211;40 &#176;C), offering a viable high&#8208;performance solution for energy storage in cold regions.








Abstract
The need for reliable power sources in cold environments drives the development of efficient low&#8208;temperature batteries. While zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are promising due to low cost, high safety, and environmental compatibility, their performance at low temperatures is limited by sluggish kinetics. Here, we report an aluminum&#8208;zinc hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (AZ&#8208;HAB) that overcomes this limitation through a synergistic redesign of both electrodes. At the cathode, the kinetically favorable hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) replaces the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reducing the charging potential and enhancing high&#8208;rate performance at low temperatures. The anode uses a composite structure (Al@Zn) with Zn pre&#8208;deposited on Al, leveraging Al's high activity and low deposition overpotential. This design reduces the full&#8208;cell resistance to one&#8208;third that of bare Zn, promotes uniform Zn deposition, and lowers polarization by 200&#160;mV at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The synergistic effect of both electrodes accelerates reaction kinetics, enabling an 11&#8208;fold longer cycle life than conventional ZABs at&#160;&#8722;20 &#176;C. This work presents a viable strategy for high&#8208;performance energy storage and electric vehicles in extremely cold environments.

Mass spectrometric mapping of target and non&#8208;target products in the formose reaction network was achieved using van Krevelen diagrams and Kendrick mass defect plots. The developed visualization framework offers a powerful means to guide rational strategies for reaction control.








Abstract
A chemical reaction network (CRN) can generate complex molecules from simple starting materials through multiple interconnected reactions. The formose reaction, which produces monosaccharides from formaldehyde (HCHO), is a prototypical non&#8208;enzymatic CRN. Although more than half of the feedstock in this reaction is converted into non&#8208;target products (products other than the target monosaccharides), traditionally referred to as &#8220;tar,&#8221; the compositional evolution of these products has remained unexplored. In this study, we visualized the formose reaction's compositional landscape (target and non&#8208;target products) by applying van Krevelen (VK) diagrams and Kendrick mass defect (KMD) plots using data from high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, enabling comprehensive visualization of the products' composition without structural identification of individual compounds. Under NaOH catalysis, various side reactions proceeded with low selectivity, leading to a wide variety of non&#8208;target products, whereas under Ca(OH)2 catalysis, dehydration&#8208;type side reactions became predominant in the later stages. These findings reveal that the product distribution in the formose reaction is highly catalyst&#8208; and stage&#8208;dependent. The developed visualization framework provides a powerful tool for understanding complex CRNs and suggests rational strategies for reaction control, such as suppressing dehydration to improve the yield of target products in the presence of Ca(OH)2 catalyst.

         <title>Single Halide Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Mn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single halide electrolytes were proposed at the first time with reversible Mn plating&#8208;stripping. The optimized MnBr2 electrolyte displays superior Mn plating&#8208;stripping stability with &#8764;100% efficiency under 1&#8211;50 mAh cm&#8722;2, supported by [MnBrx]2&#8722;x solvates. When paring Mn anode with organic host, activated carbon and Br&#8722;/Br0 cathodes, high&#8208;performance MMBs were demonstrated with long cycling life (&gt;2000 cycles) and high voltage (1.6&#160;V).








Abstract
Rechargeable manganese (Mn) batteries have risen as a highly promising battery technology for sustainable energy storage due to rich abundance, high capacity and low working potential of Mn metal. The key challenge lies at developing advanced Mn&#8208;based electrolyte ensuring reversible Mn plating/stripping. Herein, we report new Mn electrolytes based on low&#8208;cost single halide (MnBr2 or MnCl2), relative to the benchmark hybrid system (MnCl2&#8208;AlCl3&#8208;Mn(TFSI)2; TFSI&#160;=&#160;bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide), for high&#8208;performance Mn metal batteries (MMBs). In the optimized solvent system, for instance, MnBr2 dissociates as various solvated [MnBrx]2&#8722;x (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;4) ions with assistance of triethyl phosphate. No passivation layer is formed on Mn anode owing to non&#8208;reducibility of Br&#8722;. The MnBr2 electrolyte displays superior Mn plating/stripping stability (&gt;1300&#160;h) with near integer Coulombic efficiency under practical areal capacities of 1&#8211;50 mAh cm&#8722;2. The overpotential is suppressed as low as &lt;200&#160;mV at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When paring the Mn metal anode with different cathodes like organic Mn2+ hosts, activated carbon and even a Br&#8722;/Br0 conversion cathode, high&#8208;performance MMBs have been demonstrated with long cycling life (&gt;2000 cycles) and high voltage (1.6&#160;V). Our work represents a brand&#8208;new electrolyte design concept for advanced MMBs and can be readily expanded to other multivalent metal batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Diastereoselective Dearomative Dialkylation of Indoles with Two Different Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed dearomative dialkylation of indoles with two distinct alkyl halides via three component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling under mild conditions. The catalytic protocol offers a route for the modular assembly of diverse carbon quaternary center&#8208;containing dialkylated indoline derivatives with a broad substrate scope, great functional group tolerance and high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.








Abstract
The catalytic dearomative dicarbofunctionalization of indoles constitutes one of the most efficient ways to access poly&#8208;substituted indolines that are prevalent in many natural products and drugs. However, despite significant advances, three component dearomative dicarbofunctionalization of indoles has remained elusive. Herein, we report an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed dearomative dialkylation of indoles with two different alkyl halides via three component cross&#8208;electrophile coupling under mild conditions with the construction of two vicinal C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds at C2 and C3 sites. The catalytic protocol offers an efficient and straightforward route for the modular assembly of diverse carbon quaternary center&#8208;containing dialkylated indoline derivatives with a broad substrate scope (75 examples), excellent functional group tolerance and high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies, combining a series of experiments and DFT calculations, reveal that the catalytic reaction proceeds via a radical pathway.

         <title>A General Reverse Micelle&#8208;Confined Strategy for the Facile Synthesis of 2D Conjugated MOF Colloids with Good Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer a reverse micelle&#8208;confined strategy for facile and scale&#8208;up synthesis of 2D conjugated MOF colloids. Considering the broad light absorption and excellent stability, Cu&#8208;HHTP colloids achieve a photothermal conversion efficiency of 80.3% and enable nearly 100% conversion of CEES into non&#8208;toxic sulfoxide under visible light. This work enables the applications of 2D c&#8208;MOF colloids in catalysis and beyond. 








Abstract
Micelle&#8208;confined synthesis is a well&#8208;established bottom&#8208;up strategy for nanomaterials synthesis, offering precise synthetic control and inherent dispersibility in solution. Herein, we pioneer a reverse micelle&#8208;confined growth strategy for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) colloids, including Cu/Zn/Mn&#8208;HHTP. And scalable synthesis under mild conditions is also achieved. The confined space of micelle microenvironment effectively regulates the growth kinetics and stacking morphology, yielding nanoscale 2D c&#8208;MOFs in minutes that form stable colloids in various solvents for over 20 days. Considering the efficient visible&#8208;near infrared absorption in addition to the strong light&#8208;matter interactions of the 2D c&#8208;MOF colloids, an exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency of 80.3% is achieved under 880&#160;nm laser irradiation, which outperforms most other 2D photothermal materials. Leveraging this, the material served as an efficient catalyst toward the selective oxidation of a chemical warfare agent simulant (i.e., 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, CEES) under visible light, reaching near 100% yield to non&#8208;toxic sulfoxide with extremely low 2D c&#8208;MOFs usage. Our work highlights that micelle&#8208;confined synthesis serves as an efficient, energy&#8208;saving, and green strategy for fabricating 2D c&#8208;MOF colloids, paving the way for their applications in catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Harnessing the Magic Methyl Effect: Manipulating Photoluminescence and Photochromism of Salicylaldehyde Benzoylhydrazones in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is presented to manipulate the solid&#8208;state photoresponse of salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones, achieving a transition from excitation&#8208;dependent emission to photochromism through magic methyl substitution. It arises from twisted molecular conformation and reduced intermolecular stacking. This work highlights molecular engineering as a powerful strategy for creating advanced solid&#8208;state photoresponsive materials.








Abstract
Photoluminescence and photochromism are pivotal in developing solid&#8208;state photoresponsive materials, yet achieving precise tuning through subtle molecular structure modifications remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a universal &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; strategy to effectively manipulate the photoluminescence and photochromism of salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones in the solid state. Interestingly, the In (n =&#160;1&#8211;4) series exhibits weak photochromism but excitation&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) emission with green fluorescence (cis&#8208;keto) and cyan fluorescence (excimer), an exceptional phenomenon to Kasha's rule. More importantly, by replacing the hydrogen atom in the &#9472;NHCO&#9472; group with a methyl group, the obtained IIn (n =&#160;1&#8211;4) series displays quenched fluorescence but pronounced photochromism. This subtle structural modification allows IIn series to reversibly switch the powder colors between white and orange under 365 and 520&#160;nm light irradiation within seconds.

     alt="Harnessing the Magic Methyl Effect: Manipulating Photoluminescence and Photochromism of Salicylaldehyde Benzoylhydrazones in the Solid State"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal strategy is presented to manipulate the solid-state photoresponse of salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones, achieving a transition from excitation-dependent emission to photochromism through magic methyl substitution. It arises from twisted molecular conformation and reduced intermolecular stacking. This work highlights molecular engineering as a powerful strategy for creating advanced solid-state photoresponsive materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoluminescence and photochromism are pivotal in developing solid-state photoresponsive materials, yet achieving precise tuning through subtle molecular structure modifications remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a universal &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; strategy to effectively manipulate the photoluminescence and photochromism of salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazones in the solid state. Interestingly, the &lt;b&gt;In&lt;/b&gt; (n =&#160;1&#8211;4) series exhibits weak photochromism but excitation-dependent (Ex-De) emission with green fluorescence (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-keto) and cyan fluorescence (excimer), an exceptional phenomenon to Kasha's rule. More importantly, by replacing the hydrogen atom in the &#9472;NHCO&#9472; group with a methyl group, the obtained &lt;b&gt;IIn&lt;/b&gt; (n =&#160;1&#8211;4) series displays quenched fluorescence but pronounced photochromism. This subtle structural modification allows &lt;b&gt;IIn&lt;/b&gt; series to reversibly switch the powder colors between white and orange under 365 and 520&#160;nm light irradiation within seconds. The photochromic behavior persists from ambient temperature to -193&#160;&#176;C across different substituents. Notably, compound &lt;b&gt;II3&lt;/b&gt;, featuring a fluorine substituent, exhibits an exceptionally long half-life of &#8764;240&#160;min for its out-of-equilibrium &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-keto tautomer, attributed to intramolecular hydrogen bonding from &#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;HN&#9472; within this form. These exceptional photophysical properties suggest promising applications in anti-counterfeiting, smart coatings, and encrypted information storage, providing insightful strategies for developing organic small molecule based solid-state photoresponsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization of Hydrofluoroolefin 2,3,3,3&#8208;Tetrafluroropropene (R1234yf) via Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled radical copolymerization of hydrofluoroolefin (R1234yf) was established via oxidative quenching by developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence catalysts, enabling on&#8208;demand structural regulation with various functional comonomers (vinyl esters/amides) at ppm&#8208;level catalyst loading. Obtained copolymers presented outstanding behavior as superhydrophobic coatings on diverse surfaces and surfactants in emulsion polymerization. 








Abstract
The transformation of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) into value&#8208;added materials represents an important strategy for sustainable fluorocarbon utilization. Here, we designed a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) photocatalyst based on 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzonitrile core, which has presented high reduction potential (&#8722;1.86&#160;V versus SCE), prolonged lifetime (&#964;TADF&#160;=&#160;31.02 &#181;s) and high quantum yield after excitation. The TADF catalyst facilitated oxidative quenching with a xanthate chain&#8208;transfer agent, enabling visible&#8208;light controlled radical copolymerization of 2,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene (R1234yf) at ppm levels of catalyst usage under ambient conditions. The copolymerization furnished good control across various unconjugated comonomers (vinyl esters, vinyl amides), yielding HFO&#8208;embedded chains with tunable molecular weights, controlled dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Furthermore, this versatile synthetic approach promoted on&#8208;demand construction of complex block architectures through chain&#8208;extension polymerization. After hydrolysis, the obtained amphiphilic chains exhibited outstanding performance as superhydrophobic coatings on diverse substrates, and surfactants in emulsion polymerization, supporting practical potentials of HFO&#8208;based copolymers. This work establishes a versatile platform to access well&#8208;defined R1234yf copolymers, creating opportunities to address both HFO&#8208;transformation concern and growing demand for high&#8208;performance fluoropolymers.

         <title>Optimal Host&#8211;Guest Fit in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Achieve Record C2H2 Packing Density for Trace Acetylene Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our study of the C2H2 adsorption of a series of pillared&#8208;layer MOFs, including CPL&#8208;1, ZU&#8208;901 and newly synthesized SXU&#8208;10, the unusual steep rise&#8208;to&#8208;saturation sorption isotherms at very low pressure regions have been rationalized to originate from elevated degree of host&#8211;guest shape fit, improving trace C2H2 uptake performances.








Abstract
Host&#8211;guest fit is critical in enzyme&#8208;substrate binding and useful for designing crystalline porous adsorbents to remove trace impurities; however, realization of such remains highly scarce, let alone to elucidate the atomic&#8208;level understanding on how to optimize such an effect. Herein, we demonstrate the systematic design of a pillared&#8208;layer MOF series (CPL&#8208;1) to achieve optimal host&#8211;guest fit through increasing the number of bulky groups, progressively enhancing the C2H2 adsorption performance. The newly synthesized, best&#8208;fit SXU&#8208;10 exhibits the most superior very&#8208;low&#8208;pressure C2H2 capture&#8212;reaching near saturation at just 2&#160;kPa. With record C2H2 packing densities of 483.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;kPa and 733.97&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at 100&#160;kPa, SXU&#8208;10 exhibits an uptake of 1.18&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 C2H2 at 1&#160;kPa and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity of 133 for 1/99 C2H2/C2H4 mixtures (all at 298&#160;K), along with exceptional stability and humidity tolerance, enabling the production of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from trace C2H2 mixtures under a challenging humid condition (80% RH). The unusual steep&#8208;rise&#8208;uptake phenomenon and significantly improved performance are attributed to the optimized host&#8211;guest shape fit at a sub&#8208;&#229;ngstr&#246;m precision which constrains the gate&#8208;opening flexibility, evidenced via in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The present study sheds light on the molecular&#8208;level engineering of bioinspired porous adaptive materials.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Island&#8208;Sea Structured Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Enables Cascade Defluorination of PFAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;island&#8208;sea&#8221; structured Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis system is designed by embedding atomically dispersed Cu&#9472;N4 islands within a piezoelectric PVDF matrix. This architecture enables directional electron transfer from the polymer sea to the catalytic islands, driven by a robust interfacial electric field. The resulting localized charge accumulation facilitates efficient oxygen activation and promotes the cascade defluorination of persistent PFAS under ultrasonic excitation.








Abstract
The exceptional stability of C&#9472;F bonds in per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) impedes their activation and degradation through conventional redox processes. Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) offers an oxidant&#8208;free alternative but suffers from uncontrolled electronic structures and non&#8208;directional electron transfer. Here, we design an &#8220;island&#8211;sea&#8221; structured CEC system by embedding atomically dispersed Cu&#9472;N4 islands within a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix. The Cu&#9472;N4 domains trigger interfacial electron transfer that induces &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization of PVDF. The aligned dipoles amplify piezoelectric polarization and strengthen interfacial electric fields (IEFs). This configuration enables efficient electron harvesting from interfacial water and field&#8208;emission&#8208;driven injection into Cu&#9472;N4 sites. The electron&#8208;enriched Cu sites activate O2 to form &#8226;O2&#8722; for nucleophilic defluorination while simultaneously populating the C&#9472;F &#963;* orbitals to facilitate bond cleavage. In parallel, &#8226;OH and 1O2 promote oxidative mineralization of low&#8208;fluorinated intermediates, establishing a cascade redox pathway. This cooperative mechanism achieves 95% degradation and 94.4% defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid with excellent stability. This study defines &#946;&#8208;phase&#8208;mediated IEF engineering in polymer/single&#8208;atom hybrids as a general concept for directing interfacial electron dynamics in catalytic systems.

         <dc:description>
Enclosed is a copper&#8208;catalyzed selective 1,4&#8208;amino oxgenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with the presence of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. This three&#8208;component transformation offers a novel and powerful approach to construct (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;allylic amino oxygenated motifs by the simultaneous installation of structurally diverse alkylamines and alcohols directly onto 1,3&#8208;dienes.








Abstract
Multicomponent difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has emerged as a promising strategy for rapid synthesis of valuable allylic compounds. Here, we report an unprecedented three&#8208;component 1,4&#8208;amino oxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes, enabled by copper catalysis and strong Br&#248;nsted acid. The reaction engages a novel mechanism that merges umpolung electrophilic amination via copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed formation of aminium radical cations and copper (II)&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;oxygen bond formation&#160;with alcohols. The observed 1,4&#8208;selectivity is modulated by noncovalent interactions of aminated allylic intermediates. This method presents broad synthetic utility and offers a rapid entry to (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;allylic amino ethers, which can be derivatized into various polyfunctional molecules with high stereocontrol.

         <title>A Biocatalytic Platform for the Synthesis of Organofunctional Silanes and Siloxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofunctional silanes are valuable in materials science as crosslinkers and adhesion promoters, but their synthesis typically requires costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts. We developed a sustainable biocatalytic platform for enantioselective synthesis of ester&#8208; and cyano&#8208;functionalized silanes. Directed evolution of Thermus amyloliquefaciens protoglobin (TamPgb) yielded enzymes that cyclopropanate vinyl silanes/siloxanes with diazo compounds or N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as carbene precursors (up to 2500 TTN, &gt;99% dr/ee). This safer, practical method avoids precious metals and simplifies purification.








Abstract
Organofunctional silanes are highly useful reagents in material science, functioning as effective crosslinking agents and adhesion promoters. Traditionally, their synthesis relies on precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts, which require downstream purification and increase overall costs. Herein, we present a green and sustainable biocatalytic platform for the enantioselective synthesis of diverse organofunctional silanes bearing ester and cyano groups. Directed evolution of Thermus amyloliquefaciens protoglobin (TamPgb) produced efficient enzymes for cyclopropanation of vinyl silanes and siloxanes using diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones as carbene precursors with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (up to 2500 TTN, &gt;99% dr, &gt;99% ee). Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that N&#8208;tosylhydrazones can serve as carbene precursors in enzymatic reactions, providing a safer and more practical alternative for industrial applications.

         <title>Semiconducting Borophene Realized via Hydrogenation&#8208;Driven Structural Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical predictions identify a stable semiconducting semi&#8208;hydrogenated &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4 with hydrogenation&#8208;induced structural reconstruction. Guided by this theory, we synthesized &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4, validated by structural characterization, spectral measurement, and first&#8208;principles simulations. Additionally, this phase exhibits good air and chemical stability. This combined theory&#8211;experiment study identifies an air&#8208;stable semiconducting borophene phase for nanoelectroic and ooptoelectric applications.








Abstract
Hydrogenation provides a robust approach to both dramatically improve borophene's ambient stability and induce semiconducting behavior&#8212;two essential requirements for its integration into nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the vast configurational diversity of hydrogen adsorption patterns impedes the identification of a definitive semiconducting hydrogenated borophene phase. In this work, we conducted systematic high&#8208;throughput searches to investigate various hydrogen coverages on &#945;&#8242;&#8211;borophene and determined that semi&#8208;hydrogenated configurations constitute the most promising semiconducting candidates. Guided by these predictions, we synthesized semi&#8208;hydrogenated borophene, &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4 via chemical vapor deposition. Subsequent extensive structural characterization and complementary computational simulations provided compelling evidence for the formation of this stable semiconducting phase. In sharp contrast to the previously proposed &#945;&#8242;&#8211;4H model, the synthesized &#945;&#8242;&#8211;B8H4 undergoes hydrogenation&#8208;induced structural reconstruction&#8212;stabilized by both two&#8208;center&#8211;two&#8208;electron B&#8211;H and three&#8208;center&#8211;two&#8208;electron B&#9472;H&#9472;B bonds&#8212;whose ensuing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling drives strong hybridization between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane p orbitals, thereby opening a band gap. This combined theoretical and experimental study identifies an air&#8208;stable semiconducting borophene and paves the way for borophenes as next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Discovery of a First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Covalent Allosteric SHP1 Inhibitor with Immunotherapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent allosteric inhibitor M029 was discovered for SHP1, a novel target for immunotherapy. M029 binds to a cryptic Cys remote from the active site, exhibits robust target engagement, and blocks tumor progression by stimulating&#160;antitumor immune response. The study&#160;identifies a ligandable Cys in SHP1, thus expanding the&#160;toolbox of targeted phosphatase drug discovery.








Abstract
Src homology 2 domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 1 (SHP1), encoded by PTPN6, is a key intracellular mediator of inhibitory immune signals. SHP1 is&#160;garnering attention as a potential immunotherapeutic target since SHP1 deletion elicits strong antitumor activity by boosting both innate and adaptive immunity. Unfortunately, no quality SHP1 inhibitor exists to demonstrate its translatability owing to the challenges posed by the chemistry of the phosphatase active site. Herein, we describe the discovery of a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, phenyl chloroacetamide&#8208;based covalent allosteric SHP1 inhibitor M029 through covalent fragment screening and multiparameter optimization. M029 inactivates SHP1 by covalently binding to a non&#8208;conserved and cryptic Cys480 far away from the active site, thus uncovering a novel allosteric mechanism for SHP1 inhibition. In addition, M029 is highly selective for SHP1 and exhibits robust cellular target engagement. Importantly, M029 is orally active and blocks tumor progression in a syngeneic cancer model by activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, along with reduced T cell exhaustion. Together, this study reveals a ligandable Cys that can be exploited for allosteric inhibition of SHP1, which has been refractory to targeted pharmacologic manipulation. The work also demonstrates small&#8208;molecule SHP1 inhibition as a compelling approach for new cancer immunotherapy.

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved from a structural curiosity into one of the most dynamic areas of modern chemistry. In celebration of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, this Highlight reflects on their remarkable journey and the prospects that lie ahead.








Abstract
The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry celebrates the groundbreaking development of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which revolutionised porous materials through the application of crystallography and reticular chemistry principles. Building on the pioneering contributions of Kitagawa, Robson, and Yaghi, MOF chemistry is now pursued with a level of precision comparable to that long established in molecular chemistry. Looking ahead, the field is exploring dynamic frameworks, defect engineering, and expanding practical applications, all in pursuit of designing high&#8208;performance materials driven by molecular design to meet pressing societal challenges.

Circularly polarized light orchestrates a chiral symphony on Au@CdS nanocatalysts, guiding electrons by the rhythm of handedness. When light and the catalyst share the same chirality, spin&#8208;aligned carriers flow to produce hydrogen photocatalytically. When this harmony is disrupted, recombination converts energy into heat, revealing a photothermal pathway for hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Layered Double Hydroxides as Building Blocks for Precise Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines recent advances in using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their topotactic derivatives as platforms for precise catalysis. By enabling atomic&#8208;level control over active site composition, structure, and interfaces, LDH&#8208;derived catalysts achieve enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in key reactions, including electrocatalysis, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and syngas conversion. 








Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are structurally tunable, 2D materials that serve as versatile precursors for the design of heterogeneous catalysts. Their unique lamellar architecture, topotactic transformation ability, and compositional flexibility enable the fabrication of monometallic, bimetallic, and intermetallic catalysts with atomically controlled active sites. These LDH&#8208;derived catalysts feature high metal dispersion, strong metal&#8211;support interactions, and defect&#8208;rich interfaces, which are key attributes for precise catalysis. Recent advances have demonstrated their broad applicability in electrocatalysis (e.g., oxygen evolution and CO2 reduction), selective hydrogenation, direct and oxidative dehydrogenation, and syngas conversion. Across these reactions, LDH&#8208;derived systems offer enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability by tailoring active site geometry, electronic structure, and interfacial properties. This review summarizes the advances in synthesis, structure&#8211;function relationships, and catalytic applications of LDH&#8208;based catalysts. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in understanding transformation mechanisms, capturing dynamic active sites under working conditions, and establishing predictive design rules. Future efforts combining operando spectroscopy, theory, and data&#8208;driven approaches are expected to unlock the full potential of LDH&#8208;derived materials for precise catalysis in sustainable energy and chemical transformations.

         <title>A Family of Cobalt(II) Complexes Exhibiting Record Dissymmetry Factors in Vibrational Circular Dichroism</title>

Cobalt&#8208;powered VCD boost! A new family of heteroleptic CoII complexes exhibits vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra with exceptional intensity and record dissymmetry values up to g&#160;=&#160;5.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2, with an enhancement of 2 orders of magnitude with respect to the diamagnetic ZnII analogue. This unique phenomenon is due to the coupling between ligand vibrations and CoII d&#8211;d transitions, some of which fall in the IR range.








Abstract
A family of novel chiral cobalt(II) complexes with two diketonate and one bis(oxazoline) ligand, [Co(dkt)2(BOX)], is reported. These complexes exhibit octahedral coordination geometry and feature a chiroptical superspectrum extending from UV to mid&#8208;IR regions. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) enhancement occurs thanks to the coupling between ligand vibrations and low&#8208;lying electronic transitions allied to the distorted octahedral high&#8208;spin CoII d7 core, generating VCD bands of unprecedented intensity in the mid&#8208;IR region with dissymmetry factors up to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 for a VCD peak at 1453&#160;cm&#8722;1 and&#160;&gt;&#160;5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 for its shoulder at 1430&#160;cm&#8722;1. These values correspond to a &#8776;&#160;100&#8208;fold enhancement with respect to the diamagnetic ZnII analog and set a record among non&#8208;aggregated species in solution. The extraordinarily enhanced intensity allows recording a VCD spectrum with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise (S/N) ratio of &#8776;&#160;30 in a single acquisition.

         <title>Aminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling: Tackling Alkyl Nucleophiles and Addressing the Viability of the Electrophile&#8208;First Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed aminative coupling of primary and secondary alkyl boronic esters with aryl (pseudo)halides is reported. DFT calculations and mechanistic experiments show that the first C&#9472;N bond formation may take place through an unusual dyotropic rearrangement of a LPd(Ar)NHX complex (X&#160;=&#160;OPOPh2).








Abstract
Insertive cross&#8208;coupling reactions provide the option of repurposing widely available coupling partners for the formation of new linkages. By confronting a major limitation of the aminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura methods we recently reported, we achieve a general method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aminative coupling of primary and secondary alkyl boronic esters with aryl (pseudo)halides. Introducing a formal nitrene insertion into this Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction diverts the outcome from the traditional C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) products to the C(sp2)&#9472;NH&#9472;C(sp3) analogues (N&#8208;aryl anilines). DFT calculations and experimental mechanistic studies indicate that C&#9472;N bond formation from the electrophilic aryl component occurs first, providing further evidence for this previously hypothetical pathway. By comparison of several transition state structures, we find that C&#9472;N bond formation likely takes place through an unusual dyotropic rearrangement of a LPd(Ar)NHX complex (X&#160;=&#160;OPOPh2).

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;Initiated Addition&#8211;Fragmentation Chain Transfer in Allyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of radical&#8208;based vitrimers employing addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer reactions is reported. The vitrimers synthesized from allylic epoxy is undergoing exchange through a degenerative transfer mechanism. Unlike previous systems that required an external initiator, the generation of thiyl radicals necessary for the exchange is triggered thermally by a disulfide hardener, which reversibly generates radicals upon thermal activation.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have emerged as a promising class of materials that incorporate dynamic covalent bonds, enabling reprocessability and recyclability while retaining the advantageous properties of traditional thermosets. Herein, we report a class of radical&#8208;based vitrimers employing addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer reactions. The vitrimer was synthesized via crosslinking of an epoxy monomer containing embedded allylic functionalities capable of undergoing exchange through a degenerative transfer mechanism. The generation of thiyl radicals necessary for the exchange is triggered by a disulfide&#8208;containing hardener which reversibly generates radicals upon thermal activation. Vitrimers were prepared with varying proportions of the disulfide hardener relative to a permanent hardener. All materials exhibited stress relaxation, with relaxation times dependent on the disulfide content. Incorporation of only 10&#160;mol% of disulfide resulted in a relaxation time of 21&#160;min at 200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating dynamic behavior. Full reversibility was confirmed after three reprocessing cycles, with no significant change in glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, and FTIR spectra. Additionally, a model reaction was conducted to prove the exchange mechanism, revealing an activation energy in the range of 48&#160;(&#177;&#160;4)&#160;kJ.mol&#8722;1. This study introduces a novel approach to thermally activated, radical&#8208;based vitrimers, expanding the design for recyclable thermoset materials.

         <title>Rapid and Reversible Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Helix Inversion in Chiral Liquid Crystals Doped with a Negative Photochromic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that a binaphthyl&#8208;bridged imidazole dimer&#8208;based chiral dopant enables extremely rapid, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, and fully reversible helix inversion within seconds. We also identified the second&#8208;stage inversion that was irreversible and triggered by light&#8208;induced protonation of the dopant. These findings highlight a new molecular design for engineering multistage chirality switching materials.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced helix inversion in chiral nematic liquid crystals (N*LCs), where helicity reverses under photoirradiation, has emerged as a promising strategy. However, existing systems often suffer from slow response times and limited reversibility, primarily due to inefficient photoisomerization. Here we report a binaphthyl&#8208;bridged imidazole dimer (BN&#8208;ImD) as a negative photochromic chiral dopant that enables rapid, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, and fully reversible helix inversion in N*LCs within seconds. BN&#8208;ImD undergoes efficient isomerization between a stable colored and metastable colorless form with a large dihedral angle change in the binaphthyl unit, while operating efficiently even in solid films and exhibiting fast thermal back reaction at room temperature. We also identified a second&#8208;stage, irreversible helix inversion triggered by protonation of the dopant under high&#8208;intensity irradiation, demonstrating a sequential helicity inversion that proceeds through two mechanistically distinct switching pathways of the chiral dopant. These findings highlight a new molecular design strategy for engineering multistage, light&#8208;controlled chirality in photoresponsive materials.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Templated In Situ Growth of Centimeter&#8208;Scale Perovskite Nanocrystal Arrays with Ultrasmall Pixel Size and High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the polymer&#8208;templated in&#8208;situ growth strategy for non&#8208;destructive patterning of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). This strategy enables the centimeter scale fabrication of PNC nanopatterns with ultrasmall pixel size (down to &#8764;60 nm), high resolution (59325 PPI) and high environmental stability, which is potential for the application of X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Miniaturizing the perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) pattern is critical for advancing integrated chip&#8208;level devices and next&#8208;generation displays. However, scalable fabrication of nanoscale PNC patterns remains challenging. In this study, we report a polymer&#8208;templated in situ growth strategy for fabricating centimeter&#8208;scale PNC arrays with ultrasmall pixel size and excellent environmental stability. The method involves the use of nanoimprinting soft lithography to generate crosslinked polymer arrays, and subsequent selective nucleation and growth of PNCs within the polymeric nanodomains. The PNC&#8208;loaded nanoarrays achieve a pixel resolution of 59&#160;325&#160;ppi. By varying the dimension of polymeric nanocylinders, the pixel size of nanoarrays can be precisely tuned from 167.8 to 64.5&#160;nm, breaking the limit of pixel size reported so far. Furthermore, the nanoarrays exhibit exceptional stability, retaining 91.8% of their initial photoluminescence (PL) intensity after immersion in water for over 1000&#160;h. They also preserve 86% of their initial PL intensity after 10 thermal treatment cycles between 30 and 100&#160;&#176;C, and nearly 100% after 6.5&#160;h of UV light irradiation. Finally, we demonstrate the application of PNC nanoarrays as scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging. This study presents a simple yet effective approach for the scalable production of robust perovskite nanocrystal arrays with potential in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation of Carbazoles by Cooperative Potassium&#8208;Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Aryloxide Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation of carbazoles to construct fully substituted stereocenters was achieved using indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones as alkylating agents via a cooperative catalytic system. An in situ generated polyfunctional potassium catalyst, featuring Lewis acidic, Br&#248;nsted basic, and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating sites, enables efficient amination with broad scope and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric N&#8208;alkylation of carbazoles to construct fully substituted stereocenters remains a significant challenge due to issues of regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, and steric hindrance. In this work, we address these obstacles by employing indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones as suitable electrophilic partners in a cooperative catalytic system. An in situ generated polyfunctional potassium catalyst, integrating Lewis acidic, Br&#248;nsted basic, and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating sites, effectively promotes the nucleophilic amination process, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and excellent selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that coordination of the carbonyl group in indol&#8208;2&#8208;ones to the potassium center is critical for lowering the activation barrier, while both the naphthalenolate and the naphthol moiety in the catalyst facilitate proton transfer. The resulting enantioenriched carbazole&#8211;oxindole hybrids, featuring two privileged scaffolds, may hold promising potential for medicinal chemistry applications.

     alt="Asymmetric N-alkylation of Carbazoles by Cooperative Potassium-Hydrogen-Bond-Aryloxide Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic asymmetric N-alkylation of carbazoles to construct fully substituted stereocenters was achieved using indol-2-ones as alkylating agents via a cooperative catalytic system. An in situ generated polyfunctional potassium catalyst, featuring Lewis acidic, Br&#248;nsted basic, and hydrogen-bond-donating sites, enables efficient amination with broad scope and excellent selectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic asymmetric N-alkylation of carbazoles to construct fully substituted stereocenters remains a significant challenge due to issues of regioselectivity, enantioselectivity, and steric hindrance. In this work, we address these obstacles by employing indol-2-ones as suitable electrophilic partners in a cooperative catalytic system. An in situ generated polyfunctional potassium catalyst, integrating Lewis acidic, Br&#248;nsted basic, and hydrogen-bond-donating sites, effectively promotes the nucleophilic amination process, exhibiting broad functional group tolerance and excellent selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that coordination of the carbonyl group in indol-2-ones to the potassium center is critical for lowering the activation barrier, while both the naphthalenolate and the naphthol moiety in the catalyst facilitate proton transfer. The resulting enantioenriched carbazole&#8211;oxindole hybrids, featuring two privileged scaffolds, may hold promising potential for medicinal chemistry applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Unactivated Alkenes with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of nonactivated alkenes with simple amines, through Co(III)H&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer followed by a nucleophilic amination of alkylcobalt(IV), was developed, enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in high yields and enantioselectivities. 








Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed direct enantioselective addition of N&#9472;H bonds to unactivated alkenes is of great significance as it creates high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral alkylamines from two abundant chemical feedstocks, yet it has long been a considerable challenge. Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements rely on the use of olefins with a tethered heteroatom or heteroaromatic amine, which can readily coordinate with metal catalysts to achieve high stereoselectivity. Herein, we report a photoredox/cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of nonactivated alkenes with simple amines through Co(III)H&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer followed by a nucleophilic amination of alkylcobalt(IV), enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in high yields and enantioselectivities. The strategy demonstrates a unique capability to control enantioselectivity of the in situ generated alkyl radicals, efficiently differentiating two alkyl substituents (methyl versus methylene), which is significantly less explored in enantioselective radical transformation. This research will spark new ideas for the asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes with various nucleophiles.

         <title>Nucleophilic Oxygen&#8208;Engineering Dual&#8208;Gradient Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese Oxide Cathodes</title>

LiBOB nucleophilically attacks LiPF6, resulting in the formation of LiPO2F2. Compared to LiBOB, LiPO2F2 exhibits lower charge density and nucleophilicity, leading to a lower HOMO level and a slower oxidation&#8208;decomposition sequence than LiBOB. This sequential decomposition behavior facilitates the formation of a CEI with a dual&#8208;gradient component distribution, which stabilizes the interphase of the LRMO cathode under high cutoff voltage, suppresses electrolyte decomposition, maintains the lattice structure, and inhibits transition metal dissolution.








Abstract
The high&#8208;voltage stability of lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxide (LRMO), particularly at voltages approaching 4.8&#160;V, is governed by the structure of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), the oxidative stability of the electrolyte, and lattice degradation caused by transition metals dissolution. In this work, a molecular engineering strategy is employed to design nucleophilic oxygen&#8208;functionalized additives that construct a dual&#8208;gradient inorganic CEI, effectively modulate interfacial redox reactions, and stabilize the lattice Mn dissolution of the LRMO cathode. Driven by the strong electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the nucleophilic species, the engineered CEI exhibits a robust and zipper&#8208;like architecture composed of an inner lithium borates&#8208;rich layer and an outer lithium phosphates&#8208;dominated layer, promoting fast Li+ transport and enhancing interfacial kinetics. The nucleophilic oxygen&#8208;driven electrolyte mitigates oxidative degradation and suppresses Mn dissolution, enabling LRMO cathodes to exhibit a reversible capacity retention of 80% after 580 cycles at a high&#8208;voltage of 4.8&#160;V&#8208;class. This work provides the efficiency of nucleophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering in enabling durable high&#8208;voltage operation of LRMO cathodes.

         <title>Topology&#8208;Tuned Structural Flexibility Toward Customized Piezofluorochromism in Stable Zirconium MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular chemistry offers tunable piezofluorochromic behaviors of MOFs based on different topologies. The flexible scu&#8208;MOFs demonstrate higher pressure&#8208;responsive sensitivity in photoluminescence redshift, while their rigid csq&#8208;topology counterparts possess rare instances of pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement.








Abstract
Albeit serving important roles in high&#8208;techs, the rapid development of crystalline pressure&#8208;responsive materials still heavily relied on the de novo synthesis. Regarding pressure&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), their fascinating designability on the metal/ligand component has been extensively utilized, but yet for their network or topology tunability. Derived from the reticular chemistry, we, herein, present a distinctive exploration toward altered piezofluorochromic behaviors of highly&#8208;stable MOFs under GPa&#8208;level, of which is highly topology&#8208;focused. Specifically, each of the three selected organic ligand have yielded its corresponding zirconium&#8208;MOFs under csq&#8208; and scu&#8208;topology, whom all possessed well&#8208;behaved, reversible pressure&#8208;altered photoluminescence (PL). Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the intrinsic network flexibility of scu&#8208;topology rendered the MOFs with larger PL response sensitivity, while the relatively rigid csq&#8208;topology could induce the rarely&#8208;reported pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE). This observed topology&#8208;dependent piezofluorochromism regulation proactively establishes a novel structure&#8208;property relationship in crystalline piezofluorochromic materials, while also spearheads a new horizon for customized smart pressure sensors and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Microenvironmental Regulation of Fe&#9472;N4 Catalytic Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Electrochemical Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino&#8208;fluorinated cyclotriphosphazene is designed and synthesized to regulate the microenvironment around the Fe&#9472;N4 sites in polyphthalocyanines. Due to the large steric hindrance and hierarchical functional groups, the mass&#8208;transfer networks of oxygen and ions are established for accelerating oxygen reduction reaction. This microenvironment effect brings higher device performance in either aqueous Zn&#8208;air batteries or alkaline membrane fuel cells. 








Abstract
The non&#8208;metallic&#8208;Pt materials with high activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have attracted considerable attentions, but still face challenges related to the mismatched performance in device applications, especially for the atomic site catalysts. In this work, we propose a microenvironment&#8208;regulation strategy on introducing amino&#8208;fluorinated cyclotriphosphazene as grafting agents to address the critical issue on the mass&#8208;transfer limitations for the highly active and well&#8208;defined Fe&#9472;N4 sites in phthalocyanine macrocycles. When this functional cyclotriphosphazene was grafted to polyphthalocyanines by the amidate linkage, the large steric hindrance of cyclotriphosphazene and the low surface energy of C&#9472;F bonding in fluorinate groups provide the enriched channels with low hygroscopicity, which guarantees the oxygen supply to Fe&#9472;N4 sites and the hydroxyl leave from catalyst molecules. This microenvironment regulation improves the activities of catalyst molecules in electrochemical testing, and an amplified effect are also shown in the corresponding electrode assemblies. As results, the superior peak power densities of 178&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in aqueous Zn&#8208;air batteries (1.4&#8208;fold enhancements) and 616&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in alkaline membrane fuel cells (2.5&#8208;fold enhancements) are obtained. These findings offer a deeper understanding of non&#8208;Pt catalysts and provide a promising approach to their applications in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Induced Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly for Phosphorescence&#8208;to&#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoexcitation&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly strategy enables in situ transformation from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence within a single molecule, achieving dynamically enhanced, oxygen&#8208;resistant time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging.








Abstract
Phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence are currently two important photophysical pathways that have greatly promoted the development of display, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving in situ conversion of these two photophysical pathways within the same molecule is extremely challenging. In this study, we covalently bond chiral donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor' structures into a photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregated molecule, specifically hexathiobenzene, to achieve this goal through light irradiation. Initially, the target molecules predominantly exhibit phosphorescent properties. Upon photoirradiation, chiral self&#8208;assembly occurs within the target molecules, which gives rise to a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;dominant emission behavior. This TADF emission relies on a self&#8208;assembly structure that can effectively prevent oxygen from quenching triplet excitons, resulting in stronger signal intensity and longer photoluminescence lifetime. Consequently, a real time improvement of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging can be achieved with the utilization of our strategy, rendering selectively dynamic control of imaging parameters at the desired time&#8208; and spatial resolution.

The polar solvent processing steps during p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cell devices fabrication have been shown to induce desorption of weakly adsorbed SAM molecules. To address this, we developed a novel SAM material bearing in situ crosslinking moieties&#8212;4&#8208;(5,9&#8208;diallyl&#8208;7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)butyl phosphonic acid (4PADCB&#8208;V)&#8212;which undergoes polymerization upon UV irradiation. The crosslinked SAM retained structural integrity upon polar solvent exposure, mitigating interfacial defect formation while enhancing charge carrier transport properties and improving perovskite film crystallinity








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in advancing the efficiency and operational stability of p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for scalable manufacturing. However, nonuniform surface coverage and weak interfacial adhesion of SAMs on substrates remain critical bottlenecks for further performance enhancement. The polar solvent processing steps during PSC device fabrication have been shown to induce desorption of weakly adsorbed SAM molecules. To address this, we developed a novel SAM material bearing in situ crosslinking moieties&#8212;4&#8208;(5,9&#8208;diallyl&#8208;7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazol&#8208;7&#8208;yl)butyl phosphonic acid (4PADCB&#8208;V)&#8212;which undergoes rapid polymerization upon UV irradiation. The crosslinked SAM (crs&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;V) retained structural integrity upon polar solvent exposure, mitigating interfacial defect formation while enhancing charge carrier transport properties and improving perovskite film crystallinity. Consequently, crs&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;V&#8208;based devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.46% (certified efficiency of 25.96%) and retained 91% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous illumination.

         <title>Built&#8208;In Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Water Activation for Industrial&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Ethylene from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a BEF@La(OH)3&#8208;Cu electrocatalyst featuring a built&#8208;in electric field, which achieves a record FEC2H4 of 84.2% and high intrinsic activity surpassing 842.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, along with stable operation of 110&#160;h. The built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggered H2O dissociation on La(OH)3&#8208;Cu interface to supply active *H species, facilitating *CO hydrogenation into *COH and enabling efficient asymmetric coupling for C2H4 production.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4), as opposed to traditional industrial methods, stands out as an environmentally friendly benign and promising technical solution for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. Here, we introduce a built&#8208;in electric field in La(OH)3&#8208;Cu (BEF@La(OH)3&#8208;Cu) electrocatalyst that can exclusively convert from CO2 to C2H4 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 84.2% and high intrinsic activity exceeding 842.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, while maintaining robust stability of 110&#160;h. Furthermore, the corresponding C2H4 formation rate and energy efficiency can reach 2618.0&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and 31.2%, respectively. The BEF@La(OH)3&#8208;Cu electrocatalyst was constructed by stacking La(OH)3 and Cu layers, forming a built&#8208;in electric field induced by electron transfer between La&#8594;O&#8592;Cu. The electric field effectively triggered H2O dissociation on La(OH)3&#8208;Cu interface for supplying active hydrogen (*H) species, which promoted multiple protonation steps in the process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion. The *H species then easily migrate to Cu sites, reducing the energy barrier for the conversion from *CO to *COH, thus enhancing the efficient asymmetric *CO&#8722;*COH coupling and ultimately boosting the C2H4 production under ampere&#8208;level operation.

         <title>Multi&#8208;site Relay Catalysts with Regulating Intrinsic Activity of each Functional Site for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi &#8208;site relay catalysts of Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF are rationally designed and constructed, where the electron&#8208;deficient Fe7C3 can accelerate water dissociation, and the resulting protons can rapidly migrate from Fe7C3 to Ru. The Ru sites with moderate H* adsorption energy facilitate hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Ruthenium is emerging as a promising catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis. However, the high energy barrier for water dissociation and inappropriate hydrogen adsorption energy often hinders their catalytic efficiency. To address these challenges, Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF with abundant twin boundaries has been rationally designed based on synergistic relay catalysis principles. Experimental results combined with mechanistic analysis demonstrate that the electron&#8208;deficient Fe7C3 can accelerate water dissociation, and the resulting protons can rapidly spill over to Ru due to a smaller work function difference, subsequently, the Ru with moderate &#916;GH* facilitates hydrogen evolution. Notably, Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF with twin&#8208;boundary defects and charge redistribution induced by the heterointerface optimizes the adsorption energy and enhances the intrinsic activity of each functional site. As expected, this catalyst exhibits enhanced HER performance that is superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the assembled anion exchange membrane water electrolysis utilizing Ru&#8208;Fe7C3@CNF//NiFe LDH operates at a voltage of 1.67&#160;V at a current density of 0.5 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains remarkable stability over 300&#160;h. This work offers a valuable strategy for the rational design of multisite electrocatalysts.

         <title>&#8220;Living Nanosheets&#8221; of Covalent Organic Frameworks Aligned into Laminar Membranes for Sharp and Durable Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;living nanosheets&#8221; strategy is proposed to prepare a robust and laminar COF membrane with a large area of up to 600 cm2. The resultant COF membrane exhibits fast methanol permeation and sharp molecular weight cutoff, enabling energy&#8208;efficient molecular separations in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.








Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) requires membranes to have exquisite pore structures and excellent solvent resistance to alter energy&#8208;intensive separation processes. Here, we report a scalable &#8220;living nanosheet&#8221; strategy for synthesizing covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with robust laminar structures. COF nanosheets and residual monomers are collectively cast onto smooth substrates, followed by heating in an enclosed environment. The slow shear&#8208;flows make COF nanosheets accurately aligned into laminar structures while avoiding possible distortion. The COF nanosheets are still &#8220;living&#8221;, so that they can continue to react with remaining monomers upon heating, further healing the intercrystalline defects and stabilizing the laminar membranes. This strategy allows upscalable preparation of membranes with a large area of up to 600 cm2. The resulting COF membranes exhibit ultrahigh permeability (1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 nm for methanol) and a sharp molecular weight cutoff (360&#160;Da), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSN membranes. Notably, it achieves a sharp and durable separation process of photosensitizers (e.g., 98.3% rejection of TMPyP4 tosylate) and&#160;&gt;92% solvent recovery. This work establishes a versatile approach for scalable synthesis of COF membranes, enabling energy&#8208;efficient molecular separations in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

         <title>How Does the Precursor Influence the Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work points out the irrationality in the current selection of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathode precursor routes in academic research and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of cathodes derived from both carbonate and hydroxide precursors. The results reveal that each route offers distinct advantages and drawbacks, with primary&#8208;particle stacking density (PSD) identified as a key factor influencing structural degradation. Meanwhile, modification strategies are proposed and experimentally validated, providing valuable insights and guidance for future advancements in LRLO cathode development.








Abstract
As a fundamental determinant of Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) cathode performance and production scalability/feasibility, selection and optimization of precursors represent an essential challenge for the commercialization of layered oxide cathodes. However, for lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes, the overwhelming majority of laboratory research has rigidly continued to employ carbonate precursors for further modifications while ignoring the potential of hydroxide precursors, which have been undisputedly utilized as commercial precursors for large&#8208;scale production of nickel&#8211;cobalt&#8211;manganese oxide (NCM) cathodes. This bias toward precursor selection seriously impedes the practical application of the LRLO cathode and largely wastes the resources of lab&#8208;scale scientific research. Herein, through comparative analysis, the structure&#8208;property relationship between carbonate precursor&#8208;derived (CO3&#8208;) and hydroxide precursor&#8208;derived (OH&#8208;) LRLO cathodes was established, elucidating the significance of particle architectural features, especially primary&#8208;particle stacking density (PSD). Specifically, the lower PSD of the CO3&#8208;LRLO cathode facilitates Li&#8314; diffusion by enriching the electrolyte&#8208;infiltrated ionic transport pathway but introduces cracks that reduce the volumetric energy density and interfacial/thermal stability. In contrast, the higher PSD of the OH&#8208;LRLO cathode improves structural integrity by enhancing the covalent environment, layered structure, and particle architecture. Moreover, multiple optimization approaches have been proposed and implemented (e.g., electrolyte engineering, lattice doping, and blending strategies) to mitigate inherent drawbacks derived from various precursors.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;[2+2] Cyclization Reaction of Simple Ketoimine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the first catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;[2+2] cyclization of simple ketoimines using magnesium catalyst. This method enables the construction of &#946;&#8208;lactams bearing chiral quaternary carbon centers. Lactam editing of pharmaceutical active molecules and further utilization of the ring&#8208;opening reaction of the obtained lactam for short peptide modification have also been achieved.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first catalytic enantioselective aza&#8208;[2+2] cyclization of simple ketoimines, thereby addressing a persistent challenge in four&#8208;membered aza&#8208;ring construction. While the aza&#8208;[2+2] cyclization represents the most straightforward approach to azetidine synthesis, previous methodologies have been strictly limited to ketoimines, all with an EWG at the central reactive carbon, and predominantly employing cyclic imine substrates. Through rational design of an in situ&#8208;generated magnesium catalytic system and systematic investigation of imine electronic effects, we have successfully developed an asymmetric protocol for simple ketoimines. This breakthrough enables efficient access to enantioenriched monocyclic azetidines with excellent stereocontrol. Moreover, a streamlined one&#8208;pot tandem oxidation readily converts these azetidines into valuable quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams&#8212;privileged scaffolds that are prominent in numerous pharmaceuticals and bioactive agents. A combination of comparative studies, the calculation results of the HOMO and LUMO energies of different imines, relative control experiments, and a series of detailed NLE analysis revealed the coordination difference and the catalytic cycle. The catalytic protocol was used for the synthesis of a series of &#946;&#8208;lactams containing aryl or alkyl groups, as well as for pharmaceutical active molecules&#8217; &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;modifications. Importantly, the preliminary attempt to take advantage of the significant ring strain of &#946;&#8208;lactam for peptide modifications was also achieved on tryptophan.

         <title>CrystalGAT: An AI&#8208;Based Intelligent Flexible Crystal Materials Design Computing Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents CrystalGAT, an attention&#8208;based graph neural network, to predict the mechanical properties of molecular crystals. It visually identifies key structural segments affecting flexibility, enabling targeted modification to transform brittle into flexible crystals and improving drug tablet performance, offering a powerful tool for material and pharmaceutical development.








Abstract
Endowing functional crystals with flexibility significantly broadens their potential applications in the field of flexible smart devices. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the foundational structural principles of flexibility, most discoveries of crystals with mechanical flexibility remain accidental. Currently, machine learning has become a transformative research paradigm in materials science. Here, we propose an innovative approach and develop a platform for predicting the mechanical properties of molecular crystals named CrystalGAT. CrystalGAT is a graph neural network model based on attention mechanisms, which constructs a robust optimal model through data augmentation strategies and achieves markedly superior prediction performance compared to established models. A high prediction accuracy of 90% is demonstrated on the validation set, alongside a promising generalization capability that extends to multicomponent systems. Most importantly, we have identified key segments influencing the mechanical properties of molecular crystals using CrystalGAT, successfully achieving a breakthrough in transforming brittle crystals into flexible photoresponsive crystals. Furthermore, it is possible to quickly screen for plastic multicomponent drug crystals, enhancing tableting performance. CrystalGAT provides an efficient method for flexible molecular crystal design, demonstrating its potential applications in material discovery and drug molecular modification. For user convenience, a dedicated website has been established: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ZZZCCCYYY/CrystalGAT.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Direct Seawater Electrolysis via Redox Mediator for H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis system based on a TQBQ&#8208;COF (Covalent Organic Framework) redox mediator, eliminating the need for desalination and proton exchange membranes (PEMs). The system operates efficiently in real seawater with excellent cycling stability and enables low&#8208;cost hydrogen and chlorine production, meeting the European Commission's green hydrogen target. This scalable approach simplifies system design and supports clean energy transitions, particularly in coastal regions.








Abstract
Acidic seawater electrolysis offers a promising strategy for sustainable hydrogen production. However, its practical application still faces critical challenges including membrane dependency, complex seawater pretreatment, and limited compatibility with intermittent renewable energy. Herein, we construct a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system employing TQBQ&#8208;COF (Covalent Organic Framework) as a solid&#8208;state redox mediator, enabling membrane&#8208; and desalination&#8208;free operation. TQBQ&#8208;COF exhibits excellent electrochemical performances in both acidic deionized water and acidic seawater, demonstrating that common seawater ions do not interfere with its redox activity. When coupled with a Ru&#8208;modified TQBQ&#8208;COF catalyst (COF&#8208;Ru), the DSDE system decouples anode and cathode reactions, allowing flexible integration with intermittent renewable energy for high&#8208;purity H2 and Cl2 production. This system achieves a hydrogen production cost of US$2.5 per kg H2, offering a simplified, robust, and scalable solution for practical seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Asymmetric Wettability for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework membranes with asymmetric wettability enable efficient photocatalytic H2O2. production through synergistic enhancement of triphase mass transfer and photocatalytic activity, and can be further integrated into diverse membrane reactors for organic pollutant degradation using in situ generated H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis from air and water is a sustainable route but hindered by mass transport and charge separation issues. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with asymmetric wettability are developed to construct triphase interfaces, locally enriching O2 and H2O for efficient reactions. Converting COF powders into nanostructured membranes enhances light absorption and band alignment, promoting water oxidation and charge separation. These synergistic effects boost H2O2 production to 52.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under O2, with an apparent quantum yield 27.8 times higher than powders, and up to 148.9&#8208;fold under air. The flexible membranes can be integrated into reactors, and the in situ generated H2O2 enables pollutant degradation. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy for high&#8208;performance triphase photocatalysis and multifunctional membrane catalysts toward sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Decoding Molecular Conformations of Dimeric Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for High&#8208;Sensitivity Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first single&#8208;crystal structures of dimeric NFAs. They feature compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and stronger coupling than monomers. H2&#8208;C8&#8208;based self&#8208;powered near&#8208;infrared photodetectors reach 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;101&#8308; Jones at 880&#160;nm, among the best reported.








Abstract
The molecular conformation and packing behavior of dimeric non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) remain largely unexplored, limiting their rational design for optoelectronic applications. Here, we report the first single&#8208;crystal structures of two imidazole&#8208;based dimeric NFAs, revealing well&#8208;defined intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and compact molecular packing in the monomolecular state. These structural features lead to shorter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distances and enhanced electronic coupling compared to their monomeric counterpart, resulting in improved charge carrier mobility and photoresponse. By varying the length of the alkyl linker, we tailor the optoelectronic properties and suppress the dark current in organic photodetectors (OPDs), enhancing both external quantum efficiency and specific detectivity. Devices based on the C8&#8208;linked dimer (H2&#8208;C8) achieve a peak detectivity (Dsh*) of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 Jones at 880&#160;nm, and maintain values above 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones across 340&#8211;960&#160;nm with an ultra&#8208;fast photoresponse time of 1.94 (trise) and 2.11 (tfall) &#181;s. These figures of merit place H2&#8208;C8 among the best&#8208;performing self&#8208;powered near&#8208;infrared OPDs, with performance on par with commercial silicon photodiodes. Our findings provide direct structural insights into dimeric NFAs and establish a new design pathway for high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Selective Reductive Amination of Carbonyls to Primary Amines Under Ambient Conditions Over Rh/MFM&#8208;300(Cr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) enables highly selective reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived and other carbonyls with NH3 and H2 to affordprimary amines with up to 99% selectivity under ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;atm).








Abstract
The synthesis of organic amines via reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived carbonyl compounds is an important target for sustainable chemical industries. The control of selectivity for the formation of primary amines versus secondary amines is challenging, and high temperature and pressures using H2 are required to generate the desired selectivity. Herein, we report the highly selective reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones by NH3 and H2 over Rh/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) to form primary amines with a selectivity of up to 99% under ambient conditions. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals that the Rh species not only promote the hydrogenation process, but also catalyzes the ammonolysis of the Schiff base intermediate, facilitating the selective synthesis of primary amines. This protocol achieves selective reductive amination at 25&#160;&#176;C and 1&#160;atm, providing an energy&#8208;efficient route to a broad spectrum of amines.

         <title>Boolean Logic&#8208;Based Controlled Release of Bioactive Proteins with Diversified Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We recombinantly express autonomously compiling Boolean logical operators enabling controlled release of therapeutically relevant proteins in response to precise user&#8208;defined combinations of environmental inputs. Here, we demonstrate that growth factors, enzymes, nanobodies, de novo&#8208;designed cytokines, and fluorescent proteins can be proteolytically and/or photochemically released while retaining native bioactivity. 








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials hold great promise in controlled therapeutic delivery, tissue engineering, and biosensing applications. Recently, molecular assembly via autonomous compilation has been employed to create topologically specified protein cargos that can be site&#8208;specifically tethered to and conditionally released from biomaterials following user&#8208;programmable Boolean logic. Prior implementation has been confined to simple fluorescent protein outputs and model protease inputs. In this manuscript, we extend the applicability of this framework by assembling all 7 unique logical operations emanating from a YES/OR/AND 3&#8208;input operator set to deliver bioactive proteins spanning diverse categories: growth factors (epidermal growth factor), model enzymes (&#946;&#8208;lactamase, NanoLuciferase, and thioredoxin A), therapeutic nanobodies (anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), de novo&#8208;engineered cytokines (Neoleukin), and fluorescent proteins (mGreenLantern). In so doing, we demonstrate programmable biomacromolecule release from material anchors in response to precise combinations of three orthogonal protease actuators while maintaining native bioactivity. Through inclusion of a photocleavable protein motif, we further establish that visible light can be employed as an additional input in specifying logic&#8208;based protein release. We anticipate these methods will powerfully expand opportunities for targeted therapeutic delivery and beyond.

     alt="Boolean Logic-Based Controlled Release of Bioactive Proteins with Diversified Inputs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recombinantly express autonomously compiling Boolean logical operators enabling controlled release of therapeutically relevant proteins in response to precise user-defined combinations of environmental inputs. Here, we demonstrate that growth factors, enzymes, nanobodies, de novo-designed cytokines, and fluorescent proteins can be proteolytically and/or photochemically released while retaining native bioactivity. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive biomaterials hold great promise in controlled therapeutic delivery, tissue engineering, and biosensing applications. Recently, molecular assembly via autonomous compilation has been employed to create topologically specified protein cargos that can be site-specifically tethered to and conditionally released from biomaterials following user-programmable Boolean logic. Prior implementation has been confined to simple fluorescent protein outputs and model protease inputs. In this manuscript, we extend the applicability of this framework by assembling all 7 unique logical operations emanating from a YES/OR/AND 3-input operator set to deliver bioactive proteins spanning diverse categories: growth factors (epidermal growth factor), model enzymes (&#946;-lactamase, NanoLuciferase, and thioredoxin A), therapeutic nanobodies (anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), de novo-engineered cytokines (Neoleukin), and fluorescent proteins (mGreenLantern). In so doing, we demonstrate programmable biomacromolecule release from material anchors in response to precise combinations of three orthogonal protease actuators while maintaining native bioactivity. Through inclusion of a photocleavable protein motif, we further establish that visible light can be employed as an additional input in specifying logic-based protein release. We anticipate these methods will powerfully expand opportunities for targeted therapeutic delivery and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualization of Electrical Trees: Oxygen Metabolism Insights and Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescence imaging of Lichtenberg figures (PI&#8208;LF), guided by a newly established dual&#8208;pathway oxygen metabolism mechanism in photoactivated phosphorescent materials, involves both energy&#8208; (1O2) and charge&#8208;transfer (O2&#8226;&#8722;) routes with molecule&#8208;dependent selectivity. These insights enable oxygen sensing and high&#8208;resolution visualization of dielectric degradation, uncovering the hierarchical progression of electrical tree growth.








Abstract
Electrical treeing, manifesting as Lichtenberg figures (LFs) is a major cause of dielectric failure in power, communication, and aerospace systems. Visualization of LF evolution has been hindered by passive imaging limits. Here, we introduce phosphorescence imaging of Lichtenberg figures (PI&#8208;LF), which maps both structural damage and localized oxygen depletion via high&#8208;contrast luminescent signals. Guided by a mechanistic understanding of oxygen metabolism in photoactivated phosphorescent systems, indole&#8208;core dopants with tunable chromaticity reveal dual oxygen pathways: energy transfer to singlet oxygen and electron transfer to superoxide radicals. Polymer systems doped with these luminophores resolve fine structural progression of electrical trees, enabling bioimaging&#8208;style analysis that uncovers a previously hidden spherical&#8208;layered growth mode. PI&#8208;LF bridges molecular photophysics and high&#8208;voltage engineering, establishing a paradigm for luminescence&#8208;based visualization of dielectric breakdown.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Quinoid Backbone Synergistic with Side&#8208;Chain Engineering Enables Ultrahigh&#8208;Temperature Conjugated Polymers for Bridging Solar&#8208; and Laser&#8208;Driven Photothermal Applications</title>

An innovative dual&#8208;quinoid backbone strategy, distinct from donor&#8211;acceptor or mono&#8208;quinoid designs, integrates quinoidal and proquinoidal units with side&#8208;chain engineering to deliver excellent photothermal performance under both solar and laser excitation. PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 reaches 356&#160;&#176;C and drives 2.78&#160;kg m&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 solar evaporation rate, setting records for organic materials and bridging solar and laser&#8208;driven applications.








Abstract
Organic photothermal materials often perform efficiently under either solar or laser irradiation, yet achieving dual high performance within one system remains a formidable challenge due to stringent molecular design requirements. Here, we present a dual&#8208;quinoid backbone strategy&#8212;incorporating quinoidal and proquinoidal units&#8212;synergistically combined with side&#8208;chain engineering in conjugated polymers. Two dual&#8208;quinoid polymers with linear or bulky alkyl side chains are synthesized and benchmarked against the mono&#8208;quinoid analogue PAQM&#8208;3T. Incorporation of proquinoidal unit enhances quinoidal resonance, diradical character, and reorganization energy, yielding broadened near&#8208;infrared absorption with a laser&#8208;resonant peak near 808&#160;nm, suppressed radiative loss, and superior photothermal conversion. Side&#8208;chain engineering further regulates backbone planarity and intramolecular rotation, with the bulky&#8208;chain derivative PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 exhibiting greater rotational freedom and weaker interchain interactions. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (1.2&#160;W cm&#8210;2), PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 achieves an ultrahigh temperature of 356.0&#160;&#176;C, one of the highest values reported among all photothermal material classes, and maintains excellent photostability. Beyond laser&#8208;driven high&#8208;temperature applications, PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 enables solar&#8208;driven water evaporation rate of 2.78&#160;kg m&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 under 1 sun, setting a new record for Janus interfacial evaporators employing pure organic photothermal absorbers. This synergistic molecular design enables multifunctional organic photothermal materials bridging solar energy harvesting with laser&#8208;driven thermal applications.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Generated Electric Fields and Ligand Non&#8208;Innocence Drive the Record&#8208;High Efficiency of Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin Catalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>

A unified design strategy for Fe&#8211;porphyrin electrocatalysts is developed by identifying local electric fields and ligand redox non&#8208;innocence as the principal drivers of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. This work uncovers how strategic charge placement tunes catalytic performance, offering a predictive framework for next&#8208;generation catalyst design.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is a critical step in sustainable catalysis, with iron&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe&#8211;TPP) derivatives recognised as benchmark catalysts, reaching turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 106 s&#8722;1 with trimethylammonium (TMA) substitution. However, substituent effects remain unpredictable: sulfonyl groups render the catalyst inactive, while others enhance activity, yielding over 50 analogues without coherent design principle. Using density functional theory (DFT) and response theory (including electric field effects), we identify factors governing this variability. Electronic structure analysis reveals the redox non&#8208;innocent behaviour of TPP ligand, forming [Fe(II)TPP&#8226;&#8226;]2&#8722; species, stabilised by antiferromagnetic coupling (J = &#8722;656 cm&#8722;1). The ligand's ability to transiently hold and transfer electrons during the catalytic cycle enhances catalytic performance. Energetic&#8208;span model analysis for Fe&#8211;TPP&#160;(1), Fe&#8211;p&#8208;TMA (2), and Fe&#8211;o&#8208;TMA (3) yields barriers of 195.5, 184.4, and 162.2&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, matching experiments 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1. Crucially, local electric fields (LEFs), arising from charged substituents dominate reactivity, surpassing traditional steric or inductive considerations. Applying an oriented electric field of&#160;+&#160;0.21&#160;V &#197;&#8722;1 to 1 reproduces the performance of 3, confirming LEF as a unifying descriptor. Guided by this, we in silico design next&#8208;generation catalysts, setting a new paradigm in CO2 reduction catalysis.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Flipping of a Nonproductive Substrate Binding Conformation Facilitates Hydroxynitrile Lyase Catalyzed Hydrocyanation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 52/2025)</title>

         <dc:description>
Conformational interchange of enzyme&#8211;substrate complexes are intrinsic to catalysis, yet their transient nature makes it elusive for understanding the substrate conformational dynamics. In the Research Article (e15778) by Yi&#8208;Lei Zhao, Hui&#8208;Lei Yu, and co&#8208;workers a &#8220;flipped&#8221; substrate binding conformation in the hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) is revealed. Crystallographic and computational analyses show that this non&#8208;productive state must reorganize before catalysis proceeds. Mutagenesis destabilizes this non&#8208;productive conformation, promoting conversion to the productively competent state and markedly enhancing enzymatic efficiency.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol: A Roadmap toward Practical Implementation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review integrates techno&#8208;economic analyses, mechanistic insights, theoretical calculations, and catalyst design strategies for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MeOH) conversion. Emphasis is placed on key intermediates, pathway divergence, and the role of surface chemistry and operating conditions. Together, these perspectives establish principles for selective, scalable, and economically viable MeOH production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol (MeOH) unites two urgent global needs, carbon recycling and renewable energy storage, into a single, compelling chemical transformation. According to recent techno&#8208;economic analyses, commercially competitive MeOH production (at &#8776;$190 per ton) can be achieved via electroreduction by meeting practical targets for current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and stability. Moreover, MeOH's high energy density (16&#160;MJ&#160;L&#8722;1), substantial hydrogen content (100&#160;g H2 per L), and low storage and transport costs further underscore its strong economic potential. Yet, the complexity of the six&#8208;electron&#8211;proton transfer (ET&#8211;PT) process that governs its formation remains intrinsically complex, with competing pathways threatening selectivity at every stage. This review critically examines current mechanistic insights, highlighting key intermediates such as CO and OCH3, and demonstrating how catalyst surfaces and reaction conditions profoundly influence pathway divergence. We highlight recent advances in catalyst development that exploit a fundamental, molecular&#8208;level understanding of intermediate stabilization to deliver unprecedented MeOH selectivity and activity. Through detailed analysis of operational parameters&#8212;including mass transport dynamics, electrolyte composition, and applied potentials&#8212;this work provides a comprehensive framework for rational catalyst development. Together, these insights converge design principles for next&#8208;generation electrocatalysts capable of selectively converting CO2&#8208;to&#8208;MeOH at scale, advancing economically viable and environmentally sustainable MeOH production.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Assemblies via Metal&#8211;Metal Interactions for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>

Square&#8208;planar d8 metal complexes tend to aggregate, forming long&#8208;range ordered nanostructures in aqueous solutions. These structures exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption or excitation bands in the red or NIR regions, making them highly valuable for bioimaging and phototherapy. This review summarizes recent advancements in the design, performance, and optimization of supramolecular assemblies using metal&#8211;metal interactions for biomedical applications. It also addresses current challenges and proposes potential future directions to expedite the clinical translation of these findings. 








Abstract
Over the past decades, self&#8208;assembly has become a pivotal strategy for the construction of tunable supramolecular nanoarchitectures. In particular, supramolecular assemblies from d8 transition metal complexes have garnered widespread attention as bioimaging and therapeutic agents owing to their rich physicochemical properties resulting from metallophilic interactions. These supramolecular assemblies exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, which are critical for imaging and phototherapy because low&#8208;energy light can penetrate deeper into tissue and poses less cytotoxic risk compared to ultraviolet light. In cell cultures, these self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates enhance cellular uptake via endocytic pathways. In certain cases, they induce irreversible organelle swelling and membrane permeabilization, leading to organelle dysfunction and cell death, thereby overcoming chemotherapy resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, metallophilic interactions remain stable during in vivo blood circulation, facilitating the formation of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with strong tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities. Therefore, supramolecular assemblies offer an innovative and straightforward method for enhancing tumor treatment efficacy. This review highlights recent advances in the development of supramolecular assemblies via metal&#8211;metal interactions for use in bioimaging and therapy; summarizes the design strategies, self&#8208;assembly processes, photochemical and photophysical properties, bioimaging performance, and therapeutic efficacy of representative supramolecular assemblies; and discusses challenges and opportunities for these assemblies in biological applications.

         <title>Reply to Correspondence on &#8220;Suppressing Energy Migration via Antiparallel Spin Alignment in One&#8208;Dimensional Mn2+ Halide Magnets with High Luminescence Efficiency&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>

To address concerns regarding the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) or radiative rate kr of Cd2+ doped (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC:0.2Cd2+), we conducted additional experiments on Cu impurity content, PLQY, and magneto&#8208;optical spectra of both TMMC and TMMC:0.2Cd2+. Our results show that TMMC consistently exhibits a higher PLQY than TMMC:0.2Cd2+, even though TMMC contains trace Cu impurities, confirming that the antiparallel spin ordering of Mn2+ ions plays a role similar to Cd2+ in suppressing excitonic energy migration toward Cu2+ trapping centers.








Abstract
To address concerns regarding the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) or radiative rate (kr) of Cd2+ doped (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC:0.2Cd2+), we conducted additional experiments on Cu impurity content, PLQY, and magneto&#8208;optical spectra of both TMMC and TMMC:0.2Cd2+. Our results show that TMMC consistently exhibits a higher PLQY than TMMC:0.2Cd2+, even though TMMC contains trace Cu impurities, which typically act as luminescence&#8208;quenching centers. The PLQY and kr values for TMMC:0.2Cd2+ in our previous study may have been underestimated due to the susceptibility of halide samples and PLQY measurements to experimental conditions and the absence of a standardized measurement method. However, the predicted radiative rate (kr&#160;=&#160;1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;103 s&#8722;1) for TMMC:0.2Cd2+, as derived from the pressure&#8208;dependent model in the Correspondence, leads to an unphysical negative nonradiative rate (knr) when considering the experimentally observed decay lifetime of 0.935&#160;ms. This inconsistency renders the predicted data unconvincing, despite the theoretical validity of the model. Furthermore, the field&#8208;dependent PL intensities and decay lifetimes of TMMC and TMMC:0.2Cd2+ confirm that the antiparallel spin ordering of Mn2+ ions plays a role similar to Cd2+ in suppressing excitonic energy migration toward Cu2+ trapping centers.

&lt;/i&gt;) of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; doped (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NMnCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (TMMC:0.2Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), we conducted additional experiments on Cu impurity content, PLQY, and magneto-optical spectra of both TMMC and TMMC:0.2Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Our results show that TMMC consistently exhibits a higher PLQY than TMMC:0.2Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, even though TMMC contains trace Cu impurities, which typically act as luminescence-quenching centers. The PLQY and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; values for TMMC:0.2Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in our previous study may have been underestimated due to the susceptibility of halide samples and PLQY measurements to experimental conditions and the absence of a standardized measurement method. However, the predicted radiative rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for TMMC:0.2Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, as derived from the pressure-dependent model in the Correspondence, leads to an unphysical negative nonradiative rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) when considering the experimentally observed decay lifetime of 0.935&#160;ms. This inconsistency renders the predicted data unconvincing, despite the theoretical validity of the model. Furthermore, the field-dependent PL intensities and decay lifetimes of TMMC and TMMC:0.2Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; confirm that the antiparallel spin ordering of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions plays a role similar to Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in suppressing excitonic energy migration toward Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; trapping centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Crossiguanipyrazines with Potent Activity Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation of crossiguanipyrazines (CGPs) from Crossiella cryophila DSM 44230 revealed potent activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with no detected cytotoxicity. Stable isotope&#8208;labeling studies uncovered their distinctive biosynthetic origin, and the first total synthesis of CGP I was accomplished, enabling future optimization.








Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases, with rising antimicrobial resistance exacerbating the urgent need for new therapeutic agents. Here, we report the discovery of crossiguanipyrazines A&#8208;I, a rare family of potent anti&#8208;TB alkylpyrazines from the underexplored actinobacterium Crossiella cryophila DSM 44230. Crossiguanipyrazines (CGPs) feature an unusual 3&#8208;methoxyl&#8208;2,5,6&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;pyrazine scaffold with variable hydroxylation and N&#8208;prenylation. The stereochemistry of CGPs A&#8208;G was determined by Mosher's analysis and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Stable isotope&#8208;labeling revealed a unique biosynthetic origin from arginine and acetate. Inhibition with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor suppressed hydroxylation, while feeding experiments with stable isotope&#8208;labeled CGP I demonstrated its role as a precursor for other CGPs, implicating P450 enzymes in CGP diversification. CGPs C and H exhibited potent anti&#8208;TB activity in the low micromolar range without mammalian cell cytotoxicity, unlike previously reported cytotoxic trialkylpyrazine&#8208;type natural products. Structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies highlighted the critical roles of hydroxylation and N&#8208;prenylation in modulating biological activity. Furthermore, we achieved the first total synthesis of CGP I, which validated the chemical structure and provided a foundation for further optimization of this compound class. These findings suggest that CGPs can serve as useful starting points for anti&#8208;TB drug development.

         <title>Resonant Dative Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dative bonds are an integral, albeit underappreciated, part of the theory of chemical bonds. In their resonant form they can bring a surprising stability to a novel family of rings with multiple hyper/hypo&#8208;valent elements.








Abstract
The dative bond is an often underappreciated entity in the theory of chemical interactions, despite its explanatory and predictive potential. In this work, the concept is recovered to computationally design a novel resonant dative bonding pattern in ring molecules, which would be formally considered to be composed of multiple hypervalent and hypovalent atoms. Starting with the (HCPO)3 ring arranged as alternating carbons and phosphorus, we propose that the major Lewis structure is composed of P&#9552;O double bonds and &#8220;semi&#8208;dative&#8208;semi&#8208;covalent&#8221; P&#9472;C bonds. The three carbons technically are a rare case of &#963;0&#960;2 carbenes; however, due to the stability granted by the delocalized, resonant dative bonds, we termed them &#8220;pseudo&#8208;carbenes&#8221;. By experimenting with isoelectronic systems with other elements but with the same bonding pattern, we also observed pseudo&#8208;nitrenes, pseudo&#8208;silylenes, and dicoordinated halogens, among other unusual structures. Surprisingly, the isomeric rings with normal valence and traditional covalent bonds were found to be of much higher energy, suggesting that the resonant dative bonds can potentially be a source of highly stable molecular entities.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective RNA Modification by Programmable DNA&#8208;Small Molecule Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable DNA&#8211;DMAP conjugates enable site&#8208;selective acylation of native RNAs via proximity&#8208;driven catalysis. This strategy allows programmable RNA modification at targeted 2&#8242;&#8208;OH positions using pentafluorophenyl esters as acylating reagents, with broad applicability to diverse RNA types. Azide&#8208;functionalized acyl groups allow functionalization with strain&#8208;release click reaction, offering a robust platform for RNA modification.








Abstract
Efficient strategies for site&#8208;selective modification of native RNA are highly important for advancing fundamental research of RNA biology and translational RNA therapeutics. Previous approaches generally rely on the catalytic properties of enzymes or nucleic acids, such as repurposed transferases or in vitro selected ribozymes. However, these methods suffer from sequence bias and complicated production processes and often require proper folding of the biomolecules, limiting their programmability, rational design, and robustness. Here, we present a site&#8208;selective RNA acylation strategy with a DNA&#8211;DMAP (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) conjugate, considerably smaller in size than enzymes or ribozymes. This conjugate hybridizes to the target RNA region and catalyzes an acyl transfer reaction from pentafluorophenyl (PFP) esters to a proximal 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group. By programming the DNA&#8208;DMAP sequence, the predetermined sites and often their adjacent sites in RNA can be selectively acylated with high conversion and fast reaction rates, making this strategy applicable to RNAs of varying lengths, including short synthetic RNAs, native 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and eGFP mRNA. The azide&#8208;bearing acyl donors enable further chemical functionalization at the acylated sites via click reaction, establishing this approach as a versatile and general platform for in vitro site&#8208;selective RNA labeling and functionalization.

         <title>Strong, Yet Split Hydrogen Bonding with Ice Rules in Delafossite (H/D)RhO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong, yet split! The delafossites HRhO2 and DRhO2 feature linear O&#8211;(H/D)&#8211;O moieties with split hydrogen bonds arranged on a triangular sublattice. Structure, spectroscopy, and electronic structure calculations help resolve conflicting reports of the nature of hydrogen bonding in delafossites and related compounds. In analogy with Ising spins on a triangular lattice, there is no evidence of ordering of the short and long O&#8211;(H/D) distances.








Abstract
Despite remaining enigmatic, strong hydrogen bonding provides an advanced design handle for tailoring the properties of functional materials. Here, 3R&#8211;(H/D)RhO2 delafossites (prepared by ion exchange of Na+ from NaRhO2) contain H/D in linear coordination with O, linking RhIIIO2 layers. Bragg and real&#8208;space X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering analysis, vibrational and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT)&#8211;based electronic structure calculations have been employed to understand the nature of the hydrogen bonding. Despite short distances between H/D and the two O to which they are bonded, a clear double&#8208;minimum corresponding to a shorter and longer (H/D)&#8211;O distance is established. The triangular lattices formed by H/D appear to display ice&#8208;like disorder, corroborated by low&#8208;temperature heat capacity measurements.

Here, 3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;(H/D)RhO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delafossites (prepared by ion exchange of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from NaRhO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) contain H/D in linear coordination with O, linking Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. Bragg and real-space X-ray and neutron scattering analysis, vibrational and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT)&#8211;based electronic structure calculations have been employed to understand the nature of the hydrogen bonding. Despite short distances between H/D and the two O to which they are bonded, a clear double-minimum corresponding to a shorter and longer (H/D)&#8211;O distance is established. The triangular lattices formed by H/D appear to display ice-like disorder, corroborated by low-temperature heat capacity measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatial Assembly of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes on Rationally Designed Cavitands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial molecular assembly strategy enables the synthesis of enantioenriched mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Inherently chiral cavitands are rationally designed to encode and transmit the stereochemical information. Predictable stereochemical induction is achieved by controlling the spatial arrangement of molecular components through engineering combinations of covalent bonding, noncovalent interactions, and reaction activation.








Abstract
Chirality plays a central role in chemistry, biology, and pharmaceutical sciences. Although covalent chirality is widely studied, stereoselective assembly of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) remains challenging. Herein, we report a spatial assembly strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes. Rationally designed inherently chiral cavitands orchestrate the spatial arrangement of macrocycle and axle components during mechanical interlocking. This approach enables high levels of stereocontrol in both active&#8208;template and passive&#8208;template synthesis of MPC rotaxanes (up to 93:7 e.r.). Our study demonstrates that stereoinduction of MIMs can be made predictable through rational design of chiral auxiliaries, paving the way for applications of the spatial assembly strategy in asymmetric supramolecular synthesis.

         <title>De Novo Design of High&#8208;Affinity Miniprotein Binders Targeting Francisella Tularensis Virulence Factor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid physics and deep&#8208;learning enabled design methods identified miniprotein binders to Flpp3 (Francisella&#8208;like lipoprotein), a key virulence factor from Francisella tularensis. Multiple candidates with nanomolar to picomolar binding affinities were obtained using yeast surface display screening and further experimental optimization. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of Flpp3&#8208;miniprotein complex (PDB ID: 9NLT) closely matches the design model, validating the design approach.








Abstract
Francisella tularensis poses considerable public health risk due to its high infectivity and potential for bioterrorism. Francisella&#8208;like lipoprotein (Flpp3), a key virulence factor unique to Francisella, plays critical roles in infection and immune evasion, making it a promising target for therapeutic development. However, the lack of well&#8208;defined binding pockets and structural information on native interactions has hindered structure&#8208;guided ligand discovery against Flpp3. Here, we used a combination of physics&#8208;based and deep&#8208;learning methods to design high&#8208;affinity miniprotein binders targeting two distinct sites on Flpp3. We identified four binders for site I with binding affinities ranging between 24&#8211;110&#160;nM. For the second site, an initial binder showed a dissociation constant (KD) of 81&#160;nM, and subsequent site saturation mutagenesis yielded variants with sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities. Circular dichroism confirmed the topology of designed miniproteins. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of Flpp3 in complex with a site I binder is nearly identical to the design model (C&#945; root&#8208;mean&#8208;square deviation (RMSD): 0.9&#160;&#197;). These designed miniproteins provide research tools to explore the roles of Flpp3 in tularemia and should enable the development of new therapeutic candidates.

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Bond&#8208;Toughened Epoxy Resins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked epoxy network with high toughness and high elongation was developed through the strategic incorporation of [2]rotaxane&#8208;based mechanical bond whose unique intramolecular motion enables efficient energy dissipation under external force. This work offers a new strategy for toughening epoxy resins and advancing mechanically interlocked materials.








Abstract
Epoxy resins, while indispensable for their excellent mechanical strength, face fundamental limitations due to their inherent brittleness. Here we present a novel advancement in epoxy toughening through the strategic incorporation of [2]rotaxane&#8208;based mechanical bond as mechanically interlocked cross&#8208;linker, whose unique intramolecular motion enables efficient energy dissipation and stress redistribution under external force. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared mechanically interlocked epoxy networks (MINEP) exhibit elongation of 272% and toughness of 37.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, both representing an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement over the conventional counterpart while showcasing notable properties compared to other epoxy materials. Further, we capitalize on the adhesive effect and good toughness of MINEP to toughen graphene films. Compared to pristine graphene films, the MINEP&#8208;bonded films show significantly enhanced toughness (30.2&#160;versus 3.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), elongation (26.5%&#160;versus 9.9%), and maximum strength (237&#160;versus 72.3&#160;MPa). This work not only provides an effective strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance epoxy resins, but also exploits their application potential in toughening two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials.

         <title>Harnessing Deaminated DNA to Modulate mRNA Translation for Controlled and Sequential Protein Expression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damaged DNA regulates the kinetics of mRNA translation in cells, which is a critical parameter for the safe and effective use of mRNA therapeutics. Simple annealing of damaged DNA to mRNA enables up to a 20&#8208;fold reduction in expression rate with a &#8764;200&#8208;min delay. This strategy requires no chemical modification of the mRNA and generates only nontoxic/recyclable DNA fragments, making it broadly applicable to therapeutic settings.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) offers transformative potential in vaccines and therapeutics for a range of intractable diseases. While considerable efforts have focused on enhancing protein expression levels to improve efficacy, comparatively little attention has been given to regulating the rate and timing of protein expression. Given that sudden antigen bursts can overstimulate immune responses and pose serious risks in susceptible individuals, precise control over translation kinetics is essential for safe and personalized mRNA therapies. Herein, we describe the use of &#8220;damaged&#8221; DNA to modulate translation rates of mRNAs. Hybridization of deoxyuridine&#8208;containing DNA to the 5&#8242;&#8208;end of mRNA inhibits translation initiation, which is subsequently displaced via base excision repair (BER), enabling controlled expression. DNA strand lengths determine the rate and onset of translation (e.g., a 52&#8208;nt DNA induces a 20&#8208;fold slower expression with a 200&#8208;min delay). This also enables the sequential expression of multiple mRNAs from a single cocktail. This strategy requires no chemical modification of the mRNA and produces no toxic byproducts, but only recyclable DNA fragments&#8212;offering a broadly applicable and biocompatible adjuvant for controlled mRNA translation.

A &#8220;topological&#8208;duality&#8208;driven&#8221; strategy is adopted to construct high&#8208;nuclearity Cu24Ag54 which presents impressive reactivity and durability for CO2 electroreduction with selectivity of 98% and current density up to 750 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Precise control of active sites with atomic resolution in metal nanoclusters (MNCs) presents a promising avenue for catalyst engineering towards CO2 electroreduction. However, effective strategies to construct high&#8208;nuclearity MNCs while balancing catalytic stability and active&#8208;site exposure remain scarce. Herein, we propose a &#8220;topological&#8208;duality&#8208;driven&#8221; strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclearity Cu24Ag54 nanocluster, featuring an octahedral {Cu24} shell and a double&#8208;truncated cubic {Ag54} core with exposed {Ag3} vertices on {111} facets. Notably, the double&#8208;truncated cubic is a previously unexplored concave polyhedron with over twice the number of {111} facets compared to conventional structures. As a catalyst for CO2 electroreduction, Cu24Ag54 delivers exceptional performance including a Faradaic efficiency for CO of &#8764;98%, catalytic stability exceeding 100 h, and current densities up to 750 mA cm&#8722;2 (total current 3 A), ranking among the highest values of the reported MNCs. Dedicated studies show the nested structure and increased electron delocalization underpin the catalyst durability. The facilitated electron transfer from Ag to the key intermediate *COOH and electron delocalization effect significantly reduce the energy barrier for *COOH formation by 50%. This work provides a new perspective on the potential of topological geometries in designing high&#8208;nuclearity MNCs for highly efficient and robust CO2 electroreduction at industrial current density.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of Bacterial Terpene Synthases from Chitinophagaceae Producing Marine&#8208;Type Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six bacterial terpene synthases are reported, one of which produces instable chitinosphaerol, which is spontaneously transformed into several known natural products requiring structural revision. A second enzyme yields thermally labile neodolabella&#8208;1(14),2,7&#8208;triene, which upon heating shows sequential conversion into thermocyclenes A&#8211;C. The mechanisms of the enzymatic and thermal reactions were investigated experimentally and computationally.








Abstract
Two neodolabellane&#8208;type diterpene synthases from Chitinophaga japonensis (CjCsS and CjNdtS) in addition to one enzyme from Dinghuibacter silviterrae (DsJS) were investigated. CjCsS produces the instable diterpene alcohol chitinosphaerol, which degrades upon chromatographic purification on silica gel to known presphaerol and isosphaerodienes I and II. Despite seemingly solid evidence in the literature, for all three compounds a structural revision is presented. Treatment of chitinosphaerol with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide resulted in the formation of the stable compounds bromosphaerols A and B. Phylogenetically unrelated CjNdtS catalyses the formation of neodolabella&#8208;1(14),2,7&#8208;triene, a compound that undergoes a remarkable thermal three&#8208;step sequence by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to thermocyclene A, followed by a water&#8208;mediated rearrangement to thermocyclene B and double&#8208;bond isomerisation to thermocyclene C. Japonene A was identified as a side product, but is the main product of DsJS, where it is accompanied by japonene B and anaerol B. The good production of anaerol B by DsJS allowed reinvestigation of its recently addressed biosynthesis as a trace product of peyssonnosol B synthase AbPS2. All structure elucidations in this study were secured through stereoselective deuteration experiments, and special isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the cyclisation mechanisms of the investigated enzymes.

         <title>Thermally Activated Stereoinversion in Benzotrithiophene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers with Water as the Effector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral benzotrithiophene derivative 1 self&#8208;assembles into helical supramolecular polymers whose helicity changes with water content. High water content induces a reversible double stereomutation, while low water content yields a single, stable one. Computational studies show two monomer conformations leading to opposite helices. Water facilitates transitions via triple hydrogen bonding, revealing its key role in modulating chiral polymer structure. 








Abstract
We report the synthesis of the chiral benzotrithiophene (BTT) derivative 1, which self&#8208;assembles into helical supramolecular polymers. The C3 symmetry of BTT 1 enables a unique temperature&#8208;dependent stereomutation process in which water acts as a key effector. Circular dichroism measurements reveal that a higher water content induces a double stereomutation, ultimately restoring the original helicity. In contrast, reducing the water content leads to a single, stable stereomutation, which duration depends on the amount of water in solution. To elucidate the stereomutation mechanism, we conducted a multi&#8208;level computational study, identifying two main conformations for the monomeric species that lead to diastereomeric helices with different preferred handedness, thus resulting in opposite dichroic patterns. The transition between these aggregates involves rotation of the BTT cores and amide groups, a process significantly facilitated by water molecules via triple hydrogen bonding within the helical stack. These findings exhibit the crucial role of the solvent in modulating chiral supramolecular polymer structures and provide unprecedented insights into the influence of water on self&#8208;assembly and stereomutation processes.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced CO2 Methanation over Au@Ru/TiO2 via Nanoscale Control of Ru Shell Thickness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au@Ru core&#8211;shell nanoparticles on TiO2 integrate active Ru sites with Au plasmonic excitation. At 190&#160;&#176;C, 545&#160;nm light boosts CO2 methanation rates by 335% while preserving &gt;99% CH4 selectivity. The catalyst outperforms Ru/C and remains stable for 85&#160;h, underscoring nanoscale shell engineering for efficient light&#8208;assisted thermocatalysis.








Abstract
Plasmonic&#8208;catalytic nanostructures enable coupling light harvesting with chemical transformations, yet their performance critically depends on nanoscale architecture and metal&#8208;support interactions. Here, we synthesize Au@Ru core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with tunable Ru coverage and immobilize them on TiO2 to create hybrid catalysts for CO2 methanation. By controlling Ru shell thickness, we identifyAu60Ru40/TiO2, featuring a thin, discontinuous shell (&#8764;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystallites), as the most active composition. This catalyst combines abundant Ru active sites with preservation of the Au core's localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Under 545&#160;nm illumination, it shows a 335% rate enhancement over dark conditions at 190&#160;&#176;C, outperforming commercial Ru/C and remaining stable for 85&#160;h. Optical, structural, and&#160;kinetic analysis indicate that illumination accelerates the methanation without changing the rate&#8208;determining step, consistent with a dominant photothermal contribution. Density functional theory reveals that TiO2 induces strong metal&#8208;support interactions, upshifts the Ru d&#8208;band center, strengthens CO2 adsorption, and lowers the barrier for the first hydrogenation step, shifting the rate&#8208;limiting step to CH4 desorption. These results establish Au@Ru/TiO2 as an efficient platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted thermocatalysis and demonstrates that nanoscale shell engineering as a generalizable strategy to optimize&#160;plasmonic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation and beyond.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Self&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, one&#8208;pot nickel&#8208;mediated Friedl&#228;nder annulation strategy was used to construct Ni&#8208;chelated fused&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs. The resulting frameworks combine structural robustness, accessible single&#8208;site Ni centers, and self&#8208;photosensitizing capability, providing a powerful platform for photocatalysis.








Abstract
Conjugated and chemically robust covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating metal ions hold great promise in diverse applications due to their finely tuned optoelectronic properties. However, their synthesis typically relies on post&#8208;synthetic modifications to stabilize linkages and introduce chelation sites, and metal incorporation is almost exclusively achieved through post&#8208;synthetic chelation of pre&#8208;formed COFs. Such approaches often result in compromised crystallinity, incomplete conversion and limited control over modification sites. Here, we report a direct, one&#8208;pot nickel&#8208;mediated Friedl&#228;nder annulation strategy to construct Ni&#8208;chelated fused heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs (NNiN, NNiO, and NNiS). The fused heterocycle linkages act as an additional structural regulation factor, enabling precise tuning of framework packing and metal&#8208;chelation environment, thereby enhancing crystallinity and optoelectronic properties simultaneously. The resulting COFs exhibit extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, efficient Ni chelation and strong charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the visible&#8208;light region. Combining conjugated robust linkages, accessible single&#8208;site Ni centers, and self&#8208;photosensitizing capability, these frameworks provide a powerful platform for photocatalysis. They achieved up to 98% conversion in carbon&#8208;chalcogen coupling reactions, while retaining crystallinity and catalytic activity over multiple cycles. This work thus offers a general strategy for designing stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, and metal&#8208;functionalized COFs, broadening opportunities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.

We doped Mo3+ in Cs2NaInCl6 perovskite lattice in presence of reducing agent, H3PO2. This allows to achieve ambient stable ultra&#8208;narrow near infrared (NIR)&#8208;II photoluminescence featuring intra&#8208;configurational spin flip (ICSF) d&#8594;d$d \to d$ (2T1g/2Eg &#8594;$\to$ 4A2g) transition of Mo3+. A detailed photophysics of multiple ICSF of Mo3+ has been studied. We designed a phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) showing ICFS NIR&#8208;II luminescence for the first time. 








Abstract
Sharp near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) emissions are typically achieved through f&#8594;f$f \to f$ electronic transitions of rare&#8208;earth ions, while d&#8594;d$d \to d$ transitions in transition metal ions are broad due to electron&#8211;ligand interactions. An exception is the intra&#8208;configurational spin&#8208;flip (ICSF) d&#8594;d$d \to d$ transition like t2g3 &#8594;$ \to $ t2g3 of Mo3+ emitting sharp NIR&#8208;II emission, but only at cryogenic temperatures under vacuum. The high oxophilicity of Mo3+ created defects during the synthesis, quenching the emission at room temperature. Herein, we overcome this issue by synthesizing Mo3+&#8722; doped Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskites in a reducing H3PO2 environment. [MoCl6]3&#8722; octahedra are formed, exhibiting ultra&#8208;narrow ICSF d&#8594;d$d \to d$ (2T1g/2Eg &#8594;$ \to $ 4A2g) NIR&#8208;II emission at 1095&#160;nm in ambient conditions. In addition, a second ICSF 2T2g &#8594;$ \to $ 4A2g emission is observed at 700&#160;nm, violating the Kasha's rule. The intensity of ICSF emissions increase with increasing temperature (7&#8211;350&#160;K) due to vibronic coupling relaxing the Laporte selection rule. The samples are stable for more than 6 months in ambient conditions, allowing for a detailed study of fundamental photophysics and fabrications of phosphor&#8208;converted light emitting diodes. This is the first Mo3+&#8211;based NIR&#8208;II optoelectronic device, opening opportunities for applications like optical fibers and lasing.

         <title>Direct Deoxyarylation of Non&#8208;Activated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient direct deoxygenation coupling strategy for the deoxygenation cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl alcohols with various aryl electrophiles has been developed. The substrate alcohols require no preliminary activation, and the reaction occurs in a single step, representing the first direct deoxygenation arylation of non&#8208;activated alkyl alcohols. The reaction is catalyzed under mild conditions, and all reagents utilized are commercially available, inexpensive, and readily accessible. 








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8211;carbon bonds constitutes the most critical fundamental reaction in organic synthesis. Although synthetic chemists have achieved significant advancements in the cross&#8208;coupling of stable C(sp3) substrates, such as aliphatic carboxylic acids and alkyl halides, cost&#8208;effective, accessible, and versatile sources of alkyl groups, specifically alcohols, remain underutilized. The direct deoxygenation of alcohols under mild circumstances presents a significant challenge in organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of an efficient mechanism for the direct activation of C&#9472;O bonds. Consequently, there is an imperative necessity for chemists to devise a multifaceted approach for the cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols. This study aims to utilize neutral diphenylboron radicals as hydroxyl activation agents to directly activate the carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds of prevalent alcohols, thereby generating alkyl radicals, which are subsequently involved in nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylation processes. Both free alcohols and aryl bromides, which are easily accessible compounds, can serve as coupling partners directly without requiring pre&#8208;functionalization. The direct arylation process of alcohols exhibits a broad substrate scope, as demonstrated by the subsequent arylation of several structurally intricate natural compounds and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Modulation by a Versatile Organic Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalysis of NNO for the co&#8208;reatant oxidation enhances the heterogeneous ECL of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ on labeled microbeads or cells. This unique electrocatalytic oxidation of co&#8208;reactant makes NNO a versatile non&#8208;emissive redox mediator for ECL studies. 








Abstract
Adding a redox&#8208;active iridium complex has emerged recently as a new mechanistic pathway to enhance electrochemiluminescence (ECL). But, these redox mediators are costly, require sophisticated synthesis, and induce concomitantly intense ECL emission or a strong background. Herein, we report the use of nortropine N&#8208;oxyl (NNO) radical as a non&#8208;emissive redox mediator for modulating the co&#8208;reactant ECL emission of the archetypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore, thanks to its particular reactivity involving hydride transfer from amines. The reversible oxidation of NNO produced its oxoammonium cation and catalyzed the oxidation of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) and 2&#8208;(dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) co&#8208;reactants. The electrocatalysis of NNO induced a significant decrease in the homogeneous solution&#8208;based ECL. However, it offered the versatility to amplify the heterogeneous ECL by 7.3&#8208;fold for TPrA or even up to 12.5&#8208;fold for DBAE in a bead&#8208;based immunosensing format, and by 5.4&#8208;fold on single cells. The electrocatalytic mechanism of NNO was further deciphered by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The background&#8208;free ECL modulation by NNO depends on either the depletion of amine radical or the generation of another alkoxyl radical at the electrode. Such dramatic ECL amplification opens new perspectives for improving the existing ECL bioassays and microscopy and the design of new biosensing schemes.

         <title>Reactivity of Low Valent Magnesium(I) Complexes with Epoxides and Episulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8211;H functionalisation and ether cleavage are typically performed by aggressive organolithium reagents. Unveiling the untapped Br&#248;nsted basicity of magnesium&#8208;oxo species, the reaction of Mg(I) precursors with epoxides initially proceeds via deoxygenation, followed by deprotonation and rearrangement of a second epoxide. Episulfides form a bridged chalcogen species initially, but ultimately show divergent reactivity to the disulfide&#8208;bridged product.








Abstract
Chemical C&#8211;H functionalisation is traditionally the domain of potent organolithium bases that require cryogenic conditions, whereas biologically inspired C&#8211;H functionalisation can be executed by transition metal&#8208;oxo species. Blending these chemical and biological approaches, this work exploits magnesium&#8208;oxo complexes for selective C&#8211;H deprotonation at ambient temperature. Overall, three low valent magnesium(I) dimers, [DippNacnacMg]2 1, [DepNacnacMg]2 2 and [MesNacnacMg]2 3, react with two equivalents of propylene oxide to generate dinuclear Mg complexes of general formula [NacnacMg(OH)(OCH2CHCH2)MgNacnac] (Nacnac&#160;=&#160;HC(C(CH3)NAr)2). Isolation of oxo&#8208;bridged [DippNacnacMg&#8208;O&#8208;MgDippNacnac] coupled with deuterium labeling studies shows that the reaction proceeds via epoxide deoxygenation, followed by deprotonation and rearrangement of a second equivalent of the epoxide to generate the alkoxide. A range of terminal and internal epoxides was investigated (propylene oxide, butylene oxide, isobutylene oxide, and cyclohexene oxide). The &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;H position was selectively deprotonated in each case, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Exchanging epoxides for episulfides instead generated disulfide&#8208;bridged species, showcasing the difference in Br&#248;nsted basicity between Mg&#8208;O and Mg&#8208;S functional groups. Overall, this work demonstrates the unharnessed potential of main group metal&#8208;oxo complexes for selective C&#8211;H deprotonation.

         <title>Topochemical Alkyne Nitrile Oxide Cycloaddition for Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the toolkit for solid&#8208;state polymer synthesis, we report the first example of a topochemical alkyne nitrile oxide cycloaddition (TANOC), a spontaneous and regiospecific [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition that directly converts a monomer, containing alkyne and nitrile&#8208;oxide at its termini, to an isoxazole&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion at room temperature.








Abstract
Topochemical reactions, characterized by their solvent&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free, and lattice&#8208;controlled nature, offer an attractive method for crystalline polymers. The limited number of reactions amenable to solid&#8208;state execution necessitates a continued pursuit of novel topochemical transformations. Here, we report the first example of a topochemical alkyne nitrile oxide cycloaddition (TANOC) reaction, a spontaneous and regiospecific [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition that directly converts a monomer to an isoxazole&#8208;linked polymer in a SCSC fashion at room temperature. We overcome the inherent reactivity of nitrile oxides through strategic steric protection, enabling the design of a stable monomer amenable to crystallization. Detailed structural analysis of both monomer and polymer by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, coupled with comprehensive spectroscopic and kinetic studies, confirms the formation of an isoxazole&#8208;backbone polymer. Notably, despite an initially unfavorable monomer packing, significant voids within the crystal lattice facilitate a &#8764;118&#176; rotation of the propargyl unit, achieving the precise geometry for spontaneous reaction. This unprecedented thermal topochemical transformation expands the toolkit for solid&#8208;state polymer synthesis, offering a versatile platform for constructing functional materials where the isoxazole linkages can be readily transformed into diverse functionalities.

         <title>About a Trillion Times More Acidic than Expected? On the Difference Between the Hammett H0 and the Unified pH Acidity of Sulfuric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take off the Glasses! Indicator bases are tools for determining the widely used Hammett H0 acidity, which was used to look at pure sulfuric acid. Yet, this is like looking through sunglasses: despite their usefulness, they work as a filter. We take off the glasses and see unfiltered the protochemical pH acidity measured with the H2 electrode: the acidity of pure sulfuric acid is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than the indicator glasses show.








Abstract
We report on the considerable difference between the distinct pH and Hammett's H0 acidity function&#160;in the entire H2O&#8208;H2SO4 mixing range. The Hammett acidity for 100&#160;wt% H2SO4 is accepted with H0 = &#8722;11.9. We measured the pH acidity using two different electrochemical cells, operating with at least one hydrogen electrode, giving for 100% sulfuric acid pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ as&#160;&#8722;24&#160;&#177;&#160;2. This value was confirmed by high&#8208;level compound calculations using the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) level at the basis set limit and COSMO&#8208;RS solvation. Thus, the difference between both scales amounts to pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ &#8722; H0 = &#8722;12 or 12 orders of magnitude. It results from the Gibbs transfer energies of the (protonated) Hammett&#8208;indicator bases B (BH+) used to define and determine H0. High&#8208;level computations of these Gibbs transfer energies confirm our experimental as well as our computational findings. A general method to convert H0 values of acids other than sulfuric acid into pHabsH2O${\mathrm{pH}}_{{\mathrm{abs}}}^{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{O}}}$ values is given. Hence, this huge (pH&#160;&#8722;&#160;H0)&#8208;difference clearly delineates that the often used but erroneous assumption of the H0 values constituting an extension of pH acidity to the realm of negative pH values is wrong. The distinctive protochemical potential curve progression is discussed as a function of sulfuric acid concentration and physical properties, together with the assignment of the potential&#8208;determining species in the respective mixtures. Finally, superacidity is defined in a universal manner, i.e., applicable to all media, i.e., liquid, solid, or gaseous.

         <title>Ultrabright Gold Nanoclusters with Intra&#8208;Cluster Hydrogen Bonding Enable Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Thickness Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Subcellular Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endowing Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technologies with in situ near&#8208;zero&#8208;thickness ECL layer to image single cells and fine subcellular structures at high spatial resolution was achieved by synthesizing ultrabright CR4/ATT&#8208;AuNCs with ECL quantum efficiency (ECLQE) up to 13%, approximately 4.2 times higher than of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, and constraining them in proximity to the electrode.








Abstract
Endowing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technologies with the capability to resolve fine subcellular structures at high spatial resolution remains a challenging yet critical objective. Achieving this requires ultrasmall ECL emitters coupled with in situ confinement strategies to form near&#8208;zero&#8208;thickness ECL layer. Among available candidates, luminescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as promising options, but their ECL emission remains too weak for effective microscopic imaging. To overcome this limitation, we report ultrabright AuNCs protected by Cys&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg peptides and 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymine (CR4/ATT&#8208;AuNCs) as next&#8208;generation ECL emitters. Intra&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding between neighboring ligands rigidifies their conformation and promotes ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, significantly enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8764;60&#8208;fold) and electron transfer efficiency (&#8764;4.8&#8208;fold). This synergistic enhancement activates a previously unreported reduction&#8208;oxidation ECL pathway of AuNCs, resulting in over 250&#8208;fold improvement in ECL intensity. Upon immobilization on electrodes with cells, CR4/ATT&#8208;AuNCs generate a robust, near&#8208;zero&#8208;thickness ECL layer visible to the naked eye, directly enabling high&#8208;resolution ECL microscopy that clearly resolves fine subcellular structures down to &#8764;170&#160;nm. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing ultrasmall high&#8208;performance ECL emitters and demonstrates their potential in advancing the spatial resolution limits of ECL bioimaging.

Among available candidates, luminescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as promising options, but their ECL emission remains too weak for effective microscopic imaging. To overcome this limitation, we report ultrabright AuNCs protected by Cys-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg peptides and 6-aza-2-thiothymine (CR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/ATT-AuNCs) as next-generation ECL emitters. Intra-cluster hydrogen bonding between neighboring ligands rigidifies their conformation and promotes ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, significantly enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8764;60-fold) and electron transfer efficiency (&#8764;4.8-fold). This synergistic enhancement activates a previously unreported reduction-oxidation ECL pathway of AuNCs, resulting in over 250-fold improvement in ECL intensity. Upon immobilization on electrodes with cells, CR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/ATT-AuNCs generate a robust, near-zero-thickness ECL layer visible to the naked eye, directly enabling high-resolution ECL microscopy that clearly resolves fine subcellular structures down to &#8764;170&#160;nm. This work presents a powerful strategy for designing ultrasmall high-performance ECL emitters and demonstrates their potential in advancing the spatial resolution limits of ECL bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergent Chemical Reactivity and Complexity of RNA Condensates</title>

RNA condensates capable of substrate enrichment and catalysis modulate their environment. Could this start a catalytic selection loop or evolution?








Abstract
The RNA world hypothesis posits the existence of life&#8208;like assemblies that consisted mostly of RNA. However, questions remain regarding the emergence of RNA catalysis, stability, reactant availability, and compartmentalization of genetic material. At acidic pH, short RNAs (average &#8776;$\approx$ 20 nt) readily phase&#8208;separate into a condensed phase enriched with long RNA. These RNA condensates stably compartmentalize RNA as well as DNA and maintain stable identities even in the absence of membranes. Additionally, the RNA condensates concentrate ions, small molecules, phospholipids, peptides, ribozymes, and proteins. Beyond enriching such diverse components, RNA condensates function as microreactors with two catalytic capabilities: they physically enhance reaction rates by concentrating reactants within a confined space and simultaneously act as inherent catalysts that directly facilitate chemical transformations. RNA condensates can also support ribozyme and enzymatic activity. Together, these findings suggest that RNA phase separation may have played a crucial role in life's origins by providing compartmentalization, inherent catalytic activity, and molecular enrichment of long, potentially catalytic&#160;biopolymers.

         <title>Fluorescence Visualization of Helix Inversion in Biomimic Polymeric Foldamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, and economical method is provided to directly visualize the solvent&#8208;driven helix inversion in a water&#8208;soluble foldamer using a tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalized hemicyanine dye based on the emission color change from yellow to red. The dyes are first restricted in the low&#8208;polarity groove but then docked on the foldamer surface with the less restricted molecular motions and the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer.








Abstract
Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides possess unique helical structures that are closely related to their biological functions involving recognition, catalysis, replication, and genetic information storage. From a biomimetic perspective, artificial foldamers are the ideal systems to model and study the structure&#8211;property relationship of biomacromolecules. Herein, we report a facile, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective method to directly visualize and monitor the solvent&#8208;driven helix inversion in a water&#8208;soluble poly(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene)&#8208;based foldamer with the aid of a tetraphenylethene&#8208;functionalized hemicyanine dye. By adjusting the solvent environment, the foldamer transitions from an M&#8208;helix to a P&#8208;helix, accompanied by a change in the dye's binding mode from groove to surface. This transition alters the degree of restriction and microenvironment polarity, resulting in a visible emission color change from yellow to red, signaling the helix inversion. The present investigation offers a powerful tool for understanding conformational transitions in biomacromolecules and offers insights into the dynamic behavior of helical structures.

         <title>Heteromultivalent Nanogels as Highly Potent Inhibitors of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteromultivalent polyglycerol nanogel system integrates fucose/galactose and short&#8208;chain antibacterial peptides to achieve strong bactericidal and anti&#8208;biofilm effects at low concentration by efficient multivalent binding with bacterial lectins.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of microbial resistance requires new antibacterial concepts for selective targeting and killing of pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the synthesis of a heteromultivalent nanogel system against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). These nanogels are based on biocompatible polyglycerols and functionalized with sugar ligands fucose (Fuc) or galactose (Gal) for P. aeruginosa targeting. With a further modification of these nanogels with BMAP&#8208;18 short chain peptides (GRFKRFRKKFKKLFKKLS), we have achieved&#160;&gt;&#160;99.99% inactivation of planktonic and&#160;&gt;&#160;99.9% inactivation of biofilm&#8208;coated P. aeruginosa within 12 h of treatment. Additionally, the system demonstrates broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial potential, effectively inhibiting Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This modular design offers a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation antimicrobial therapies targeting biofilm&#8208;associated infections and MDR bacteria.

         <title>Integrating the Substituent Effect into the Wade&#8211;Mingos Rules for Dicarboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new substituent&#8208;counting rule, P&#160;= nM + 1.1nH, incorporates substituent effects into the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules. By analyzing 74613 six&#8208;vertex dicarboranes, the trigonal&#8208;bipyrimidal isomer dominates at 89.1%, compared to the octagedron at 9.1%, providing a new platform for cluster design.








Abstract
This work revisits the Wade&#8211;Mingos (W&#8211;M) rules in carborane chemistry by showing that substituent effects, rather than skeletal electron pairs alone, determine ground&#8208;state architectures. We performed high&#8208;throughput computational analysis of 74613 six&#8208;vertex dicarboranes (C2B4R6), using the newly proposed Seed and Mortise&#8208;Tenon model, achieving a prediction accuracy of 92.8%. Through this analysis, we derived a simple substituent&#8208;counting rule (P&#160;= nM&#160;+ 1.1nH) that incorporates substituent electronegativity via connected&#8208;atom electronegativity (CAEN) to predict energetic stability. According to this rule, the previously underestimated trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal isomer emerges as the global ground state in 89.1% of the cases, whereas the W&#8211;M&#8208;predicted octahedral form accounts for only 9.1%. This inversion can be explained by electronic stabilization involving vacant orbitals of tricoordinate boron atoms. To rationalize these trends, we classified the studied carboranes into 28 domains defined by CAEN environments. Our analysis shows that substituent effects control the electronic balance between basic and acidic subfragments, a factor neglected in classical frameworks. The W&#8211;M rules fail in 27 of the 28 domains, remaining valid only for L&#8208;CAEN substituents (P&#160;=&#160;0). Collectively, these results establish a substituent&#8208;guided design framework and showcase how data&#8208;driven approaches can refine bonding rules in cluster chemistry.

         <title>Pollutants Transformation During the Regeneration Process of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluid catalytic cracking is the main pollutant source in crude oil refineries due to spent catalyst regeneration. In this work, flue gas pollutants are monitored and coke deposits are identified. Operando and in situ spectroscopy are developed to explore coke species evolution, coupled with online gas infrared spectroscopy to detect pollutant formation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the gradual transformation mechanism from coke toward pollutants genesis is revealed.








Abstract
Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the major process for heavy oil conversion in current refineries and is explored for the intake of renewable feedstocks, like biomass and plastic waste. Due to coke deposition, FCC catalysts undergo continuous reaction&#8208;regeneration cycles. However, many gas pollutants are generated in the FCC regeneration process, and their emission characteristics and formation mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we conducted stack tests of three industrial FCC units to monitor pollutant emissions. The spent catalysts were characterized to identify the carbon deposits formed. We developed a method to correlate the decomposition of carbon deposits and the formation of gas pollutants in regeneration experiments using in situ Raman spectroscopy, operando FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy, and online gas&#8208;phase FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The evolution of coke species is significantly influenced by the oxygen content of the regeneration gas, leading to differences in emission concentration and formation temperature of various gas pollutants. The experimental results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explain the formation of the major gas pollutants. This work is expected to advance pollutant emission prediction and control in FCC regeneration, thereby laying the foundation of future work in which different fossil&#8208;based and renewable feedstock compositions can be compared, including their effect on gas pollutant formation.

         <title>Electroactive Chelating Groups Enable High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>

Introducing electroactive chelating groups can not only increase the proportion of active sites within the electrode, enhancing capacity, but also facilitate the formation of stable zinc&#8208;supramolecular networks, which mitigate the dissolution of electrode materials and suppress the OER, leading to improved cycling stability.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials, characterized by fast kinetics and high redox potential, hold great promise for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but suffer from low capacity and limited cycling stability in practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of electroactive chelating groups can significantly improve both the capacity and cycling stability of p&#8208;type triphenylamine derivative&#8208;based electrodes. The electroactive chelating groups promote a higher proportion of electroactive sites within the cathode material. The combined in/ex situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical investigations show that electroactive chelating groups facilitate the formation of stable zinc&#8208;supramolecular network, which effectively mitigates the dissolution of electrode materials and the decomposition of the aqueous electrolyte during cycling. The as&#8208;synthesized poly(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tri(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 311 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance (199 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1) in aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, it demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 83% to 96% of its capacity over 5000 cycles in various aqueous electrolytes, representing a new record for p&#8208;type and bipolar&#8208;type organic electrode materials. This work provides valuable insights into the design of organic electrode materials for high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Uncovering the Electrochemical Origin of Alkalization in Viologen&#8208;Based Aqueous Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers a two&#8208;stage alkalization mechanism in viologen anolytes: an initial irreversible pH rise driven by hydrogen evolution at low reduction potentials, followed by quasi&#8208;reversible pH oscillations from structural interconversion between quaternary ammonium and pyridinic nitrogen sites. By leveraging these mechanistic insights, a 3 M KCl supporting electrolyte suppresses alkalization, enabling a 2 M electron&#8208;transfer AORFB with energy density of 66.9 Wh Lanolyte&#8722;1${{\rm L}_{\rm anolyte}}^{-1}$ and stability of 99.25%/day over 200 cycles. 








Abstract
Alkalization of viologen&#8208;based anolytes during charge&#8211;discharge cycling poses a formidable obstacle to the practical implementation of aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) by promoting molecular degradation and accelerating capacity decay. This effect is most severe under 2&#8208;electron transfer conditions, which hinder the full exploitation of viologen's redox potential and thereby limit the attainable energy density. To uncover the origin of this phenomenon, we developed a multimodal in situ pH&#8208;gas chromatography&#8208;AORFB characterization platform that reveals a two&#8208;stage alkalization mechanism. In Stage&#160;I, hydrogen evolution reactions dominate at low reduction potentials, driving a rapid and irreversible pH rise; In Stage&#160;II, quasi&#8208;reversible interconversion between quaternary ammonium and pyridinic nitrogen sites engenders sustained pH oscillations. Guided by these insights, we employed a 3&#160;M KCl supporting electrolyte in viologen anolyte, enabling the AORFB with 2&#160;M electron transfer to deliver a practical energy density of 66.9&#160;Wh Lanolyte&#8722;1${{\rm L}_{\rm anolyte}}^{-1}$ and retain 99.25%/day capacity retention rate over 200 cycles. This study not only advances the understanding of the alkalization mechanism in viologen&#8208;based anolytes but also establishes a broadly applicable framework for the design of durable electrolytes for AORFBs.

         <title>An Organic Sacrificial Salt with Low Decomposition Potential Driven by Substituent Effect Enables High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Lithium N,N&#8208;dimethylglycinate (Li&#8208;DMG) was reported as a sacrificial salt to compensate for the capacity loss in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Through molecular engineering, Li&#8208;DMG achieved a low decomposition potential (3.54&#160;V versus Li+/Li), attributed to the elevated highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (&#8722;7.78&#160;eV). The Li&#8208;DMG&#8208;incorporated LiFePO4||graphite LIB exhibited promoted electrochemical performance than the LIB without Li&#8208;DMG.








Abstract
The irreversible Li+ loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation significantly critically constrains the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). To address this issue, we rationally design lithium N,N&#8208;dimethylglycinate (Li&#8208;DMG) as an organic sacrificial salt (OSS) via substituent effect engineering, achieving a low decomposition potential (3.58&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li). Li&#8208;DMG delivers a near&#8208;theoretical capacity (238.2 mAh g&#8722;1, 96% efficiency) during initial charging. Incorporated into LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, Li&#8208;DMG/LFP||graphite full cells exhibit 17.3% higher initial discharge capacity (114.4&#160;versus 97.5 mAh g&#8722;1) and 43.1% enhanced capacity retention after 200 cycles (67.1&#160;versus 46.9 mAh g&#8722;1) compared to LFP||graphite full cells. Besides, Li&#8208;DMG promotes the formation of SEI layer rich in more inorganic component, e.g., LiF, suppressing the degradation of electrolyte solvents and electrode structures. Furthermore, pouch&#8208;type LIBs containing Li&#8208;DMG demonstrate a prominent enhancement in the specific capacity (114.4&#160;versus 87.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) and cycle stability (59.0&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles versus 45.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles). This study provides a promising strategy for improving the energy density and cycle stability of LIBs through the use of OSSs with low decomposition potentials.

         <title>Realization of a Heteroatom&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Ligand (HTL) Platform: Oxy Insertion at a Titanium&#8211;Alkyl Bond Facilitated by a Hydroxylaminato Ligand Framework</title>

A concept for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond functionalization: a Heteroatom&#8208;Transfer Ligand (HTL) platform is demonstrated through oxygen insertion into a titanium&#8208;carbon bond using a hydroxylamide ligand. A synthetic cycle for HTL is presented including kinetic and computational studies.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of metal&#8208;carbon bonds is arguably one of the most important reactions in modern chemistry. In this work, we report the synthesis and the reactivity of a titanium alkyl complex [(TriNOx)Ti(CH2SiMe3)] (TriNOx3&#8722; = [(2&#8208;tBuNO)C6H4CH2]3&#160;N)3&#8211;) that was found to undergo an internal rearrangement through an oxy&#8208;insertion into the Ti&#9472;C bond facilitated by one of the hydroxylaminato moieties of the supporting TriNOx3&#8722; ligand. Experimental and computational studies are in agreement with an organometallic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger&#8208;type mechanism. Furthermore, stepwise dealkoxylation, reoxidation, and alkylation of the resulting complex allowed for closing a synthetic cycle and regenerating the initial starting complex. This work demonstrates the unique ability of the TriNOx3&#8722; ligand to mediate and manage O&#8208;atoms in the coordination sphere of a titanium cation and delineates a new type of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity through a Heteroatom&#8208;Transfer Ligand (HTL) platform.

         <title>2D Assemblies Based on a Tetraphenylethylene D,L&#8208;Cyclic Peptide Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new scaffold based on four nanotube&#8208;forming cyclic peptide units attached to a tetraphenylethene (TPE) core with pH&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly that provides light&#8208;emitting 2D nanosheets with controlled thickness is described.








Abstract
Two dimensional (2D) materials and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores have recently gained attention due to their unique properties and application potential. However, the combination of AIE probes into 2D self&#8208;assembled systems under nanometric control remains elusive due to the sensitivity of supramolecular assemblies to subtle changes in the monomer structure. Herein, we present a new scaffold based on four nanotube&#8208;forming cyclic peptide (CP) units attached to a tetraphenylethene (TPE) core whose pH&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly results in light&#8208;emitting 2D nanosheets. An oxime bond connection was exploited to synthesize a discrete library of tetrakis&#8208;(cyclopeptide) tetraphenylethene monomers that self&#8208;assemble into 2D macrotubular nanoarrays under the suitable external stimulus. This new tetrameric CP motif tolerates a broad range of molecular modifications, both on the peptide backbone and TPE core, without compromising the integrity of the 2D self&#8208;assembly. We also discovered that adjusting the molecular structure of the TPE aromatic core enabled precise height control of the supramolecular nanosheets. The alignment of the histidine residues within neighboring CPs allowed the application of 2D nanoarchitectures as enzyme mimics with esterase activity. The excellent tolerance to molecular diversity in both the external CP moiety and the internal aromatic AIE core, invites the design of new functional 2D supramolecular materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Single Electron Transfer Enables General Visible Light C&#9472;X (S, SS, Se) Coupling via Carbonyl Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by Marcus theory, we developed a redox&#8208;pair screening strategy that identified optimal triplet&#8208;state pathways. This revealed an ultrafast single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process near the diffusion limit, enabling a novel dual&#8208;functionalization of &#945;&#8208;diketones for efficient C&#9472;X (X&#160;=&#160;SS, S, Se) bond formation under mild, redox&#8208;neutral conditions, showcasing both mechanistic innovation and synthetic utility.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;heteroatom bonds is a key strategy that enables the modular construction of molecules in synthetic chemistry, but activating inert carbonyl compounds to forge C&#9472;X bonds remains a longstanding synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a universal visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic system that enables efficient C&#9472;X (X&#160;=&#160;SS, S, Se) bond formation under mild, redox&#8211;neutral conditions. Guided by Marcus electron transfer theory, we employed a computational redox&#8208;pair screening strategy to identify triplet&#8208;state pathways with optimal electronic coupling matrix element (Hif) and thermodynamic alignment. High&#8208;level multireference calculations confirmed an ultrafast single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism with ultrafast kinetics approaching the diffusion limit. To translate this mechanistic insight into a functional platform, we designed a dual&#8208;functionalization strategy for &#945;&#8208;diketones, wherein one carbonyl acts as a conventional synthon while the other forms a light&#8208;responsive dihydroquinazolinone (DHQZ) radical precursor. This system exhibits broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and compatibility with late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive scaffolds. Overall, this study establishes a general and mechanistically predictive photocatalytic strategy that transforms Marcus theory from a conceptual foundation into a design principle for efficient, light&#8208;driven C&#9472;heteroatom bond construction.

Abstract
A chiral sulfide&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H sulfenylation reaction for the efficient synthesis of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing aza&#8208;[5]helicenes has been developed for the first time. The chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamine (BINAM)&#8208;derived sulfide, bearing a tert&#8208;butyl group, was identified as the optimal catalyst. The transformation proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, attributed to the low rotational energy barrier of the indole substrates. This approach features simple and mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate scope (41 examples). A diverse range of chiral sulfur&#8208;containing aza&#8208;[5]helicenes were obtained in high to excellent yields with high to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 97% ee). Furthermore, this catalytic system demonstrates applicability for the modification of drug molecules and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that &#960;&#8943;&#960; and C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a critical role in determining the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Zn2+ Storage via Conversion Chemistry of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 in an Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ in organic electrolytes limits Zn2+ storage performance of MnO2 electrodes. Here, adding 2&#160;vol% H2O to an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte significantly accelerates the de&#8208;solvation process and thus enhancing the capacity and cycle life of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 electrodes via initial MnO2 dissolution and ZnO formation during discharge, followed by highly reversible conversion between Mn2++ZnO and layered ZnMn3O7.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese oxide batteries have attracted considerable attention for energy storage applications due to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, unavoidable proton&#8208;involved electrode reactions in mild aqueous electrolytes often lead to significant pH fluctuations and accelerated Zn corrosion, resulting in limited operational lifespans (typically less than 1000&#160;h) for most reported Zn//MnO2 cells. Herein, we investigate the Zn2+ storage behavior of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 in 1&#160;M zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2)/N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte, which delivers negligible capacity due to sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation. Remarkably, introducing a small amount (2&#160;vol%) of water into the DMF&#8208;based electrolyte substantially improves Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics, thereby enhancing the storage performance of the &#945;&#8208;MnO2 electrode without proton participation. We reveal that in this electrolyte, the &#945;&#8208;MnO2 undergoes initial dissolution and ZnO formation during discharge, followed by a highly reversible conversion between Mn2+&#160;+&#160;ZnO and layered ZnMn3O7. Benefiting from the reversible Zn2+ storage mechanism and suppressed Zn corrosion, the Zn//&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell operates stably for 132 days at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and retains 87.1% of its capacity after 1200 cycles. This work offers a new proton&#8208;free conversion reaction pathway for constructing stable Zn&#8211;Mn batteries based on organic electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;The sluggish de-solvation of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in organic electrolytes limits Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage performance of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese oxide batteries have attracted considerable attention for energy storage applications due to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, unavoidable proton-involved electrode reactions in mild aqueous electrolytes often lead to significant pH fluctuations and accelerated Zn corrosion, resulting in limited operational lifespans (typically less than 1000&#160;h) for most reported Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells. Herein, we investigate the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage behavior of &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 1&#160;M zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/&lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte, which delivers negligible capacity due to sluggish Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation. Remarkably, introducing a small amount (2&#160;vol%) of water into the DMF-based electrolyte substantially improves Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation kinetics, thereby enhancing the storage performance of the &#945;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode without proton participation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;nido&#8208;carborane&#8208;protected copper nanoclusters, an octahedral Cu6 and a superatomic icosahedral Cu13 have been fabricated for the first time. Cu6 undergoes a spontaneous transformation into Cu13 in acetone solution. Moreover, Cu13 exhibits near&#8208;infrared luminescence in both solution and solid states and demonstrates exceptional performance in vitro for bioimaging.








Abstract
Peripheral ligands of metal nanoclusters play a crucial role in determining their structures and modulating their physicochemical properties. Therefore, expanding the diversity of ligands is of paramount importance for advancing metal cluster science. In this work, we report for the first time the synthesis and characterization of two all&#8208;nido&#8208;carborane&#8208;protected copper nanoclusters: an octahedral [Cu6(C2B9H11)4](Et4N)2 (Cu6) and an icosahedral [Cu13(C2B9H11)6](Et4N)3 (Cu13) (Et4N&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium). As confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS and time&#8208;dependent UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, Cu6 undergoes spontaneous transformation into Cu13 in acetone solution. Theoretical computations reveal that the superatomic cluster Cu13 possesses an open&#8208;shell electronic structure of 1S21P2. Moreover, Cu13 solution exhibits prominent near&#8208;infrared luminescence at 880&#160;nm and demonstrates superior performance in bioimaging with 4T1 cells, showcasing significant potential for biomedical applications. This study not only enriches the ligand library for metal clusters but also provides new impetus for the exploration of carborane chemistry.

         <title>Solvent's Covert Role: Concerted Anion&#8208;Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation Rewrites Voltage Rules for Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>

Operando Raman reveals concerted solvent&#8208;anion co&#8208;intercalation in graphite cathodes, redefining dual&#8208;ion battery thermodynamics via a donor number&#8208;dielectric constant (DN&#8208;&#949;) descriptor. This enables predictive voltage control and electrolyte design for energy&#8208;dense dual&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Anion intercalation into graphite cathodes governs dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) performance but suffers from unexplained solvent&#8208;driven voltage shifts (&gt;500&#160;mV) and capacity variations (12&#8208;fold) across electrolyte solvents. Prevailing thermodynamic models overlook solvent involvement due to unresolved anion&#8208;solvent coupling dynamics. Using a spatially resolved operando Raman platform, we detect solvent&#8208;specific vibrational fingerprints and graphite G&#8208;band splitting at identical intercalation thresholds, confirming simultaneous anion&#8208;solvent insertion. This redefines solvents as active thermodynamic directors, revealing two hidden energetic contributions: 1) cation desolvation penalties governed by solvent donor number (DN) and 2) dielectric constant (&#949;)&#8208;modulated screening between anions and graphene layers. Integrating these into a revised Nernst model yields a DN&#8208;&#949; descriptor that quantitatively predicts intercalation voltages across solvents. We further demonstrate that salt&#8208;concentrated electrolytes disrupt this mechanism by depleting solvent activity, shifting pathways from co&#8208;intercalation to anion&#8208;dominant insertion. This work resolves long&#8208;standing DIB anomalies in anion&#8208;inserted graphite cathode reactions and establishes solvent properties as central levers for energy&#8208;dense DIBs.

         <title>Tailoring &#960;--d$\pi {\text{--}}d$ Magnetic Interactions in Metallated Porphyrin Nanotapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand how &#960;$\pi$&#8208;radicals and d$d$&#8208;electrons interact within molecular nanostructures, we have studied metallated porphyrin nanotapes synthesized on gold surfaces. We reveal element&#8208;specific results: with Fe centers the ferromagnetic &#960;$\pi$&#8208;d$d$ exchange dominates, while with Co centers the metal&#8211;metal exchange overpowers the &#960;$\pi$&#8208;d$d$ exchange, with Kondo&#8208;screened ligand spins, highlighting porphyrin nanotapes as a versatile platform for designer 1D magnetism.








Abstract
Molecular assemblies based on porphyrins (Pors), specifically Por nanotapes (NTs) containing magnetic metal ions, offer a versatile platform to explore magnetic interactions arising from the electronic interplay between &#960;$\pi$&#8208;conjugated ligands and transition metal d&#8208;orbitals. Using on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum, we synthesized &#960;$\pi$&#8208;extended PorNTs of different lengths incorporating magnetic metal ions such as Fe and Co on Au(111). We resolved their atomic structure using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Differential conductance (dI/dV${\rm d}I/{\rm d}V$) measurements, interpreted by extensive density functional theory calculations and theoretical modeling, reveal two distinct magnetic behaviors for the Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;based systems. In FePorNTs, the magnetic interactions are dominated by strong Fe&#8211;ligand ferromagnetic coupling and weak antiferromagnetic Fe&#8211;Fe coupling. By contrast, CoPorNTs exhibit stronger Co&#8211;Co antiferromagnetic exchange and weaker Co&#8211;ligand coupling, with Kondo screening evident at the ligand sites. Our findings underscore the profound influence of metal centers, ligands, and substrate interactions on the magnetic and electronic properties of PorNTs, establishing these assemblies as interesting building blocks for low&#8208;dimensional magnetism and future spintronic or quantum&#8208;material&#160;applications.

         <title>Engineering Proton Clamp Traps in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Capture and Photoreduction</title>

A series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with proton clamps were constructed by using an S&#8208;shaped building unit, creating highly effective confinement sites for CO2 capture and photoreduction. This work provides a novel design paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.








Abstract
The targeted construction of efficient CO2 capture platforms for photocatalysis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we precisely engineered a proton clamp within a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to function as CO2 traps, thereby significantly enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The proton clamp was rationally designed by using an S&#8208;shaped molecular motif featuring appropriate interatomic distances and strategically positioned protonation sites. Remarkably, the protonated COFs exhibited a superior CO production rate of 109 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in a gas&#8208;solid reaction condition. The experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed that the proton clamp not only facilitated efficient CO2 trapping but also rapidly delivered protons to the active sites, accelerating the reaction kinetics. This work provides molecular&#8208;level insights into protonation strategies for optimizing photocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering a new design principle for advanced COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Flipping of a Non&#8208;productive Substrate Binding Conformation Facilitates Hydroxynitrile Lyase Catalyzed Hydrocyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;productive substrate binding conformation was identified in the PcHNL5L331A mutant by crystallography and computation. Destabilizing this state through mutagenesis led to a triple mutant with enhanced hydrocyanation activity. These findings highlight a strategy to improve enzyme function by targeting unfavorable states associated with substrate binding.








Abstract
Understanding enzyme&#8211;substrate conformational transformations is crucial to the design and engineering of biocatalysts. However, the mechanisms by which substrates undergo dynamic transformations that regulate the function of an enzyme remain poorly understood. Hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) catalyzes the cleavage of cyanohydrins. Its reverse reaction holds significant synthetic potential for the preparation of pharmaceutical precursors. Using a combination of crystallography and computational experiments, a novel flipped substrate binding state is identified within the substrate tunnel of the PcHNL5L331A mutant. This binding state is non&#8208;productive and undergoes a conformational change before the catalytic cycle can proceed. Site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis led to the discovery of a triple mutant, PcHNL5L331A/S333V/P340L, that destabilizes the non&#8208;productive substrate binding state thereby facilitating its transition to the catalytically productive conformation and significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. Crystallographic studies provide a structural description of the factors that stabilize versus destabilize the different binding conformers in the different enzyme variants and thus the differing catalytic efficiencies. These findings demonstrate that destabilizing unfavorable substrate binding conformations within an enzyme active site can improve functionality and provide a promising strategy for designing efficient biocatalysts.

         <title>Stable Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery Realized by Polyacrylamide as Catalytic Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable iodine&#8208;based four&#8208;electron transfer mechanism (I+/I0/I&#8208; redox couple) is realized by deploying polyacrylamide (PAM) as the cathode binder, in which p&#8208;&#960; conjugated amide groups exhibit strong binding with I+, leading to higher capacity and voltage in zinc&#8208;iodine battery.








Abstract
Realizing stable four&#8208;electron reactions (I&#8722;/I20/I+${{\mathrm{I}}^{\mathrm{ - }}}{\mathrm{/I}}_{\mathrm{2}}^{\mathrm{0}}{\mathrm{/}}{{\mathrm{I}}^ + }$) is the key to boosting the energy density of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs). In most of the traditional studies, the four&#8208;electron reactions are realized by catalytic halogen ions as electrolyte additives. Herein, we utilize commercial polyacrylamide (PAM) powder as a cost&#8208;friendly electrode binder to catalyze the stable interconversion between I0 and I+, enabling a four&#8208;electron reaction in the absence of halogen ions. We show that PAM obtained from various suppliers can serve as a catalytic binder and induce the 4e reactions due to the presence of a large amount of nucleophilic&#160;&#8722;CONH2 group, which strongly binds with I+. Furthermore, PAM also exhibits a strong affinity to polyiodide species, which suppresses the polyiodide shuttling and thus mitigates the anode side reactions between polyiodide and Zn. As a result of the above two beneficial effects, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 416 mAh g&#8722;1 (calculated from available iodine mass in electrolyte) and an extended cycle life of over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This low&#8208;cost and fluorine&#8208;free commercial binder for four&#8208;electron iodine reaction will boost the progress of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Polyesters, CO2, and Glycerol via Ethylene Oxide&#8208;Mediated Tandem Process</title>

The one&#8208;pot cycloaddition&#8211;transesterification&#8211;glycolysis (CTG) tandem process achieved the efficient co&#8208;conversion of PET, CO2, and glycerol into bis&#8208;hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and glycerol carbonate&#8212;produced in yields of 92% and 99%, respectively, under mild temperatures (60&#8211;110&#160;&#176;C) without additional solvents or acidic/alkaline conditions.








Abstract
The co&#8208;conversion of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), CO2, and renewable carbon resources offers a sustainable strategy for reducing plastic waste and carbon emissions, but remains challenging. Here, we develop a one&#8208;pot cycloaddition&#8211;transesterification&#8211;glycolysis (CTG) tandem process to efficiently convert PET, CO2, and glycerol into bis&#8208;hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and glycerol carbonate, achieving yields of 92% and 99%, respectively. The process begins with the cycloaddition of ethylene oxide and CO2 in an ionic liquid, followed by transesterification with glycerol to produce glycerol carbonate and ethylene glycol. The in situ&#8208;generated ethylene glycol participates in PET glycolysis to yield BHET catalyzed by zinc acetate. Kinetic studies, isotope labelling, and theoretical calculations reveal that ethylene oxide serves two functions: (i) swelling the PET matrix to enhance mass transfer and (ii) providing ethylene glycol. The synchronized kinetics of cycloaddition, transesterification, and glycolysis enable ethylene oxide to play both roles effectively, significantly accelerating PET depolymerization at mild temperatures.

         <title>Cu&#8211;Mg Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with CO Spillover for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8211;Mg dual single&#8208;atom catalyst with Mg&#8211;N2 and Cu&#8211;N2 coordination was structured, in which Mg&#8211;N2 sites activate CO2 to *CO that migrates to adjacent Cu&#8211;N2 centers for hydrogenation to CH4. Benefited from the site&#8208;specific *CO spillover pathway, the optimized CuN2&#8211;MgN2 electrocatalyst achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 78.3% and a partial current density of 228.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE under ambient CO2 conditions.

Selective electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to CH4 remains a significant challenge due to the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process and competing C&#9472;C coupling pathways. Here, a Cu&#8211;Mg dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (CuN2&#8211;MgN2), which enables a spatially confined CO spillover mechanism was constructed. Spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the atomically dispersed Mg sites not only modulate the electronic structure of Cu sites to lower the overall energy barrier of the CO2RR to CH4, but also efficiently activate CO2 to form *CO intermediates, which subsequently migrate to adjacent Cu sites to further hydrogenate into CH4. Leveraging these dual advantages, the optimized CuN2&#8211;MgN2 electrocatalyst achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 78.3% and a partial current density of 228.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at&#8722;1.1&#160;V versus RHE under ambient CO2 conditions, with the Turnover frequency of CH4 on Cu single sites reaching up to 1.72 s&#8722;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. This work not only reveals the dynamic regulation mechanism of intermediates during CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at the atomic scale but also establishes a universal theoretical model for designing industrial&#8208;grade electrocatalysts with well&#8208;defined active site configurations.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Probes Enhance in Vivo Field&#8208;Effect Transistor&#8208;Based Biosensing by Overcoming Debye Length Limitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We here designed and synthesized small molecules (approximately 1&#160;nm in size) as the recognition probes to construct the needle FET biosensor to overcome the Debye screening limitation and maintain the sensor's sensitivity in biological environments. This allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of ATP level and its dynamic variations in both normal and depressed mice in vivo, providing a new solution of FET sensor for in vivo applications.








Abstract
Field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) biosensors have garnered extensive interest in biomedical detection, while their high sensitivity is maintained only when the targets are within the Debye length. In high&#8208;ionic&#8208;strength biological environments, the Debye length could be reduced to ca. 1&#160;nm, but the size of traditional recognition probes such as antibodies and aptamers far exceeds the Debye length, therefore significantly compromising the sensitivity. Here, inspired by fluorescent probes, we designed and synthesized small molecules (approximately 1&#160;nm in size) as the recognition probes to overcome the Debye length limitation and maintain the sensor's sensitivity in biological environments. Upon binding to target molecules, the probe triggers a change in the surface charge of the FET sensing channel and generate a quantifiable electronic signal. As a proof of concept, an ATP&#8208;responsive Small Molecules probe functionalIzed needLE (SMILE) FET biosensor was developed, which exhibited excellent affinity, selectivity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 82 fM toward detection of ATP in physiological solution. This allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of ATP level and its dynamic variations in both normal and depressed mice, providing a new solution of FET sensor for in vivo applications.

         <title>Elucidating Highly Activated Transition Metal Redox Chemistry in Low&#8208;Nickel O3&#8208;Type Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronic structure tuning strategy based on multi&#8208;cationic compositional regulation was employed to deeply activate transition metal redox couples, enabling the development of a high&#8208;capacity, low&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathode. This approach enhances reversible capacity and optimizes the interlayer structure, effectively suppressing structural distortion and multiphase transitions during cycling, while also mitigating crack formation over long&#8208;term operation. As anticipated, the designed NMFMC||HC Ah&#8208;level pouch cell demonstrates excellent rate performance and cycling stability.








Abstract
Low&#8208;nickel O3&#8208;type layered oxides have emerged as cost&#8208;effective cathode candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical viability is challenged by rapid capacity decay and insufficient redox activity within safe voltage windows. Here, we report a multi&#8208;cationic compositional regulation strategy for Na0.96Ni0.2Mn0.32Fe0.4Mg0.04Cu0.04O2 (NMFMC), which tunes the energy levels of transition metal (TM) 3d orbitals to enhance two&#8208;electron Ni2+/Ni4+ redox activity and facilitate cooperative Fe3+ oxidation. This approach unlocks a 17% capacity enhancement (2.0&#8211;4.0&#160;V) over conventional low&#8208;Ni cathodes while maintaining structural integrity. Operando measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the reinforced TM&#9472;O bonding upon Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping mitigates structural distortion and suppresses multiphase transitions, thereby enabling superior cycling stability. A 2.65 Ah NMFMC||hard carbon pouch cell maintains 80% capacity after 1600 cycles at 1C and preserves 94% capacity when cycled from 0.5C to 4C, demonstrating practical potential for grid&#8208;scale storage. By elucidating the interplay between orbital hybridization, redox chemistry, and structural evolution, this work establishes fundamental design principles for high&#8208;energy, durable SIB's cathodes while advancing sustainable large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions.

         <title>From Pharmacophore to Warhead: NAD+&#8208;Targeting Triazoles as Mechanism&#8208;Based Sirtuin Inhibitors</title>

We report &#8220;Sirtuin Trapping Ligands&#8221; (SirTraps), mechanism&#8208;based 1,2,3&#8208;triazole inhibitors that hijack sirtuin (SIRT) catalysis to form covalent triazolium&#8211; or triazole&#8211;ADP&#8208;ribose (ADPR) adducts from NAD+. These trapped intermediates stall the enzyme in an inactive state, providing a biocompatible alternative to thiocarbonyl inhibitors and a blueprint for targeting other NAD+&#8208;dependent enzymes.








Abstract
Sirtuins (SIRTs) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases linked to key physiological and disease processes. Here, we report a new class of mechanism&#8208;based 1,2,3&#8208;triazole inhibitors that hijack SIRT catalysis by forming stalled triazolium&#8211; or triazole&#8211;ADP&#8208;ribose (ADPR) adducts derived from the cofactor NAD+. These trapped adducts inhibit the enzyme without covalent protein modification, prompting us to term the compounds &#8220;Sirtuin Trapping Ligands&#8221; (SirTraps). X&#8208;ray crystallography and kinetics, together with mass spectrometry confirming adduct formation both in vitro and in cellulo, reveal that the triazole N3 of peptide&#8208; and small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based SirTraps triggers nucleophilic attack at C1&#8217; of the nicotinamide riboside moiety of NAD&#8314;, mimicking the first deacylation step. Adduct formation critically depends on precise triazole positioning within the acyl&#8208;lysine channel and can be tuned through scaffold design, enabling potent and isoform&#8208;selective inhibition. Unlike thiocarbonyl&#8208;based NAD&#8314;&#8208;targeting SIRT inhibitors, which may suffer from instability and off&#8208;target effects, SirTraps combine high stability, synthetic accessibility, and structural tunability, while demonstrating nanomolar cellular target engagement confirmed by NanoBRET assays. Beyond SIRTs, this inhibition strategy may extend to other NAD&#8314;&#8208;dependent enzymes, including ADP&#8208;ribosyltransferases, opening new avenues for mechanism&#8208;driven drug discovery.

         <title>A Smart Self&#8208;Immobilization Magnetic Resonance Contrast Agent for Delayed Tumor Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ALP&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immobilizing small&#8208;molecule contrast probe was designed, enabling the generation of reactive quinone methide intermediates for efficient proximity labeling of tumor cell membranes with high&#8208;density Gd&#8208;chelates, thereby facilitating delayed magnetic resonance imaging of tumors with enhanced sensitivity and spatial resolution.








Abstract
Achieving tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and high relaxivity remains critical yet challenging for improving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe sensitivity. Here, we present P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd, an enzyme&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;immobilizing small&#8208;molecule MRI probe designed for high&#8208;sensitivity tumor imaging. Upon activation by membrane&#8208;bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP), P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd is enzymatically converted to generate reactive quinone methide intermediates. These intermediates readily undergo nucleophilic addition with proximal protein residues, enabling the covalent conjugation of paramagnetic gadolinium complexes directly onto tumor cell membranes. This enzymatic self&#8208;immobilization markedly increased the longitudinal relaxivity (r1) from 7.35 to 13.15 mM&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (0.5 T, 21.3&#160;MHz, 32&#160;&#176;C) and effectively &#8220;traps&#8221; the probe at the tumor site. P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd showed rapid tumor uptake and efficient covalent labeling, achieving distinct MR contrast enhancement (&gt; 60%). The imaging window was extended for up to 24&#160;h in subcutaneous HeLa and orthotopic K7M2 tumor models. Notably, delayed MRI with P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd enabled precision visualization of &#8764;1.3&#160;mm orthotopic K7M2 tumors in mice. By overcoming the rapid washout and low sensitivity inherent to traditional small&#8208;molecule MRI probes through this enzymatic self&#8208;immobilization strategy, P&#8208;QM&#8208;Gd offers a promising approach for high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;spatial resolution delayed tumor MRI, making it particularly effective for early&#8208;stage lesion detection.

         <title>Optical Switching of Catalytic Pathways for Hydrogen Generation via Light&#8208;Handedness Control on Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the interface between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis, a chiral Au@CdS nanocatalyst system enables reversible switching between photocatalytic and photothermal hydrogen production by tuning light handedness, leveraging the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect to achieve optically controlled spin&#8208;selective reactivity and enhanced solar&#8208;driven methanol reforming.








Abstract
Precise optical control over catalytic pathways remains a major challenge in solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production. Here, we report a reversible light&#8208;handedness&#8208;dependent switching mechanism between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis using a standard Au@CdS nanocatalyst functionalized with chiral cysteine ligands. The switching behavior is governed by the interplay of chemical chirality and circularly polarized light, mediated by the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect. When the handedness of circularly polarized light matches the catalyst's chirality, spin&#8208;polarized carriers are efficiently transferred, favoring photocatalysis. In contrast, mismatched conditions suppress charge transfer, enhance recombination, and induce localized heating, shifting the reaction toward photothermal catalysis. Tuning the handedness of circularly polarized light to mismatch the catalyst chirality induces a significant photothermal effect, with temperatures reaching 343 K and hydrogen evolution rates of up to 4.8 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, doubling the performance in the matched case. This study introduces a light&#8208;handedness&#8208;controlled catalytic switch that enables dynamic modulation between two reaction modes using the same chiral catalyst, advancing our mechanistic understanding of spin&#8208;dependent photothermal phenomena and establishing a versatile platform for optically tunable solar fuel production. The interaction of chemical and optical chirality offers a novel approach to designing next&#8208;generation photocatalysts that can be tailored for energy conversion.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Matched Nonpolar Pore Surfaces Enhance Alkane Recognition Toward Natural Gas Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) featuring zigzag aromatic pore channels can achieve specific capture of V&#8208;shaped C3H8 and linear C2H6 molecules from ternary gas mixtures, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of shape&#8208;matched pore architectures and nonpolar pore surfaces.








Abstract
Efficiently removing C3H8 and C2H6 from natural gas remains a formidable challenge in meeting industrial purification demands. Traditional strategies have primarily focused on subtle polarizability differences among alkane molecules, there have been no reported efforts that exploit their substantial shape disparities for separation purposes. Hence, we customized a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Zn&#8208;BPDP, featuring zigzag aromatic pore channels. Zn&#8208;BPDP achieves specific capture of V&#8208;shaped C3H8 and linear C2H6 through the synergistic effect of shape&#8208;matched and nonpolar pore surfaces. Ultimately, Zn&#8208;BPDP exhibits considerable C3/C2 adsorption capacities, along with outstanding C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivities. Under harsh simulated industrial conditions, including high flow rate (4&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1), elevated temperature (318&#160;K), and saturated humidity (RH&#160;=&#160;100%), Zn&#8208;BPDP demonstrates superior separation performance for C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures. Theoretical calculations further indicate that shape&#8208;matched aromatic surfaces provide enlarged contact interfaces with both C3H8 and C2H6 through multiple C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, thereby presenting an innovative approach for natural gas upgrading.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloys Embedded in CeO2 for Polysulfide/Sulfide Bidirectional Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCoMoIr entropy alloy embedded in CeO2 was modified on carbon nanotubes as a functional intercalation of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery to promote the bidirectional catalytic conversion of Li2S6 and Li2S. The results show that the pouch cell at the 2 Ah&#8208;level has an energy density of 436.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, with a capacity decay rate of 0.039% after 800 cycles.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li2S oxidation reaction (SOR) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) seriously affect their practical applications. Herein, we prepared a functional interlayer for LSBs consisting of hydroxylated carbon nanotubes dispersed with NiCoMoIr medium&#8208;entropy alloys embedded in CeO2 surface materials. Experimental results revealed a bidirectional catalytic mechanism involving different elements, verifying that Ir and Ni promote the SRR of Li2S6 to Li2S. Meanwhile, Co and Mo were found to primarily promote the conversion process of Li2S to Li2S6. CeO2 exhibits a bidirectional synergistic effect on enhancing the kinetics of the SRR and SOR. The battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1535.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, and the decay rate is only 0.051% for per&#8208;cycle of 1000 cycles at 1 C. More importantly, a 2 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with an energy density of 436.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and the capacity decay rate was 0.039% per&#8208;cycle after 800 cycles.

We report a safe and scalable flow&#8208;based strategy for the on&#8208;demand generation of NCF2R anions using a packed&#8208;bed microreactor containing CsF. This protocol enables the late&#8208;stage installation of the CF2 group under mild conditions leveraging three points of diversification, allowing efficient access to a broad range of NCF2R scaffolds.








Abstract
The &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylene amine (NCF2R) motif represents a useful functionality in medicinal chemistry, yet practical and modular methods to access this class of compounds are lacking. Here, we report a safe and scalable flow&#8208;based strategy for the on&#8208;demand generation of NCF2R anions using a packed&#8208;bed microreactor containing caesium fluoride. This protocol enables the late&#8208;stage installation of the CF2 group under mild conditions, avoiding the use of hazardous fluorinating agents and minimizing fluorinated waste. This fully modular strategy features three points of diversification (carboxylic acid, sulfonamide, and electrophile), allowing efficient access to a broad range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylene amines. The method tolerates a variety of functional groups, supports late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds, and is compatible with downstream cross&#8208;coupling reactions, demonstrating the robustness of the reaction protocol. This work provides a versatile platform for the streamlined incorporation of NCF2 motifs, expanding the range of synthetic strategies available in medicinal and fluorine chemistry.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transition Intervention Engineered Amorphous Vanadium Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous vanadium oxide (AVO) was prepared via a phase&#8208;transition intervention strategy. It involves intercalating polyaniline (PANI) into layered V2O5&#183;1.6H2O, followed by an annealing transformation to construct an AVO/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (AVO@NC) composite. The PANI&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers enhance AVO's thermodynamic stability, provide efficient electron transfer, and mitigate AVO dissolution through a confinement effect.








Abstract
Amorphous vanadium oxide (AVO) has emerged as a promising cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), combining the high theoretical capacity and low cost of crystalline vanadium oxides with improved kinetics and structural tolerance. However, AVO still faces critical challenges, including thermodynamic instability, poor electrical conductivity, and severe dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which limit its practical application. Herein, we propose a novel &#8220;phase&#8208;transition intervention&#8221; strategy for the synthesis of AVO. In this approach, polyaniline molecules are first intercalated into layered V2O5&#183;1.6H2O, followed by high&#8208;temperature treatment. During the thermally induced phase transition of V2O5&#183;1.6H2O, the intercalated polyaniline molecules undergo in situ carbonization and form nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers, which simultaneously disrupt long&#8208;range crystallinity and promote the formation of AVO confined in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The carbon layers provide the AVO with suppressed dissolution, enhanced electrical conductivity, and improved thermodynamic stability. The resulting composite exhibits excellent AZIB performance, delivering high capacities of 390.5 and 329.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 20.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively, and outstanding cycling stability. This work offers a versatile strategy for designing amorphous electrode materials and opens new directions for high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Homoterpene Biosynthesis in Fungi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homoterpene biosynthetic pathway in the fungal kingdom is reported. A methyltransferase&#8211;terpene cyclase pair produces a unique heptamethyl bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane homoterpene via presodorifen, demonstrating that homoterpene biosynthesis via the addition of a C1 unit to terpene diphosphate precursors prior to scaffold formation extends beyond the bacterial domain to eukaryotes.








Abstract
Homoterpenes carrying an additional methyl group in their carbon backbones are an emerging class of natural products that challenge the biogenic isoprene rule, stating that terpenes are composed of integer multiples of C5 units. We and others have recently shown that biosynthetic pathways to homoterpenes are widespread in bacteria, leading either to specialized scaffolds such as the &#8220;Greek philosophers homoterpenes&#8221; in Pseudomonadota or to simple methyl analogs of central eudesmanes and germacranes (&#8220;humanists homoterpenes&#8221;) in Actinomycetota. Here we report the discovery of the first homoterpene biosynthetic pathway in the fungal kingdom using targeted genomic data mining in combination with in vitro pathway reconstitution. Functional analyses of a fungal methyltransferase (NdiMT) and terpene cyclase (NdiTC) pair from the plant&#8208;pathogenic fungus Neonectria ditissima, the causative agent of apple canker, led to the discovery of a novel homosesquiterpene featuring an intriguing heptamethylbicyclo[3.3.1]nonane scaffold. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the fungus acquired the key methyltransferase via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria, whereas the terpene cyclase appears to have evolved from a fungal ancestor. The discovery raises fundamental questions about the evolutionary rationale and functional consequences of terpene methylation in nature.

         <title>Integrative Ni1&#8211;Px Catalytic Pairs for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart of the Ni&#8211;P integrative catalytic pair (ICP) lies in the dynamic Ni&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;H&#8211;O&#8211;P&#8211;Ni hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring that mediates proton transfer and stabilizes key intermediates. This cooperative interaction unlocks efficient CO2 electroreduction under dilute CO2 feeds.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable electricity offers a promising approach for sustainable carbon utilization. However, under industrially relevant low CO2 concentrations (5&#8211;15&#160;vol.%), the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical CO2RR are significantly constrained by the limited CO2 supply and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report integrative Ni1&#8211;Px catalytic pairs (Ni1&#8211;Px/ICPs) that exhibit super CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency under low&#8208;concentration CO2 conditions. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements show that P incorporation modulates the electrochemical microenvironment and accelerates reaction kinetics. H/D isotopic substitution experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a mechanistic transition from an Eley&#8211;Rideal to Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway, enabled by cooperative adsorption on adjacent Ni and P sites. Notably, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded six&#8208;membered Ni&#8211;C&#8211;O&#8211;H&#8211;O&#8211;P&#8211;Ni ring forms between adsorbed CO2 and H2O, facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and lowering the reaction barrier. This unique adsorption motif enhances CO2 activation, suppresses HER, and enables efficient CO generation at low CO2 concentrations. Our findings show the importance of atomically dispersed catalytic pairs for advancing carbon utilization and overcoming selectivity challenges in electrochemical hydrogenation.

         <title>Directing the Electrochemical C&#9472;N Coupling Toward Efficient Amide Synthesis via Ammonia Activation&#8208;Mediated Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>

An ammonia&#8208;activation mediated pathway is presented to favor the oxidative C&#9472;N coupling necessary for formamide electrosynthesis using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks. This manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH2 species, which exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of unfavorable aldehyde intermediate.








Abstract
Electrochemically oxidative C&#9472;N coupling using alcohol and ammonia as feedstocks offers a sustainable alternative for the chemosynthesis of amide organonitrogens. The achievements of high activity and selectivity yet remains challenging via the conventional alcohol oxidation pathway. Here, we present an alternative ammonia&#8208;activation mediated pathway to favor the electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling necessary. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations untangle that this manipulated process begins with the oxidation of ammonia to endow active *NH2 species, which then efficiently couple with alcohol species to form C&#9472;N bonds. This alternative C&#9472;N coupling pathway exhibits accelerated kinetics and, more importantly, bypasses the formation of aldehyde intermediate, thereby preventing unfavorable overoxidation. As a result, this pathway achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 50.1% and a carbon selectivity of 87.6% for efficient formamide electrosynthesis over a NiCuRu&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, with a productivity of 557.2&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Such electrosynthetic approach further exhibit the universality of waste biomass/plastics&#8208;driven carbon feedstocks, achieving considerable Faradaic efficiencies of 32%&#8211;60%. Techno&#8208;economic analysis confirms the potential profitability of using renewable electricity input, highlighting the significant advantages of green chemical manufacturing for sustainable development.

         <title>An Intrinsically Conductive Cross&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Quinhydrone&#8208;Like Donor&#8211;Acceptor Charge&#8208;Transfer Network</title>

HOT&#8208;DOT, an intrinsically conductive cross&#8208;conjugated polymer, features a covalently integrated, quinhydrone&#8208;like donor&#8211;acceptor network formed through spontaneous air oxidation. This built&#8208;in architecture enables self&#8208;doping, stable polarons, and efficient charge transport without dopants. HOT&#8208;DOT films show high conductivity and rare positive temperature coefficient, offering a new paradigm for organic electronic materials.








Abstract
Intrinsically conductive polymers free of unstable mobile dopants are highly sought after for stable and reliable electronic performance, yet remain scarce due to synthetic challenges. Here we report poly(3,4&#8208;dihydroxythiophene&#8208;alt&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dione) (HOT&#8208;DOT), a novel cross&#8208;conjugated polymer and the first polymeric analogue of a quinhydrone&#8208;like charge&#8208;transfer complex with intrinsic conductivity. HOT&#8208;DOT is synthesized through a straightforward three&#8208;step route, in which the final air oxidation step spontaneously generates a perfectly balanced 1:1 donor&#8211;acceptor architecture that promotes self&#8208;doping and stabilizes polarons. The polymer exhibits a narrow bandgap (1.38&#160;eV), broad near&#8208;infrared absorption, and high conductivity (&#8764;0.29 S cm&#8722;1), enabled by an ultrasmall &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (3.25&#160;&#197;) despite its cross&#8208;conjugated backbone. Spectroscopic and computational analyses reveal that strong interchain donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, reinforced by ammonia coordination, stabilize the self&#8208;doped state. HOT&#8208;DOT further displays rare positive temperature coefficient (PTC) behavior and long&#8208;term ambient stability. As a proof of concept, flexible temperature sensors fabricated from HOT&#8208;DOT films show reproducible and linear thermal responses over multiple cycles. This study establishes polymeric charge&#8208;transfer complexes as a new design paradigm for intrinsically conductive, dopant&#8208;free polymers with distinctive transport and sensing properties.

         <title>Knoevenagel Condensation Enables a High&#8208;Dipole Interfacial Molecule for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecule was synthesized to optimize substrates of invert wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. Ideal substrates with enhanced wettability and promoted conductivity were obtained, meanwhile, modulated crystallization dynamics toward diminished buried defects and released residual stress were simultaneously achieved. The inverted devices and perovskite&#8208;organic tandem device yielded champion PCE of 19.08% and 26.10%, respectively.








Abstract
The rational molecular design of interfacial modifiers is critical for optimizing charge transport and defect passivation in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we introduce a novel multifunctional molecule, (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;cyanovinyl) phenylamine (BCPA), synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation reaction, featuring a highly polar architecture with a ground&#8208;state dipole moment of 18.16 Debye, significantly exceeding that of the benchmark Me&#8208;4PACz (1.60 Debye). This pronounced polarity stems from a synergistic combination of an electropositive ammonium group (&#9472;NH3&#8314;) and electronegative cyano (&#9472;CN) and bromine (&#9472;Br) substituents, which collectively foster strong interfacial dipole&#8211;substrate interactions. The &#9472;CN moiety coordinates with Ni&#739;&#8314; in NiOX and Pb2&#8314; in perovskites, effectively passivating electronic defects and modulating self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM) anchoring. Meanwhile, the &#9472;NH3&#8314; group forms stable bonds with perovskite lattice, modulating crystal growth kinetics, and improving interfacial contact. The Br atom ensures intrinsic compatibility with bromine&#8208;rich wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Notably, the rigid, planar structure of BCPA facilitates ordered SAM packing via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, enhancing interfacial charge extraction. BCPA&#8208;modified hole transport layers significantly improve the buried perovskite/substrate interface by reducing trap densities, enhancing crystallinity, and aligning energy levels. As a result, modified WBG PSCs realized a champion efficiency of 19.08% with reinforced durability. Furthermore, when applied in perovskite&#8208;organic tandem configurations, the devices reach a remarkable PCE of 26.10%, highlighting the importance of interfacial modifier for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics.

         <title>Precise Pore Engineering at Picometer Scale on Nanofluidic Membrane for Efficient Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of HBF membranes with their pore sizes precisely tuned by altering anion linkers (SiF62&#8722;, GeF62&#8722; and TiF62&#8722;, size difference &lt; 1&#160;&#197;) were successfully fabricated for efficient H2 purification.








Abstract
Hydrogen, a carbon&#8208;free energy carrier is mainly produced through methane steam reforming, generating CO2 as the primary byproduct alongside H2O and CH4, complicating efficient hydrogen purification. Nanofluidic Hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HBF) membranes are promising for gas separation, while methods to precisely tailor pores for enhance performance remain scarce. Herein, a series of HBF membranes (SIFHBF&#8208;Cu, GeFHBF&#8208;Cu and TIFHBF&#8208;Cu) are successfully fabricated for H2 purification. Pore size is precisely tuned at the picometer scale (&lt; 1&#160;&#197;) by altering the anion linkers (SiF62&#8722;, GeF62&#8722; and TiF62&#8722;), enabling efficient H2 purification through the synergy between subtle window adjustments and F&#8208;site&#8208;enhanced CO2 affinity. The SIFHBF&#8208;Cu membrane combines the optimal size&#8208;exclusion and strongest HBF&#8208;CO2 interactions, exhibiting excellent H2/CO2 selectivity (501) and ternary gas separation (H2/CO2: 477, H2/CH4: 557), with stable performance under dry/wet conditions. This study provides a strategy for ultra&#8208;precise pore engineering, showing potential for other challenging separations like seawater desalination and isomer separation.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Metastable LixCoO2 Cathode Enabled by Coherent Intergrowth of T#2 and O2 Phases</title>

By combining multiscale structural characterization techniques, the structure of O2&#8208;type LCO is revealed to comprise a complex configuration in which T#2 and O2 domains coexist coherently in both interlayer and intralayer arrangements. This structural compatibility not only facilitates Li+ transport but also enables the incorporation of a sufficiently high Li content. Compared with O3&#8208;type LCO, the T#2/O2 composite delivers higher reversible capacity and superior rate capability, rather than being restricted to approximately 220 mAh g&#8722;1.








Abstract
O2&#8208;type LixCoO2 (O2&#8208;LCO) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising cathode material with superior electrochemical performance compared to its conventional O3&#8208;type counterpart. Due to its metastable nature, O2&#8208;LCO is typically synthesized via ion exchange under relatively mild thermal conditions; however, the structural evolution and resultant phase composition during this process, which critically affect the material's performance, remain insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically elucidate the interplay between composition, structure, and electrochemical performance in metastable LiCoO2 synthesized via molten&#8208;salt ion exchange. We show that the Na content in the precursor not only dictates the final Li content in the product but also thermodynamically governs the phase transition pathway. Comprehensive long&#8208;range and local structural characterizations reveal the composite nature of ion&#8208;exchanged LCO, comprising T#2, O2, and O3 phases, with their relative fractions determined by the initial Na content. Electrochemical measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, indicate that the optimal phase composite maximizes both Li content and T#2 fraction while suppressing O3 formation, thereby enhancing Li+ diffusion kinetics and structural compatibility. These insights provide a fundamental basis for phase engineering in metastable cathode materials and practical guidelines for designing high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes.

Iron&#8211;NHC catalysis facilitates the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective 1,6&#8208;additions of aliphatic Grignard reagents to &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This rare transformation installs cis&#8208;olefins with enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%, thereby expanding access to chiral building blocks via the formation of remote C&#9472;C bonds.








Abstract
Although conjugate addition to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound is a well&#8208;established method in synthetic organic chemistry, controlling regioselectivity, olefin geometry, and positional isomerism in analogous 1,6&#8208;addition chemistry, which provides a powerful approach for constructing molecular complexity, remains a key challenge. Herein, we report the iron&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective 1,6&#8208;additions of aliphatic Grignard reagents to &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The incorporation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand effectively suppresses undesired &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, thereby enabling the highly cis&#8208;selective installation of the aliphatic group. Remarkably, the use of a rigid tetracyclic chiral NHC ligand afforded the corresponding adducts with enantioselectivities of up to 99%. The developed reaction shows broad substrate scope, accommodating various aliphatic Grignard reagents and unsaturated carbonyl compounds, thereby providing direct access to optically active 1,6&#8208;adducts bearing cis&#8208;configured olefins. Mechanistic investigations, including deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, support the involvement of magnesium enolates and an iron&#8211;NHC catalytic cycle. The developed transformation provides a powerful strategy for the remote functionalization of extended conjugated carbonyl frameworks.

         <title>Atomic Coordination Engineering of Sub&#8208;Nanometer Cu Clusters for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise steering of the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols reaction pathway remains a key challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that coordination engineering of Cu sub&#8208;nanometer clusters enables effectively modulation of bond strengths (Cu&#9472;C, C&#9472;O and Cu&#9472;O) in key intermediates (*CO and *OCHCH2). This strategy successfully diverts the product distribution from ethylene dominance toward C2+ alcohols, achieving a remarkable alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of 7.21.








Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols remains a substantial challenge due to the competing ethylene pathway. Precisely tuning the bond energy of key intermediates plays an essential role in dictating the alcohol and ethylene pathway. Herein, we demonstrate that S and N coordinated Cu sub&#8208;nanometer clusters (Cu/SNC) can achieve targeted modulation of the bond energy (Cu&#9472;C, C&#9472;O, and Cu&#9472;O) of multiple key intermediates (*CO and *OCHCH2), thus leading to preferential production of C2+ alcohols rather than ethylene. Notably, Cu/SNC exhibited a C2+ alcohols selectivity of 59.1% and a high alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of 7.21, which is 19 times larger than that without S and N coordination. Mechanistic studies reveal that N and S dopants individually facilitate CO2 activation and lower the *CO adsorption energy barrier, synergistically steering the asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling pathway to promote C2+ species formation. Moreover, N and S co&#8208;coordination enables precise modulation of the adsorption behavior of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. This electronic restructuring weakens Cu&#9472;O interactions while strengthening the C&#9472;O bond, thereby preferentially stabilizing alcohol&#8208;forming pathways. This work provides a framework for precisely regulating the reaction pathway toward the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ alcohols.

         <title>Divergent Ring&#8208;Opening Functionalization and Reductive Coupling of Pyridines via Zirconium Alkylidene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonreductive cleavage of aromatic carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds in pyridines is achieved via ring&#8208;opening metathesis using PCP&#8208;ligated zirconium (Zr) alkylidene complexes. Ligand control enables divergent outcomes: functionalization into conjugated iminotrienes or reductive homocoupling to bipyridine dianions, revealing new strategies for N&#8208;heterocycle activation.








Abstract
The transformation of N&#8208;heterocycles such as pyridines is of fundamental and practical importance, yet direct cleavage of their aromatic C&#9472;N bonds remains challenging due to strong electronic delocalization and intrinsic stability. Here we report an unprecedented nonreductive cleavage of the aromatic C&#9472;N bond in pyridines via direct ring&#8208;opening metathesis with PCP&#8208;ligated (PCP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;(tBu2PCH2)2&#8208;C6H3) zirconium alkylidene complexes under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that these transformations proceed via highly reactive [Zr]&#9552;C species instead of alkylidyne pathways, forming acyclic Zr&#8208;imido&#8208;triene complexes that undergo imido/oxo exchange with acetone. This enables a concise conversion of pyridines into conjugated iminotrienes that otherwise require multistep syntheses. The ancillary ligand dictates divergent pathways: alkyl&#8208;, alkoxide&#8208;, or aryloxide&#8208;containing alkylidenes selectively promote ring&#8208;opening functionalization, whereas the chloride analogue triggers rare reductive homocoupling of pyridines to bipyridine dianions. This ligand&#8208;controlled reactivity arises from steric and electronic effects of the chloride variant, facilitating C&#9472;H activation and C&#9472;C bond formation. These findings demonstrate a novel approach to aromatic C&#9472;N bond scission and dual functionalization at both termini of the opened pyridine rings, along with a reductive homocoupling pathway to bipyridine dianions, providing new opportunities for catalytic transformations of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles.

The ancillary ligand dictates divergent pathways: alkyl-, alkoxide-, or aryloxide-containing alkylidenes selectively promote ring-opening functionalization, whereas the chloride analogue triggers rare reductive homocoupling of pyridines to bipyridine dianions. This ligand-controlled reactivity arises from steric and electronic effects of the chloride variant, facilitating C&#9472;H activation and C&#9472;C bond formation. These findings demonstrate a novel approach to aromatic C&#9472;N bond scission and dual functionalization at both termini of the opened pyridine rings, along with a reductive homocoupling pathway to bipyridine dianions, providing new opportunities for catalytic transformations of aromatic N-heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Locked Conjugated Backbones in Simple&#8208;Structured Polymer Donors Enabling High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>

Herein, a cost&#8208;effective wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor with dual S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/S&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl noncovalent conformational locks achieves a power conversion efficiency of 16.11% in the binary organic solar cell and over 20% in the ternary system, revolutionizing scalable organic photovoltaic materials through fully locked conformations.








Abstract
The development of wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors with cost&#8208;effectiveness is pivotal for advancing the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these materials often suffer from conformational disorder and distortion, due to the presence of multiple rotatable &#963;&#8208;bonds within their conjugated backbones. This study presents a series of simple&#8208;structured polymer donors PBDT&#8208;TBT&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;H, F, and Cl), and systematically investigates the role of the type and strength of noncovalent conformational locks (NoCLs) in regulating backbone conformations, optoelectronic properties, pre&#8208;aggregation behavior, and charge transport properties. Remarkably, the dual&#8208;locking strategy involving S&#183;&#183;&#183;O and S&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl NoCLs achieves the most highly planar conformation with a fully locked backbone. As a result, the binary OSC device based on PBDT&#8208;TBT&#8208;Cl achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.11%, much higher than its PBDT&#8208;TBT&#8208;H (6.35%) and PBDT&#8208;TBT&#8208;F (12.69%) counterparts. Notably, when utilized as a third component, PBDT&#8208;TBT&#8208;Cl enables a ternary OSC device with a PCE exceeding 20%. This work establishes a clear conformation&#8722;property&#8722;performance relationship, underscoring the critical role of fully locked conformations in designing high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective polymer donors.

         <title>Molecular Templating and Boron&#8208;Doping Guides Twisted Microcrystalline Formation in Coal&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coal&#8208;derived hard carbon anodes for sodium ion batteries typically show sluggish kinetics and low capacity due to the dense microcrystalline stacking. This study employs phenylboronic acid (PhB) as a molecular template and boron (B) source to regulate microcrystalline growth. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and B&#8208;doping induce twisted, defect&#8208;rich domains with expanded interlayer spacing, enabling high capacity and high rate sodium storage.








Abstract
The development of hard carbon (HC) anodes with the low&#8208;cost coal precursor for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) is usually limited by sluggish kinetics and low capacity. The main reason is that the abundant aromatic frameworks in coal produce over&#8208;stacked microcrystalline during high&#8208;temperature carbonization, restricting sodium ion intercalation and diffusion. Here, we propose a molecular templating and doping strategy using phenylboronic acid (PhB) to regulate the microcrystalline structure of coal&#8208;derived HCs. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PhB and coal aromatic suppresses the excessive stacking, while boron (B) doping perturbs charge distribution and introduces intra&#8208;domain defects. These effects lead to the formation of twisted turbostratic domains with an expanded interlayer spacing, enabling high ionic and electronic conductivity for sodium ion storage. The reduced surface electronegativity by B&#8208;doping also favors the formation of a stable anion&#8208;derived interface. As a result, the optimized HC delivers a high reversible capacity of 321 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and maintains a capacity of 249 mAh g&#8722;1 at the high current density of 2.5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates that molecular templating offers an effective route to balance capacity and reaction kinetics in coal&#8208;based HC anodes.

         <title>Intact Mass Profiling Reveals Phospho&#8208;Proteoforms of the Catenins (85&#8211;110&#160;kDa) Regulated by Actomyosin Contractility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study advances top&#8208;down individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS) to profile intact phospho&#8208;proteoforms of &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;catenins (85&#8211;110&#160;kDa) within cadherin&#8211;catenin complexes. By modulating actomyosin contractility, we reveal mechano&#8208;sensitive phosphorylation patterns and propose that distinct catenin proteoforms may reflect adhesive states at cell&#8211;cell junctions. 








Abstract
A central challenge in top&#8208;down proteomics (TDP) is the characterization of large proteoforms (&gt;70&#160;kDa) due to their high spectral complexity in mass spectrometers. Here, we advance individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS) for intact mass and fragmentation analysis of &#946;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;catenins (85&#8211;110&#160;kDa), key components of adherens junctions. Using denatured I2MS, we resolved discrete phosphorylation states of catenins isolated from HEK cells subjected to differential actomyosin tension. Up to 10 phosphorylations were detected on &#946;&#8208;catenin (&#946;&#8208;cat) and 7 on &#945;&#8208;catenin (&#945;&#8208;cat), with site&#8208;specific changes corresponding to actomyosin contractility. Notably, phosphorylation at &#945;&#8208;cat S641 was constitutive, while other sites in the P&#8208;linker and actin&#8208;binding domains, as well as &#946;&#8208;cat S675 and S552, were sensitive to actomyosin perturbation. Application of I2MS for fragment ion detection (I2MS2) also enabled 25%&#8211;30% sequence coverage for these exceptionally large proteoforms, compared to &lt;1% using conventional methods for top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS). Our results are consistent with a &#8220;catenin phospho&#8209;code&#8221; model, wherein combinatorial phosphorylation patterns reflect and potentially modulate the mechanotransductive environment at cell&#8211;cell adhesions. This work establishes top&#8208;down I2MS as a viable approach for probing complex post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) landscapes in high&#8208;mass proteins and highlights proteoforms as functional units in cellular regulation.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Chlorocyclopropene&#8208;Tethered Diazocarbonyl Compounds and Their Cyclization to Form Poly&#8208;Substituted Phenols</title>

A TiCl4&#8208;mediated dual C&#9472;F bond functionalization of&#160;gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes has been developed, which enables regioselective synthesis of diverse chlorocyclopropene&#8208;tethered diazocarbonyl compounds. The resultant products were converted to poly&#8208;substituted phenols through a novel Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization.








Abstract
Herein, we disclose a dual C&#9472;F bond functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes using a catalytic amount of TiCl4. The reaction proceeds through a sequential nucleophilic addition of chloride and silyl diazoenolates to the nonsymmetric cyclopropenium cations generated by the fluoride abstraction. The preferential monofluorocyclopropenium&#8208;titanate(IV) salts enable an efficient halogen transfer within the ion pairs, thus providing the opportunity to accept the addition of another type of nucleophiles. A stable [(PhC3HCl)+]2[Ti4Cl12F6]2&#8722; salt was isolated, and its structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. The chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of two different nucleophiles gives vicinal substitution products regardless of the electronic properties of substituents on the gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes and the sizes of nucleophiles. Various 2&#8208;chlorocyclopropene&#8208;tethered diazocarbonyl compounds were prepared with the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups. The synthetic utility of the resultant products was demonstrated by the discovery of a new poly&#8208;substituted phenol synthesis via a Rh(II)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we disclose a dual C&#9472;F bond functionalization of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorocyclopropenes using a catalytic amount of TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction proceeds through a sequential nucleophilic addition of chloride and silyl diazoenolates to the nonsymmetric cyclopropenium cations generated by the fluoride abstraction. The preferential monofluorocyclopropenium-titanate(IV) salts enable an efficient halogen transfer within the ion pairs, thus providing the opportunity to accept the addition of another type of nucleophiles. A stable [(PhC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HCl)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Ti&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salt was isolated, and its structure was confirmed by X-ray crystal diffraction. The chemo- and regioselective addition of two different nucleophiles gives vicinal substitution products regardless of the electronic properties of substituents on the &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorocyclopropenes and the sizes of nucleophiles. Various 2-chlorocyclopropene-tethered diazocarbonyl compounds were prepared with the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups. The synthetic utility of the resultant products was demonstrated by the discovery of a new poly-substituted phenol synthesis via a Rh(II)-catalyzed cyclization reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses at Single&#8208;Nucleotide Resolution with an Autocatalytic Rolling Circle Amplification System</title>

         <dc:description>
An autocatalytic rolling circle amplification (A&#8208;RCA) system has been developed to facilitate the rapid and accurate detection of multiplexed respiratory viruses. By incorporating a lateral&#8208;flow assay (LFA) technique, the A&#8208;RCA offers a portable diagnostic platform suitable for unsupervised self&#8208;testing of viral RNAs with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.








Abstract
Amid the continuing epidemic of respiratory viruses (RVs), clinical diagnostics need scalable technologies that enable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogenic viruses with high accuracy and specificity. Here, we propose an autocatalytic rolling circle amplification (A&#8208;RCA) system for the precise identification of RV genomic markers through sequence&#8208;specific target recognition and synergistic catalytic signal amplification. The system, which we incorporated into lateral&#8208;flow strip tests, exploits the cross&#8208;stimulation between deoxyribonuclease (DNAzyme) self&#8208;cleavage reaction and rolling circle amplification (RCA) to exponentially amplify the recognition of virus RNA sequences for the visually perceptible signal transduction. With superior amplification efficiency, this innovative autocatalysis&#8208;driven artificial reaction system facilitates the rapid and robust detection of various viral RNAs, including those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), influenza A, and influenza B, with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution, offering a portable diagnostic platform for unsupervised self&#8208;examination of different RVs and their mutants. This modular A&#8208;RCA system is adaptable for multiplexed viral RNA profiling in clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and implemented on lateral&#8208;flow strip assays for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnostics. The accessibility and programmability of the A&#8208;RCA system make it a promising candidate for epidemiological surveillance in resource&#8208;limited settings, facilitating the prompt response to emerging RVs and the prevention of viral pandemics.

         <title>Structure Model&#8208;Guided Reprogramming Enables Functional Interconversion of Phomactatriene and Verticillene Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phomactatriene synthase (SiPS) and two verticillene synthases (LxVS and AxVS) from bacteria were identified through genome mining. DFT calculations show that phomactatriene and verticillene compounds share a common rearrangement pathway. Comparative analyses of the synthase structural models, together with molecular modelling and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, enabled their functional interconversion.








Abstract
Terpenoids represent the most structurally diverse class of natural products on Earth. Terpene synthases are key enzymes for constructing the complex and varied terpene skeletons by catalyzing the formation of multiple carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Phomactatriene and verticillene family natural products are both classified as bicyclic diterpenoids, sharing a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane skeleton. In this study, we used genome mining to identify the phomactatriene synthase SiPS from bacteria, together with two verticillene synthases, LxVS and AxVS. Our DFT calculations revealed that the rearrangement pathways for compounds in the phomactatriene and verticillene families follow a shared biosynthetic route. Furthermore, through comparative structural model analyses of the phomactatriene and verticillene synthases, we employed molecular modelling and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to facilitate functional interconversion between these distinct terpene synthases. This work enhances our understanding of terpene biosynthesis and the potential for engineering terpene synthases for biotechnological applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Peptide and Protein Functionalization with Cyclopropenium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective bioconjugation using aromatic cyclopropenium cations is reported. The reaction proceeds rapidly under aqueous conditions, enabling site&#8208;selective installation of tetrasubstituted cyclopropene rings on peptides and proteins. The method shows preference for internal cysteines and provides conjugates that serve as efficient radical traps in thiol&#8211;ene chemistry, forming stable cyclopropane&#8208;linked products.








Abstract
In the realm of organic chemistry, carbocations play a pivotal role as highly reactive intermediates in the synthesis of complex molecules. While cyclase enzymes construct terpenoid natural products through carbocation intermediates, the use of these electrophilic reactive species for peptide and protein bioconjugation in aqueous media remains unexplored. Herein, we disclose the discovery and development of a new chemical modification of peptides and proteins with aromatic cyclopropenium cations, selective at cysteine residues. The bioconjugation is fast, operationally simple, and occurs at low concentration in aqueous media, allowing for the installation of a tetrasubstituted cyclopropene ring with excellent site selectivity. Moreover, the cyclopropenylation is preferential to internal cysteines, thus complementing current methodologies for selective terminal cysteine bioconjugation. These studies further showcased the bioconjugates' utility as radical traps in a thiol&#8211;ene process, enabling the formation of cyclopropane&#8208;linked conjugates.

         <title>Colloidal Phase Control in Plasmonic Metal Oxide Nanocrystals via Competitive Metal&#8211;Ligand Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieve programmable gelation temperature and network structure in terpyridine&#8208;functionalized tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystals. This strategy leverages the tuning of competitive metal&#8211;terpyridine and metal&#8211;halide equilibria via metal and halide identity, concentration, and temperature, enabling broad&#8208;range infrared optical modulation.








Abstract
Colloidal nanocrystal gels offer tunable optical properties governed by both the nature of the building blocks and their spatial arrangement. When assembled via reversible molecular linkers, their phase behavior and structure are primarily dictated by bond strength and lability. However, precise control over these interactions remains a significant synthetic challenge and is often system&#8208;specific. Here, we present a simple, broadly tunable linking strategy that modulates nanocrystal phase behavior and assembly structure by leveraging competitive metal&#8211;ligand equilibria. We achieve programmable control over gelation temperature and network structure by tuning competitive metal&#8211;terpyridine and metal&#8211;halide equilibria in terpyridine&#8208;functionalized tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals, governed by metal and halide identity, concentration, and temperature, enabling wide&#8208;range infrared optical modulation. Combined kinetic Monte Carlo and optical simulations reveal that weaker, more labile links facilitate particle crawling, leading to denser gel structures with enhanced plasmon coupling. This strategy eliminates the need for complex ligand or linker design and establishes competitive coordination chemistry as a versatile platform for engineering dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive colloidal&#160;assemblies.

We construct a synergistic binding environment in a novel metal&#8208;organic framework (ZU&#8208;925) that is tailored through an isoreticular chemistry strategy, addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of one&#8208;step removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethane (C2H6) impurities in ethylene purification. Ultra&#8208;high purity (99.99%) ethylene could be directly produced with the production of 17.8&#160;L kg&#8722;1 by a single adsorption and desorption process. 








Abstract
Precise control over pore environments in porous materials remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for efficient ethylene (C2H4) purification via physisorption, particularly when targeting impurities with distinct physicochemical properties such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethane (C2H6). In this study, we report an isoreticular design strategy to fine&#8208;tune the local pore chemistry of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), enabling the simultaneous selective adsorption of CO2 and C2H6. Through rational organic ligand engineering, the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized analogue PCP&#8208;TPA&#8208;2OH (also termed as ZU&#8208;925, ZU represents Zhejiang University) breaks the bottleneck of only C2H6 capture exhibited by the parent PCP&#8208;TPA. The tailored synergistic binding environment of ZU&#8208;925 makes it be new benchmark in one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from CO2/C2H6/C2H4 ternary mixtures. Ultra&#8208;purity C2H4 (99.99%) along with high productivity of 17.8&#160;L kg&#8722;1 could be realized through only one&#8208;step adsorption. Molecular simulations reveal that the preferential binding of C2H6 arises from a tailored pore environment featuring aligned aromatic units and electronegative oxygen atoms, while Lewis basic hydroxyl groups locally modulate the pore chemistry, contributing to enhanced CO2 capture. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced adsorbents for multiple impurity removal via isoreticular chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Water Bonding on Clusters Enables Ultrafast Humidity Response and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ultrafast cluster&#8208;based humidity sensor is demonstrated with PhQPCu3I3 featuring a semi&#8208;exposed Cu3I3 crown, which can simultaneously establish rapid water adsorption and desorption through dynamic synergistic bonding of H&#9472;I and HO&#9472;I, leading to ultrashort response and recovery time of 0.54 and 0.45 s comparable to human reaction time (0.5 s) and competent for real&#8208;time human&#8208;body related (HBR) humidity monitoring. 








Abstract
Fast response and recovery are crucial for real&#8208;time human&#8208;body related (HBR) humidity monitoring, which faces a formidable challenge, due to the opposite requirements on interaction intensities of sensing materials with water. Herein, we demonstrate the first cluster&#8208;based humidity sensor with PhQPCu3I3 featuring a semi&#8208;exposed Cu3I3 crown. Compared to ligand encapsulated Cu4I4 clusters, low coordination, short distance and same orientation of iodine atoms in PhQPCu3I3 lead to a rapid and reversible &#8220;H2O&#160;+&#160;I&#8230;I&#8221; reaction. Consequently, besides more than doubled sensitivity of 106 and halved hysteresis error of 3.2% in related humidity range of 11%&#8211;97%, PhQPCu3I3 endows its devices with ultrashort response and recovery time of 0.54 and 0.45 s comparable to human reaction time (0.5 s). Owing to its record&#8208;low comprehensive reaction time within 1.0 s, PhQPCu3I3 based sensors were used for real&#8208;time respiratory rate monitoring and non&#8208;contact information input. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of &#8220;dynamic synergistic bonding&#8221; in combining rapid water adsorption and desorption and superiority of cluster sensors in real&#8208;time HBR applications.

         <title>Suppression of Excimer Formation via Conjugation&#8208;Driven Interactions in Crosslinked Hole Transport Layer for Efficient Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugate&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven strategy employing asymmetric/branched molecules is proposed to inhibit parallel stacking of CBP&#8208;V, thereby suppressing excimer formation within HTL and achieving a tenfold enhancement in mobility, further enabling target blue QLEDs to achieve a max EQE of 24.12%.








Abstract
Blue quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), underperforming relative to red and green counterparts, shoulder the critical responsibility for full&#8208;color displays. Crosslinked 9,9&#8242;&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;ethenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole) (CBP&#8208;V), owning a deep HOMO level (&#8764;&#8722;5.9&#160;eV), is a promising hole transport layer (HTL) candidate for blue QLEDs. However, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and molecular rotatability in CBP&#8208;V promote parallel stacking and electron cloud overlap. This gives rise to excimer formation, which exacerbates the energy&#8208;level disorder in crosslinked CBP&#8208;V and thus degrades its hole mobility. Herein, 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)pyridine (26DCzPPy) and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine (TCTA), featuring analogous phenylcarbazole structural fragments, are incorporated into CBP&#8208;V to suppress excimer formation via a conjugate&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven strategy. The asymmetric configuration of 26DCzPPy and the branched architecture of TCTA enable modulation of molecular stacking behavior and suppress parallel stacking of CBP&#8208;V during the crosslinking process. This realizes spatial segregation of CBP&#8208;V and thus eliminates the prerequisite for excimer formation. Resultantly, suppression of excimer allows HTL to achieve a tenfold enhancement of hole mobility from 5.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 to 5.97&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#183;V&#8722;1&#183;s&#8722;1. Target QLEDs gain prominent enhancements in external quantum efficiencies for deep&#8208;blue emission (456&#160;nm) from 11.48% to 22.92% and pure&#8208;blue emission (470&#160;nm) from 13.39% to 24.12%, with maximum brightness values of 29735 and 91268&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Dual Sacrificial Strategy Toward Tough and Recyclable CO2&#8208;Sourced Epoxy Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a CO2&#8208;derived epoxy thermoset designed through a dual sacrificial strategy. The material architecture combines flexible segments for energy dissipation with cleavable linkages for recyclability, while preserving rigidity through cross&#8208;linked networks. The resulting material successfully reconciles traditionally conflicting properties&#8208;toughness, rigidity, and recyclability&#8208;establishing a new paradigm for sustainable high&#8208;performance thermosets.








Abstract
Developing thermosetting epoxy resins that concurrently deliver high performance (integrating superior strength with toughness) and chemical recyclability presents a persistent challenge in sustainable polymer advancement. Herein, we present a dual sacrificial strategy employing CO2&#8208;derived poly(ether&#8208;carbonate) (PPC) polyols as functional epoxy hardeners. Flexible ether segments serve as sacrificial components enhancing toughness, while cleavable carbonate groups function as sacrificial sites facilitating degradation. This dual sacrificial design in PPC polyols demonstrably enhances mechanical properties while enabling degradability. Model reactions and curing kinetics analyses reveal a distinctive dual&#8208;stage crosslinking process governed by hydroxyl transfer mechanisms. The resulting hierarchical cure yields thermosets with unconventional hyperbranched topologies embedded within uniform network structures, conferring: 1) tunable thermomechanical properties (Tg&#160;=&#160;53&#8211;129 &#176;C) through precise polyol content control; 2) substantially elevated toughness (up to 5.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), exceeding conventional epoxy resins by&#160;&gt;300%; and 3) rapid catalytic chemical recyclability (&lt;4&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C), with degradation products functioning as reusable hardeners. Practical validation via glass fiber&#8208;reinforced composites and electronic packaging confirms robust performance with full recyclability. This integrated methodology reconciles the historical trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and chemical recyclability in thermosets, establishing a viable pathway toward sustainable epoxy production.

&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;53&#8211;129 &#176;C) through precise polyol content control; 2) substantially elevated toughness (up to 5.2&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), exceeding conventional epoxy resins by&#160;&amp;gt;300%; and 3) rapid catalytic chemical recyclability (&amp;lt;4&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C), with degradation products functioning as reusable hardeners. Practical validation via glass fiber-reinforced composites and electronic packaging confirms robust performance with full recyclability. This integrated methodology reconciles the historical trade-off between mechanical robustness and chemical recyclability in thermosets, establishing a viable pathway toward sustainable epoxy production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Assisted Copper/Chiral Diamine&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation for the Kinetic Dearomative Spirocyclization of Arenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;assisted copper/chiral diamine&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation has been developed for the kinetic dearomative spirocyclization of arenols, producing axially chiral biaryls and chiral oxa&#8208;spirocycle simultaneously with good enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope. This stepwise 1e&#8208;oxidation approach proceeds via the key radical&#8208;cation intermediate. The anion effects were discovered experimentally, and further disclosed by DFT calculations.








Abstract
The utilization of arenols was realized via the catalytic asymmetric dearomatization (CADA) to deliver a broad range of valuable chiral compounds. In this field, CADA of arenols, especially 2&#8208;naphthols with diversified external electrophiles has been well established, however the oxidative CADA of 2&#8208;naphthols with an external nucleophile, proceeding via an initial SET&#8208;oxidation to reverse its polarity, is rare. Herein, we report our recent development on the copper/chiral diamine&#8208;catalyzed kinetic spirocyclization of 2&#8208;naphthols under ambient conditions, in which the axial and spiro&#8208;central elements of chirality could be simultaneously achieved in a one&#8208;step kinetic resolution process. The robust nature of the oxidative CADA strategy is reflected by a broad scope of 2&#8208;naphthol substrates with good control of the enantioselectivity. DFT calculations suggested that the anion of chloride played a crucial role in the control of enantioselectivity by forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group in the substrate and the diamine ligand. The matched coordination of naphthol substrates with chiral copper(II) catalyst leads to the subsequent oxidation to access the latter stereospecific spirocyclization.

         <title>Photoresponsive Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Crosslinked Hydrogels: From Synthesis to Diverse Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated persistent luminescent nanoparticles were incorporated into the hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;crosslinked dual&#8208;network leading to a hybrid hydrogel that acts as flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screen with light&#8208;controlled self&#8208;fitting properties on non&#8208;planar substrates and clear image results that precisely reflect the real defects.








Abstract
The development of light&#8208;sensitive hydrogels with rapid and on&#8208;demand responses stands represents an important outstanding challenge for developing flexible devices. Here, a light&#8208;sensitive divinyl monomer, bis(2&#8208;methacrylamidoethyl) 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2&#8242;H&#8208;[1,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl)dibenzoate (HABI&#8208;diMAm), was synthesized and further copolymerized with N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide (N&#8208;MA), leading to the formation of a photoresponsive single network hydrogel (G1) that undergoes a reversibly dynamic transformation from gel to sol upon 405&#160;nm light irradiation, enabling a flexible non&#8208;contact dynamic information display system. With the introduction of an additional permanent covalent crosslinker, a dual&#8208;crosslinked single network hydrogel (G2) was developed as a flexible actuator that responds to light&#8208;irradiation within seconds. Next, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated persistent luminescent nanoparticles (X&#8208;PLNPs) were incorporated into the dual&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;network network hydrogel, leading to hybrid hydrogel (G3) that acted as a flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screen with light&#8208;controlled self&#8208;fitting properties on non&#8208;planar substrates. The X&#8208;ray imaging results demonstrated successful recording of clear images that precisely reflect the real defects in the targeted non&#8208;planar object. Hence, the introduced HABI&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels have broad potential as photoresponsive hydrogels.

Biomimetic construction of hydrophobic&#8208;polar microenvironments within robust metal&#8208;organic frameworks for record&#8208;breaking noble gases separation and capture. 








Abstract
The separation and capture of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) pose critical industrial and environmental challenges. We report two isostructural MOFs (NKMOF&#8208;8&#8208;Br and NKMOF&#8208;8&#8208;Me) with ultra&#8208;micropores (&#8764;6&#160;&#197;) integrating bromine/methyl and cyano groups, creating biomimetic hydrophobic&#8208;polar microenvironments for efficient Xe/Kr separation and nuclear off&#8208;gas capture. These MOFs exhibit record low&#8208;pressure Xe uptake and Xe packing density. Breakthrough tests under two industrial scenarios&#8212;air&#8208;separation byproduct purification and trace gas capture&#8212;demonstrate unprecedented Kr productivity (12.26&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1) and Xe/Kr capture capacity (Xe: 32.13&#160;mmol&#160;kg&#8722;1; Kr: 9.35&#160;mmol&#160;kg&#8722;1), with retained performance after 500&#160;kGy &#946;&#8208;irradiation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms gas molecules preferentially occupying channel centers, stabilized by hydrophobic van der Waals interactions and cyano polarization effects, while theoretical simulations establish a clear structure&#8208;property relationship. These results highlight NKMOF&#8208;8&#8208;Br and NKMOF&#8208;8&#8208;Me as leading candidates for energy&#8208;efficient noble gas separation and nuclear waste management, and demonstrate a generalizable strategy for engineering adsorption through hydrophobic&#8208;polar synergy.

         <title>Record&#8208;Breaking Discharge Capacity and Rate Capability in Li&#9472;O2 Batteries Through Magnetic Field&#8208;Induced Short&#8208;Range Order Li2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic field dynamically modulates the domain distribution within the discharge products of Li2O2, creating a variable energy field that facilitates a unique three&#8208;phase structure. This system achieved&#8208; a record discharge capacity of 115&#160;918 mAh g&#8722;1, nearly three times higher than existing high&#8208;performance systems, with&#160;high rate performance at 6.7 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle life over 350 cycles.








Abstract
Aprotic Li&#9472;O2 batteries face significant challenges due to the insulating and insoluble nature of Li2O2, which hinders the redox kinetics and severely limits the overall performance. Traditional methods, such as using solid or liquid catalysts to enhance the kinetics, encounter substantial obstacles, in which solid catalysts are limited by their interface with Li2O2, while liquid catalysts may lead to shuttle corrosion of the Li anode, would diminish catalytic effectiveness. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address these issues by incorporating magnetic dopants into the discharge products and applying an external magnetic field. This approach results in magnetically assisted Li&#9472;O2 batteries with significantly improved redox kinetics. During discharge, the magnetic field dynamically aligns Co2+ centers within the discharge product, forming a short&#8208;range ordered magnetic structure with alternating paramagnetic and diamagnetic domains, which enhances the formation kinetics of the discharge product. During charging, these uniformly distributed Co active centers act autocatalytically, accelerating the product decomposition kinetics. This configuration achieves a record&#8208;breaking discharge capacity of 115&#160;918 mAh g&#8722;1 and an exceptional rate capability of 6.7 A g&#8722;1. Our results demonstrate that controlling the electronic and ionic transport properties of alkali peroxides can fundamentally enhance cathode reaction kinetics, providing new design principles for high&#8208;performance Li&#9472;O2 batteries.

         <title>Solvent Chain Length Directed Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative, we reveal the previously overlooked role of solvent chain length in controlling supramolecular polymorphism. Short alkanes favor face&#8208;to&#8208;face H&#8208;type stacking into one&#8208;dimensional fibers, whereas the larger volume occupancy of long alkanes promotes slipped stacking and self&#8208;limiting growth into discrete aggregates, with intermediate alkanes yielding concomitant supramolecular polymorphs.








Abstract
Although solvents are central to self&#8208;assembly, their chain length has not been recognized as a factor controlling supramolecular polymerization. Herein, we introduce solvent chain length as a key parameter dictating the outcome of supramolecular polymerization. We investigated this phenomenon using a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative bearing a phenyl group at the meso&#8208;position, amide groups, and solubilizing dodecyloxy side chains (1). Remarkably, while the shortest liquid alkanes, n&#8208;pentane and n&#8208;hexane, promote face&#8208;to&#8208;face (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions leading to one&#8208;dimensional fiber&#8208;like morphologies (AggB), the longest liquid linear alkane, n&#8208;hexadecane, induces a molecular rearrangement into slipped stacks that cannot efficiently grow into extended one&#8208;dimensional assemblies, resulting in discrete morphologies (AggA). In alkanes of intermediate length (C7&#8211;C15), both assembled states coexist to varying degrees, leading to concomitant supramolecular polymorphs, with the slipped packing becoming progressively favored as the chain length increases. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that AggA is favored in longer&#8208;chain solvents owing to enhanced solvent interactions and conformational freedom of the side chains, while the proximity of aliphatic groups to the aromatic cores attenuates stack elongation. Our findings broaden the role of solvents as design elements in self&#8208;assembly and offer new insights into the development of functional supramolecular polymorphs.

         <title>Tuning Asymmetric Isomers in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks to Enhance Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the electronic state of metal&#8208;free COF catalysts through asymmetric geometric isomers, the 2&#8208;substituted asymmetric thiophene COF&#8208;&#945; better optimizes local electron distribution, promotes the formation of OOH* intermediates in oxygen reduction reactions, and thus improves the selectivity of the 2e&#8722; electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
Embedding isomers into crystalline skeletons with well&#8208;defined spatial structures represents a feasible way to improve the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, most research has been focused on the design of symmetric molecules, while studying asymmetric effects based on isomeric systems remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduced isomeric thiophene to regulate the ORR of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and further adjusted the molecular geometry configuration through asymmetric design, obtaining isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substituents and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substituents. The intermediate adsorption ability and electronic states are precisely adjusted through asymmetric isomers, resulting in controllable chemical activity and excellent catalytic performance. Notably, the introduction of asymmetric thiophene units with 2&#8208;substituents into a pure carbon&#8208;based model provides a more favorable pathway for the hydrogen peroxide production process, resulting in a remarkable productivity of 11.20&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with a Faradaic efficiency of 90.16%. Moreover, theoretical calculations and in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR experiments show that asymmetric thiophene skeletons can induce the activation of adjacent phenyl units, and precisely identify the benzene ring carbon atom (site&#8208;8) connected to the thiophene unit as a potential active site. This study offers an approach to designing efficient electrocatalysts by adjusting asymmetric geometric isomers.

         <title>Unlocking the Critical Role of Noncovalent Interactions Between Alkali Metal Cations and Nitrate in Promoting the Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>

Alkali cations&#8217; effect on Cu&#8208;catalyzed NO3&#8722;RR shows activity trend: Li+&#160;&lt; Cs+&#160;&lt;&#160;Na+&#160;&lt;&#160;K+. AIMD simulations reveal Na+/K+/Cs+ with soft solvation shells enhance NO3&#8722; &#8594; NO2&#8722; RDS via partial desolvation and electrostatic coordination, with K+ exhibiting optimal interaction strength.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is widely investigated for sustainable ammonia (NH3) production from NO3&#8722; pollutants. Alkali metal cations (AM+) in the electrolyte often greatly impact electrocatalytic performance; however, the role of AM+ in the NO3&#8722;RR remains unclear. Here, we first investigate the influence of AM+ on the Cu&#8208;catalyzed NO3&#8722;RR, revealing an activity increase trend of Li+&#160;&lt;&#160;Cs+&#160;&lt;&#160;Na+&#160;&lt;&#160;K+, which is inconsistent with the local electric field and proton transfer rate increase trend of Li+&#160;&lt;&#160;Na+&#160;&lt;&#160;K+&#160;&lt; Cs+, hinting that the presence of other important factors governs the NO3&#8722;RR activity. Intriguingly, Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations uncover that Na+, K+, and Cs+ with relatively soft solvation shells could be partially desolvated and then coordinate with NO3&#8722; via a short&#8208;range electrostatic interaction, thereby boosting the rate determining step (RDS), that is the conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;. Notably, K+ with suitable NO3&#8722; interaction strength has higher ability to boost the RDS than Na+ and Cs+ with too weak and strong strength, respectively. Our results highlight that the short&#8208;range electrostatic interaction strength of AM+/NO3&#8722; is a crucial factor to determine the NO3&#8722;RR activity.

         <title>Cationic&#8208;Catalyst Strategy Enabling Ultrafast and Controlled Polymerization and Efficient Depolymerization Toward a Circular Polymer Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a highly efficient cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy for ultrafast and controlled synthesis of amino acid (AA) polymers, as well as efficient depolymerization towards a circular polymer economy. The cationic catalyst facilitates efficient depolymerization of AA polymers into environmentally friendly amino acids under mild condition, with the catalyst itself being recyclable, achieving a dual closed&#8208;loop recycling system for AA polymers and cationic catalyst. 








Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers is considered one of the ideal solutions to alleviate the growing polymer waste. Fast, controlled synthesis and closed&#8208;loop recycling of amino acid (AA) polymers, as an important class of polyamides, are highly important for applications and circular polymer economy. Strong base&#8208;initiated N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) polymerization can prepare AA polymers very quickly, however, has the long&#8208;standing challenge of poor molecular weight controllability and numerous side reactions. Herein, we develop a highly efficient cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy that enables both &#8220;ultrafast, controlled AA polymer synthesis&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8208;loop AA polymer recycling&#8221;. This robust and easily scalable cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy is compatible with various organic strong bases as initiators, and enables the synthesis of molecular weight well&#8208;controlled AA polymers on a hectogram scale (&#8764;120&#160;g) within minutes. Moreover, the cationic catalyst facilitates the efficient depolymerization of AA polymers into environmentally friendly amino acids, with a recovery rate of 85.9%. In addition, the catalyst itself can be recycled quantitatively. In short, the highly efficient cationic&#8208;catalyst strategy implies practical and promising applications in polymerization and depolymerization chemistry, demonstrating great potential for the circular polymer economy and sustainable management of polymer waste.

     alt="Cationic-Catalyst Strategy Enabling Ultrafast and Controlled Polymerization and Efficient Depolymerization Toward a Circular Polymer Economy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a highly efficient cationic-catalyst strategy for ultrafast and controlled synthesis of amino acid (AA) polymers, as well as efficient depolymerization towards a circular polymer economy. The cationic catalyst facilitates efficient depolymerization of AA polymers into environmentally friendly amino acids under mild condition, with the catalyst itself being recyclable, achieving a dual closed-loop recycling system for AA polymers and cationic catalyst. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of chemically recyclable polymers is considered one of the ideal solutions to alleviate the growing polymer waste. Fast, controlled synthesis and closed-loop recycling of amino acid (AA) polymers, as an important class of polyamides, are highly important for applications and circular polymer economy. Strong base-initiated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) polymerization can prepare AA polymers very quickly, however, has the long-standing challenge of poor molecular weight controllability and numerous side reactions. Herein, we develop a highly efficient cationic-catalyst strategy that enables both &#8220;ultrafast, controlled AA polymer synthesis&#8221; and &#8220;closed-loop AA polymer recycling&#8221;. This robust and easily scalable cationic-catalyst strategy is compatible with various organic strong bases as initiators, and enables the synthesis of molecular weight well-controlled AA polymers on a hectogram scale (&#8764;120&#160;g) within minutes. Moreover, the cationic catalyst facilitates the efficient depolymerization of AA polymers into environmentally friendly amino acids, with a recovery rate of 85.9%. In addition, the catalyst itself can be recycled quantitatively. In short, the highly efficient cationic-catalyst strategy implies practical and promising applications in polymerization and depolymerization chemistry, demonstrating great potential for the circular polymer economy and sustainable management of polymer waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linker Enantiomericity Engineering in Reticular Frameworks for Architecting Robust Materials with Synergetic Open Metal Sites for Efficient SF6 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsically chiral topology concept and Wallach's rule were leveraged to guide the rational synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework materials with distinct net dimensions and structures. The resulting 3D MOFs obtained exclusively when using enantiopure linkers shows an open structure decorated with exposed open Cu2+ sites that work synergistically to promote the efficient capture of SF6 and SF6/N2 separation.








Abstract
Chiral linkers offer built&#8208;in enantiomericity capable of regulating pore microenvironments or even net dimensions and topologies of the resulting reticular frameworks. Whereas it has been established that enantiopure and racemic linkers can form significantly different structures upon metal directed coordination assembly, such examples are still extremely rare and occur largely through serendipity rather than rational design. In this work, guided by the intrinsically chiral topology concept established in reticular frameworks and the Wallach's rule that racemic crystals are denser than chiral ones in supramolecular systems, we target a unique example where enantiopure linker gives a homochiral 3D porous and robust framework (S&#8208;TAMOF&#8208;3D) with intrinsically chiral (10,3)&#8208;a srs topology while the racemic linker exclusively produces a 2D dense and non&#8208;porous layered structure (race&#8208;TAMOF&#8208;2D), upon crystallization with Cu ions in water at room temperature. This experimental observation points to the fact that linker enantiomericity could lead to structural diversity much greater than has hitherto been suspected. Moreover, the activated S&#8208;TAMOF&#8208;3D shows triangle&#8208;shaped cavities decorated with exposed open Cu2+ sites, which work synergistically to bind SF6 molecules with outstanding SF6/N2 separation performance, as validated by extensive sorption and breakthrough experiments as well as theoretical simulations. Our work suggests that beyond molecular systems, Wallach's rule can also be leveraged to guide the design of extended reticular materials that otherwise are unachievable via traditional linker engineering strategies, thus offering a new methodology for architecting reticular materials with enhanced functions.

         <title>C&#9472;H Silylation of Unactivated Arenes Catalyzed by a Borenium/Pyridine Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis pair, composed of a highly Lewis acidic borenium ion and a weak pyridine base, can catalyze C&#9472;H silylation of benzene and other unactivated arenes with H2SiArF2 (ArF&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl) as the silylation reagent. This system can also be applied for direct C&#9472;H silylation of polystyrene. A key pyridine&#8208;coordinated silylium intermediate was isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H silylation of arenes provides a straightforward and sustainable method for the functionalization of arenes. However, to date, it has been limited to electron&#8208;rich arenes. Here we report a Lewis pair, composed of a highly Lewis acidic borenium ion and a weak pyridine base, can catalyze C&#9472;H silylation of benzene and other unactivated arenes with H2SiArF2 (ArF&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenyl) as silylation reagent under neat conditions. Unlike most of its noble metal counterparts, this metal&#8208;free system does not require stoichiometric sacrificial hydrogen acceptors. Additionally, this system can be applied for direct C&#9472;H silylation of polystyrene, opening a new avenue for the functionalization of polystyrene. Our mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of H2SiArF2 by the Lewis pair leads to the formation of a pyridine&#8208;coordinated silylium intermediate, which was isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the C&#9472;H activation mediated by this silylium intermediate is likely the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Photochromic Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 Perovskite Nanosheets as a Novel Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our synthesized NO3&#8208;&#8208;doped Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 perovskite nanosheets exhibit good stability and reversible light&#8208;induced phase separation to CsPb2Br5, accompanied by a tunable photoluminescence transition from 588&#160;nm (orange) to 521&#160;nm (green). This transformation enables the design of a UV&#8208;power&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.








Abstract
Although the photoinduced segregation phenomenon of mixed halide perovskites has application potential in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage, the easy oxidation of I&#8208; into highly volatile I2 leads to a serious deficiency in material stability. In this study, we addressed this issue by substituting the instable anion of I&#8208; with the stable anion of NO3&#8208; and synthesizing a novel photochromic 2D perovskite of Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 nanosheets (PNSs). The synthesized functional material exhibited significantly enhanced stability, maintaining stable luminescence under ambient conditions for over a year, far surpassing traditional mixed halide perovskites. Further research revealed that reversible photoluminescence switching between orange and green in Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 PNSs suspension could be achieved by regulating the UV light power of irradiation and solution concentration, demonstrating the photoinduced segregation phenomenon in non&#8208;halide/halide hybrid perovskites. The photoinduced segregation could be effectively suppressed by doping with Cl&#8208; ions. Based on this photochromic property, we designed a novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting label by exploiting the distinct UV&#8208;response characteristics of Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2 and Cs2Pb(NO3)2Br2&#8208;xClx, offering a new design strategy for stimulus&#8208;responsive perovskite materials.

         <title>Tailoring Spin&#8211;Spin Dipolar Interactions by Conformational Locking Toward Room&#8208;Temperature Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a conformational locking strategy to precisely engineer spin&#8208;spin dipolar interactions (SSDI) in Chichibabin's hydrocarbons (CHs). By controlling the dihedral angle (&#952;), we create stable, high&#8208;spin diradicals, with one candidate, CH(2), exhibiting exceptional spin coherence at room temperature, showcasing its potential as a molecular qubit.








Abstract
Chichibabin's hydrocarbons (CHs) typically exhibit resonance equilibrium between closed&#8208;shell quinoidal and open&#8208;shell diradical configurations due to the flexible rotation of the molecule structure. We herein report a series of conformationally rigidified CHs achieved through lockage of chiral binaphthalene frameworks. Systematic enhancement of open&#8208;shell character was observed with increasing dihedral angles between naphthalene moieties, as evidenced by electronic spectroscopy and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. This conformational locking strategy enables precise engineering of spin&#8211;spin dipolar interactions, unambiguously revealed by zero&#8208;field splitting parameters derived from EPR studies. Specifically, CH(2) exhibits excellent ambient stability and exceptional spin coherence at room temperature, with attractive spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (T1) of 1207&#160;ns and spin dephasing time (Tm) of 205&#160;ns.

     alt="Tailoring Spin&#8211;Spin Dipolar Interactions by Conformational Locking Toward Room-Temperature Molecular Qubits"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a conformational locking strategy to precisely engineer spin-spin dipolar interactions (SSDI) in Chichibabin's hydrocarbons (CHs). By controlling the dihedral angle (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;), we create stable, high-spin diradicals, with one candidate, CH(2), exhibiting exceptional spin coherence at room temperature, showcasing its potential as a molecular qubit.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chichibabin's hydrocarbons (CHs) typically exhibit resonance equilibrium between closed-shell quinoidal and open-shell diradical configurations due to the flexible rotation of the molecule structure. We herein report a series of conformationally rigidified CHs achieved through lockage of chiral binaphthalene frameworks. Systematic enhancement of open-shell character was observed with increasing dihedral angles between naphthalene moieties, as evidenced by electronic spectroscopy and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. This conformational locking strategy enables precise engineering of spin&#8211;spin dipolar interactions, unambiguously revealed by zero-field splitting parameters derived from EPR studies. Specifically, CH(2) exhibits excellent ambient stability and exceptional spin coherence at room temperature, with attractive spin-lattice relaxation time (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of 1207&#160;ns and spin dephasing time (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of 205&#160;ns. Our findings establish a molecular design paradigm for controlling electronic coupling in diradical systems, providing critical insights for developing next-generation quantum materials with tailored spin functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Pathway Complexity in Host&#8211;Guest Binding: Allosteric Regulation and Temporal Chiral Inversion During Complexation of Naphtho[2,2]urils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NGU[2,2] undergoes chiral inversion upon sequential binding of chiral guests. Stepwise 1:1 to 1:2 complexation switches conformational preference between SP and RP states, producing CD inversion with transient overshoot&#8212;an unprecedented example of chiral allosteric regulation in host&#8211;guest chemistry. 








Abstract
Studies on pathway complexity in supramolecular polymerization have uncovered intriguing kinetic behaviors, though these are not directly transferable to host&#8211;guest systems. Here, we report unprecedented chiral inversion kinetics in a host&#8211;guest complexation process, arising from the coupling of sequential binding and conformational interconversion. Naphtho[n,n]urils (NGU[n,n]), constructed by alternating glycoluril and naphthyl units, were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component condensation, yielding hybrid architectures with well&#8208;defined cavities. In NGU[2,2], the two naphthyl units adopt either SP or RP planar chiral conformations, giving rise to interconvertible racemic and meso conformers. NGU[2,2] binds chiral amino acid derivatives stepwise through hydrogen bonding and cation&#8211;dipole interactions, forming 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. Complexation shifts the equilibrium between racemic and meso conformers, inducing a circular dichroism (CD) response. Notably, the transition from the 1:1 to the 1:2 complex triggers an inversion of conformational preference in NGU[2,2], representing a unique case of chiral allosteric regulation. Furthermore, temporal inversion of the CD signal was observed upon mixing NGU[2,2] with the guest, displaying a transient overshoot and sign reversal. This kinetic behavior originates from the interplay between binding dynamics and conformational interconversion, with the meso conformer playing a central role.

         <title>High&#8208;Loading Gel Cathodes Enabling Energetic Zinc Metal Batteries with Device&#8208;Level Capacities Beyond 100 Ah L&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
Gel cathodes with improved electrolyte wettability and reaction kinetics are developed for high&#8208;energy zinc batteries. Their elastic polymer network supports mass loading over 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and achieves a device&#8208;level volumetric capacity of 120 Ah L&#8722;1, nearly twice that of conventional solid electrodes, demonstrating substantial potential for scalable energy storage.








Abstract
Zinc metal batteries offer high theoretical capacity but are hindered by the absence of cathodes with capable of matching zinc anodes at high loadings. Herein, we present a gel cathode architecture that leverages the compatibility of hydrogels with aqueous batteries to integrate strong interfacial wettability and a porous framework. This design reduces ion transport tortuosity, accelerates interfacial kinetics, and enables an unprecedented active material loading of 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. As a result, full cells paired with zinc anodes achieve a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art volumetric capacity of 120 Ah L&#8722;1. Furthermore, a 1.8 Ah pouch cell validates the scalability and practical feasibility of this approach, establishing a versatile pathway for developing high&#8208;loading cathodes and advancing energetic zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Diversity&#8208;Oriented Post&#8208;Polymerization Modifications by Developing gem&#8208;Diboryl Polyolefin as a Platform Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for synthesizing gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a strategically designed gem&#8208;diboryl&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropane monomer is disclosed. Utilizing this gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin as a platform polymer enables diversity&#8208;oriented post&#8208;polymerization modifications (DOPPM). The incorporation of gem&#8208;diboryl moiety effectively stabilizes the ring&#8208;opened propagating radical intermediate during polymerization, thereby promoting linear chain growth while suppressing competing 4&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization that would lead to cyclic polymer formation.








Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) serves as a pivotal synthetic strategy for generating libraries of functional polymers from commodity precursors. The pursuit of practical and efficient PPM methods remains a longstanding objective in polymer chemistry. Herein, we report a novel diversity&#8208;oriented post&#8208;polymerization modification (DOPPM) protocol utilizing gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin as a platform polymer. This polymer is readily synthesized via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of a gem&#8208;diboryl&#8208;substituted vinylcyclo&#8208;propane monomer. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the diboryl moiety effectively stabilizes the ring&#8208;opened propagating radical intermediate during polymerization, thereby promoting linear chain growth while suppressing competing 4&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization that would lead to cyclic polymer formation. The gem&#8208;diboryl polyolefin exhibits exceptional reactivity and versatility in DOPPM, enabling its conversion into a wide range of functional polyolefins inaccessible via existing methods.

         <title>Sparingly Solvating Electrolyte with Hofmeister Selectivity for Practical Long&#8208;Lived Li&#8211;Se Batteries</title>

A LiBETI&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte exhibits a Hofmeister&#8208;type anion effect, where bulky chaotropic anions suppress LiPSe solvation, enabling stable cycling of high&#8208;loading Li&#8208;Se batteries.








Abstract
The excessive solvation of lithium polyselenides (LiPSe), which are highly nucleophilic, in organic electrolytes is one of the most critical challenges hindering the practical applications of lithium&#8210;selenium (Li&#8210;Se) batteries. Conventional electrolytes fail to simultaneously ensure the chemical stability with LiPSe, suppress its dissolution, and maintain compatibility with the lithium&#8208;metal anode. To address the above challenges, we report a rationally designed sulfonamide&#8208;based electrolyte with sparingly solvating characteristics, utilizing lithium bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)&#8208; imide (LiBETI) as the lithium salt. An anion&#8208;specific effect analogous to the classical Hofmeister series was identified, in which bulkier and more chaotropic anions suppress the solvation and dissolution of LiPSe. Leveraging this principle, the LiBETI&#8210;sulfonamide electrolyte enables stable cycling of selenium cathodes, delivering a high capacity of &#8204;&#8764;656.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99.5%&#8204; over 200 cycles, along with facilitated kinetics and rate performance. In contrast to conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, the sulfonamide&#8208;based electrolyte not only effectively suppresses LiPSe dissolution but also supports highly reversible Li&#8208;metal anodes. Benefiting both electrodes, our sulfonamide&#8208;based electrolyte enables Li&#8210;Se batteries with high cathode loading (6.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte (&#8764;2.9&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), retaining 89.9% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles. The work highlights the importance of electrolyte design&#8212;particularly anion&#8208;specific effect in achieving long&#8208;lived practical Li&#8211;Se batteries.

Benefiting both electrodes, our sulfonamide-based electrolyte enables Li&#8210;Se batteries with high cathode loading (6.9&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and lean electrolyte (&#8764;2.9&#160;&#181;L mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), retaining 89.9% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles. The work highlights the importance of electrolyte design&#8212;particularly anion-specific effect in achieving long-lived practical Li&#8211;Se batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Bridging Ligand&#8208;Induced Regulated Coordination Chemistry for Highly Reversible Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative four&#8208;nitrogen coordination site electrolyte additive has been introduced to dynamically bridge Zn2+ and the attracted OTf&#8722; ions, especially in the reorganized water&#8208;reduced interfacial environment. This molecule dynamic bridge effect promotes the formation of a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interphase by the anion decomposition, thereby dramatically reducing the parasitic reactions and enhancing reversible Zn deposition stability.








Abstract
The lifespan of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is significantly affected by the Zn anode interfacial hydrogen evolution and uncontrolled dendrite growth. Although the development of versatile organic molecule additives presents a promising solution to mitigate these issues, the limited coordinated capability and uncontrolled electrochemical consumption during cycling remain challenging. Herein, a molecular dynamic bridging strategy is proposed by incorporating tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) into the electrolyte, enabling a highly reversible Zn anode. The TPA additive, featuring four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom coordinated sites, acts as a molecular bridge that dynamically strengthens coordination with Zn2+ and concurrently attracts more OTf&#8722; within the interface. This TPA&#8208;regulated interfacial modulation promotes Zn2+ transport and subsequent OTf&#8722; decomposition, forming a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, thereby significantly reducing side reactions and facilitating reversible Zn deposition. Consequently, the Zn anode with TPA electrolyte demonstrates an extended lifespan of over 4000&#160;h in the symmetric cells and an impressive 99.84% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, Zn||PANI full cell runs over 4000 cycles with 81.9% capacity retention at 3 A g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of a multi&#8208;coordination molecular dynamic bridging strategy to innovatively guide the design of advanced high&#8208;performance electrolyte additives for AZIBs.

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Nanoarray Networks of Atomic Ni&#8208;Incorporated Tungsten Oxynitride for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heteroatom&#8208;induced oriented&#8208;growth strategy is developed to construct the mirror&#8208;symmetric nanoarray networks of atomic Ni&#8208;incorporated tungsten oxynitride (Ni&#8208;WNO) for efficient and robust alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In alkaline HER, Ni&#8208;WNO follows a concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer pathway with accelerated H&#8722;H coupling on atomic W&#8722;Ni units, which offers new perspectives on the surface&#8208;mediated H2 generation.








Abstract
The development of alkali&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is essential for future deployment of anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis technology. Herein, we report a novel heteroatom&#8208;induced strategy to construct the mirror&#8208;symmetric nanoarray networks of Ni&#8208;doped WO3 on carbon cloth and design a corresponding new type of atomic Ni&#8208;incorporated tungsten oxynitride (Ni&#8208;WNO) electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. Impressively, the Ni&#8208;WNO shows high activity (&#8722;35&#160;mV at&#160;&#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), small Tafel slope (32&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and excellent stability (&gt;1200&#160;h at &#8722;1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2), representing the best&#8208;performing W&#8208;based electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. Multiple spectroscopy characterizations reveal that Ni&#8208;WNO is highly active for adsorbing aggressive OH&#8722;/H2O groups, resulting in the in situ formation of lattice hydroxyl (i.e., W&#8722;OH) species with Br&#248;nsted acidity, which, we disclose for the first time, can serve as a mediator to alter the generation of metal&#8722;H intermediates from a conventional sequential to a concerted proton&#8722;electron transfer (CPET) pathway, thus breaking the pH&#8208;dependent limitations in proton&#8208;deficient alkalies. Further isotope experiments demonstrate that the surface&#8208;mediated H&#8722;H coupling can be feasibly accelerated on atomic W&#8722;Ni units, thereby enabling Ni&#8208;WNO catalyzing alkaline HER via a new kinetically fast CPET&#8211;Tafel pathway.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Engineered Electrolyte for Highly Stable and Efficient Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis at 2 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and homogeneous electrolyte&#8208;additive strategy enables highly active and durable oxygen evolution at large current densities in alkaline seawater. The highly electronegative F&#8722; ions modulate the electronic structure of Ni/Fe active sites to enhance OH&#8722; adsorption and OER activity, while simultaneously reinforcing the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to prevent Cl&#8722; corrosion.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis offers an energy&#8208;efficient route for hydrogen production while alleviating freshwater scarcity. However, the presence of Cl&#8722; in seawater compromises anode activity and induces severe corrosion, requiring constructing complex electrode architectures that hinder large&#8208;scale application. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating F&#8722; as an electrolyte additive significantly enhances the performance of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) anodes. Upon optimizing the F&#8722; concentration, benchmark NiFe&#8208;LDH showed the lower overpotential than that of the F&#8722;&#8208;free system, and achieved stable operation at 2 A cm&#8722;2 for 1000 h in seawater electrolyte, representing an approximately 500&#8208;fold improvement over the control set of experiment. The consistency between spectroscopic characterization and multi&#8208;scale simulation results revealed that F&#8722;, by virtue of its high electronegativity and charge density, modulates the electronic environment of Ni and Fe sites, enhances the adsorption of OH&#8722;, and thereby improves OER activity. Moreover, the introduction of F&#8722; increases free water content and modulates the hydrogen bond network to promote OH&#8722; transportation while repelling Cl&#8722; at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface by polarizing the O&#9472;H bonds of water molecules on NiFe&#8208;LDH surface. This straightforward electrolyte engineering strategy provides a practical and scalable solution for seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Intersystem Crossing Efficiency and Bright Polymer Phosphorescence Enabled by Charge&#8208;Transfer Diarylketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 52, December 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer in asymmetric diarylketones was revealed to play pivotal role on their intersystem crossing (ISC), which was poorly understood in previous aromatic ketone phosphors. The ISC could finish within &#8764;10&#160;ps as probed by fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy. Copolymer engineering then translates these molecular properties into 3D materials that exhibit ultrabright and durable phosphorescence, paving the way for large&#8208;area application of organic afterglow. 








Abstract
Bonding aromatic ring to carbonyl group is recognized as crucial for promoting intersystem crossing (ISC) owing to allowed 1n&#960;* &#8594; 3&#960;&#960;* or 1&#960;&#960;* &#8594; 3n&#960;* transition. The effect of charge transfer (CT) in such systems, however, is largely ignored for understanding ISC and phosphorescence efficiency. Here, we unveiled a principle for producing highly&#8208;efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymer where the role of CT in diarylketone phosphors was a prerequisite. Designed diarylketones with carbonyl group substituted by aromatic rings unsymmetrically achieved superior RTP quantum yield of &gt;30% in copolymer. Detailed investigation indicated that 1CT&#8594;3LE (locally excited triplet state) transition with small energy gap (&#8710;EST) and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling underlies their ultrafast ISC, as recorded by femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. When single aromatic ring was bonded to carbonyl group, singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) states remained LE with large &#8710;EST and weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, leading to low RTP efficiency. Finally, manufacturing organic glass in presence of trace diarylketone monomers could generate shape&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional (3D) objects with intense afterglow under room lighting, even at high&#8208;temperature and wet conditions. This work advances understanding on structure&#8208;property relationship in popular aromatic ketone phosphors, and paves the way for producing afterglow materials with high brightness and stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonding aromatic ring to carbonyl group is recognized as crucial for promoting intersystem crossing (ISC) owing to allowed &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;n&#960;* &#8594; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#960;&#960;* or &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#960;&#960;* &#8594; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;n&#960;* transition. The effect of charge transfer (CT) in such systems, however, is largely ignored for understanding ISC and phosphorescence efficiency. Here, we unveiled a principle for producing highly-efficient room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymer where the role of CT in diarylketone phosphors was a prerequisite. Designed diarylketones with carbonyl group substituted by aromatic rings unsymmetrically achieved superior RTP quantum yield of &amp;gt;30% in copolymer. Detailed investigation indicated that &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CT&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LE (locally excited triplet state) transition with small energy gap (&#8710;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) and strong spin-orbit coupling underlies their ultrafast ISC, as recorded by femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy. When single aromatic ring was bonded to carbonyl group, singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) states remained LE with large &#8710;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; and weak spin-orbit coupling, leading to low RTP efficiency. Finally, manufacturing organic glass in presence of trace diarylketone monomers could generate shape-rich three-dimensional (3D) objects with intense afterglow under room lighting, even at high-temperature and wet conditions. This work advances understanding on structure-property relationship in popular aromatic ketone phosphors, and paves the way for producing afterglow materials with high brightness and stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Lattice&#8208;Mismatched Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Strain Zn (0002) Anodes for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>

Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si substrate beneath Zn plate exhibits ultralow lattice mismatch (0.51%) with highly matched interface (0.2320&#160;versus 0.2308&#160;nm), which enables flat nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane with low nucleation strain, high texture strength (Kearns factor 0.85) and low strain accumulation (7.29&#160;versus 0.22&#160;MPa of ASZ), enabling highly reversible and stable Zn anodes for advanced zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Compared with (101&#175;${\mathrm{\bar 1}}$0) and (101&#175;${\mathrm{\bar 1}}$1) planes, Zn (0002) plane with the lowest nucleation energy is optimal for practical rechargeable zinc metal batteries (ZMBs), but precise crystallographic regulation of Zn (0002) plane orientation to significantly reduce intergranular strain accumulation for lasting ZMBs remain challenges. Herein, we develop an Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si substrate with ultralow lattice mismatch (0.51%) to eliminate hierarchical twins and enable flat Zn nucleation for sustainable epitaxial stacking. Negligible lattice spacing deviation (0.2320&#160;versus 0.2308&#160;nm) between Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si (111) and grown&#8208;Zn (0002) plane achieves near&#8208;zero strain in electrodeposited layer (0.22&#160;versus 7.29&#160;MPa of pure Zn foil). Al&#8208;0.1wt%Si&#8208;Zn (ASZ) anode exhibits a pronounced (0002)&#8208;textured Zn orientation with a high Kearns factor (0.85&#160;versus 0.29 of Zn foil), enabling dendrite&#8208;suppressive planar growth. Consequently, ASZ||Cu cells demonstrate 99.83% Coulombic efficiency, while ASZ||ASZ cells operate stably for 8000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, ASZ||MnO2 coin cells retain 73.97% capacity after 1500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, and pouch cells (2.8 Ah) operate over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work opens a new window for designing lattice&#8208;matched, strain&#8208;free zinc anodes for advanced ZMBs.

         <title>Etter Revised: Graph&#8208;Set Analysis for Supramolecular Patterns in Molecular Crystals*</title>

         <dc:description>
Etter's graph&#8208;set notation for hydrogen&#8208;bond patterns in molecular crystals is revised to enable the analysis and categorisation of supramolecular patterns based on any type of non&#8208;covalent interaction (such as hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, and tetrel bonding).








Abstract
A modification to Etter's graph&#8208;set notation for hydrogen&#8208;bond patterns in molecular crystals is proposed to enable the classification of supramolecular patterns based on any type of non&#8208;covalent interaction (such as hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, and tetrel bonding). It is recommended that the modified notation be applied to supramolecular patterns based on interactions other than hydrogen bonds, while retaining the original notation for patterns based solely on hydrogen bonds.
