         <title>Designing Low&#8208;Cost High&#8208;Conductivity and Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolytes towards High&#8208;energy Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Safety hazard induced by flammable electrolytes are troubling the advancement of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes are competent to address this issue, yet current designs struggle to balance the interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity due to the untamed interaction between Na+ and anion. Herein, we evaluate the effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on this interaction, revealing a systematic approach to achieve desired designs. It is shown that incorporating solvents with high DC and moderate Ea forms anion&#8208;rich solvation structure for stabilizing the anode interface and achieving necessary salt dissociation for high ionic conductivity. Specifically, propylene carbonate is incorporated as the eligible solvent into triethyl phosphate, affording non&#8208;flammable electrolytes with low cost and high ionic conductivity of 6.22 mS cm&#8208;1. Consequently, 1.25 Ah hard carbon (HC)|NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) pouch cell delivers a high&#8208;power discharge of 5C rate and maintain an impressive capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, 6.61 Ah HC|NFM pouch cell with 152.3 Wh kg&#8208;1 avoids smoke production and volume expansion during nail penetration. This work discloses an advanced strategy for deigning practical phosphate electrolytes, paving the way for developing high&#8208;performance SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecularly Confined Catalysis in Polyphthalocyanine&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Frameworks Boosts Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phthalocyanines are considered as potent catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) chemistry. However, their adsorption capability is deficient to inhibit polysulfides from shuttling, which in turn retards the S&#8208;redox reaction in cathode. Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether (PPc&#8208;CE) frameworks that provide a supramolecularly confined space created with the single&#8208;atom catalytic nickel phthalocyanine nodes and crown&#8208;ether linkers as Li host. Electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal that a cooperative redox catalysis with the enhanced lithiophilicity of PPc&#8208;CE&#8208;coated carbon nanotubes (PPc&#8208;CE/CNTs) boosts Li&#8211;S redox kinetics and meanwhile, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites for long term. A Li||S cell empolyed with PPc&#8208;CE/CNT catalysts delivers a high discharge capacity of 1,363 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and still retains a specific capacity of ~700 mAh g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 1C. Our work provides insights into the molecular design of redox catalysts for Li&#8211;S batteries based on 2D polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>H2S Donor Functionalized Molecular Machine for Combating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Infected Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chronic wounds are worldwide medical challenge due to the complex and multifaceted etiologies, including bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis. Developing a comprehensive strategy integrating antibiosis and anti&#8208;inflammation to promote revascularization and accelerate wound healing is highly desirable. Nevertheless, current therapeutic methods still face two major challenges: (1) how to combat bacterial drug resistance. (2) how to achieve spatiotemporal control over bacterial elimination and inflammation reduction. To address these issues, a novel H2S donor functionalized molecular machine (MM), ACR&#8208;DM&#8208;HS, was developed. It selectively binds to and disturbs the bacterial membrane through a light&#8208;active vibronic&#8208;driven mechanochemical action (VDA), which synergizes with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently eradicate multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilms, and conquers the evolution of bacterial resistance. Furthermore, it releases H2S in infected tissues to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors, promote angiogenesis and accelerate the healing of diabetic wounds in vivo. This work provides an integrated strategy combining antibiotic and anti&#8208;inflammation to treat with multidrug resistance bacterial infected chronic wounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Crystal&#8208;Structure and Active&#8208;Site of Defective ZnAl&#8208;Catalysts during CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding of surface defects of a catalyst during the reaction process is critical to establish an accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship. Herein, combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/ photoelectron spectroscopy with scanning probe microscope, we have firstly established the correlations between CO2 photoreduction activities and crystal&#8208;structure/active&#8208;site of defective ZnAl layered double hydroxides (ZnAl&#8208;LDH). Specifically, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in ZnAl&#8208;LDH could effectively promote the selective adsorption of both CO2 and H2O molecules on surface Al and Zn active sites, respectively, leading to opposite transition states and the evident shrinking of crystalline structures. Upon light irradiation, the adsorbed CO2 molecules transformed into *COOH intermediate on surface Al active sites, while the H2O molecules dissociated into OH group on Zn sites to provide proton, simultaneously leading to the expansion of crystalline structures and increase of layer spacing. Accordingly, these defect&#8208;dependent evolutions of surface active sites and crystalline structure contributed to the significant improvement of CO2 reduction to CO activity (17.2 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), much higher than that of pristine ZnAl&#8208;LDH (6.3 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). This work provides new insights for in&#8208;depth understanding of the electronic and crystalline changes of defective photocatalysts during the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Diazo Linker Ligand Promotes Flexibility and Induced Fit Binding in a Microporous Copper Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic linkers represent an intuitive and effective strategy to design flexible metal&#8208;organic materials. We report herein a systematic study concerning the effect of varying the central bond of mixed pyridyl&#8208;benzoate linkers, L, upon the flexibility of three isostructural kdd topology microporous coordination networks (CNs) of formula ML2: X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu, 1 = L = (E)&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yldiazenyl)benzoate; X&#8208;kdd&#8208;2&#8208;Cu, 2 = L = (E)&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)benzoate; the previously reported X&#8208;kdd&#8208;3&#8208;Cu, 3 = L = 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzoate. As revealed by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and gas sorption studies, X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu, exhibited gate&#8208;opening during CO2 and hydrocarbon (C2 and C8) sorption experiments whereas the other two CNs did not. Insight into these phase transformations was gained from in situ variable pressure and variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), SCXRD and modelling. Rotation of ligand 1 around the diazo bond, torsion angle changes between phenyl and carboxylate moieties, and deformation of the Cu&#8208;based rod building blocks enabled activated X&#8208;kdd&#8208;1&#8208;Cu to form new phases with C8 isomers and CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2 inducing contraction of the activated phase. Computational studies suggest that 1 enables flexibility thanks to its lower barrier of deformation vs. 2 or 3. This study teaches diazo moieties could offer a general strategy to enhance the flexibility of CNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonia Hydration in a Cu(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate Framework for Efficient Trace Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia (NH3) emissions from industrial and agricultural activities pose severe environmental and health issues. Trace NH3 capture typically relies on chemisorption at Lewis acid sites or physisorption on porous adsorbents, but usually suffers from irreversible binding, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, and structural degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a new hydration pathway as a promising solution. In a Cu(II)&#8208;pyrazolate framework, BUT&#8208;64(H2O), the bridging water molecules between adjacent Cu(II) ions serve as Br&#248;nsted acid sites to hydrate ammonia, achieving a remarkable NH3 packing density of 0.27 g cm&#8211;3 at 0.1 kPa and an adsorption capacity of 1.51 mmol g&#8211;1 for 1000 ppm NH3 under 80% relative humidity, among the leading adsorbents. The reversible hydration mechanism combines enhanced NH3 affinity with facile regeneration, and mitigated moisture co&#8208;adsorption, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;off. The remarkable alkaline stability of this material also highlights its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient sorbent for trace NH3 capture.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH3) emissions from industrial and agricultural activities pose severe environmental and health issues. Trace NH3 capture typically relies on chemisorption at Lewis acid sites or physisorption on porous adsorbents, but usually suffers from irreversible binding, energy-intensive regeneration, and structural degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a new hydration pathway as a promising solution. In a Cu(II)-pyrazolate framework, BUT-64(H2O), the bridging water molecules between adjacent Cu(II) ions serve as Br&#248;nsted acid sites to hydrate ammonia, achieving a remarkable NH3 packing density of 0.27 g cm&#8211;3 at 0.1 kPa and an adsorption capacity of 1.51 mmol g&#8211;1 for 1000 ppm NH3 under 80% relative humidity, among the leading adsorbents. The reversible hydration mechanism combines enhanced NH3 affinity with facile regeneration, and mitigated moisture co-adsorption, overcoming the inherent trade-off. The remarkable alkaline stability of this material also highlights its potential as an energy-efficient sorbent for trace NH3 capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Driven Stepwise Activation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks toward Industrial&#8208;Level Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring well&#8208;defined metal active sites and unique coordination environment, have recently emerged as ideal model catalysts for establishing precise structure&#8208;activity relationships in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, elucidating essential catalytic mechanisms responsible for dynamic reaction conditions remain challenging, primarily due to the complicated adsorption behavior and cross&#8208;step transfer of key adsorbates during OER.  Herein, we propose a defect&#8208;driven stepwise activation strategy to meticulously control the adsorption behavior for defective Co&#8208;based MOF (termed D/CoFc&#8208;MOF) through tailoring the interplay between local coordination geometry and electronic configuration. Operando characterizations reveal that D/CoFc&#8208;MOF undergoes a unique stepwise activation during OER, progressing from pristine MOF state to intermediate a&#8208;FeOOH state, and ultimately to active CoFeOOH phase, which markedly differs from conventional single&#8208;step surface phase conversion. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electronic interaction between the active Co sites and OOH* intermediates of MOF&#8208;derived defective CoFeOOH can be effectively strengthened, thereby overcoming the high reaction barrier and enhancing OER activity. The D/CoFc&#8208;MOF anode, deployed in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves industrial&#8208;scale current densities of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.69 V and operates stably for 300 h. This approach provides a fundamental insight into designing catalysts prone to dynamic phase transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Supramolecular Polymers by pH&#8208;Gated Conformational Control of a Self&#8208;Assembling Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linking a cyclodextrin (CD) host to a hydrophobic guest can result in two distinct conformations: an introverted form (in), in which the guest is self&#8208;included within the CD cavity, and an extraverted form (out), which enables intermolecular interactions and thus the formation of a supramolecular polymer. In this study, we demonstrate that a subtle variation of the linker enables interconversion between these two conformations, the in conformer being thermodynamically the most stable in water. At basic pH (&gt;8) the out conformer is instantly converted into the in. In contrast, at acidic pH (&lt;2), the out monomer can be kinetically trapped and can self&#8208;assemble into a supramolecular polymer. DFT calculations reveal that the interconversion mechanism is governed by a key hydrogen bond that locks the conformational states. Furthermore, we show that pH provides fine kinetic control over the interconversion rate and, consequently, the polymerization process. The system can then be reset toward the out conformation by using DMSO. This system stands in contrast to known transient supramolecular polymerization processes, which rely on metastable (non&#8208;assembled) monomers. Here, it is the kinetic trapping of the assembling monomer that allows control over the lifetime of the transient supramolecular polymer via a pH&#8208;responsive mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>SH2 Decarboxylative Monofluoromethylation of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Nickel/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic construction of alkyl fluorides through C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming transformations represents a formidable challenge in modern organofluorine chemistry. In this work, we present a decarboxylative monofluoromethylation protocol enabled by synergistic nickel/photoredox dual catalysis for aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives. A structurally diverse array of tertiary, secondary, and primary N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters underwent efficient conversion to their corresponding fluoromethylated products with excellent functional group tolerance (68 examples, up to 91% yield). The methodology's versatility was highlighted through late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylation of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal the involvement of a radical rebound pathway mediated by nickel(III) intermediate, with the homolytic substitution (SH2) process at sterically congested center representing a critical mechanistic distinction from conventional cross&#8208;coupling paradigms.</dc:description>

         <title>Decavanadate&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling: An Efficient and Sustainable Approach towards P(O)&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient green protocol has been developed for the cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between thiols and P(O)&#8722;H compounds using decavanadate anion as the catalyst at room temperature under open&#8208;flask conditions. The reaction proceeds efficiently in water or ethanol without any assistance of heat, light, electricity, or unfriendly additives and tolerates a broad spectrum of functional groups, delivering the desired products in up to 95% yield. Importantly, the decavanadate catalyst can be easily recycled in gram&#8208;scale synthesis at least six times without a significant decline in reaction yield. Further mechanistic investigations evidence the formation of quadrivalent vanadium&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;species in the reaction process and reveal that the P(O)&#8722;S dehydrogenative coupling is enabled via a VV to VIV catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Ordering in Low&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskites for Improved X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites are emerging semiconductors with excellent photophysical property, chemical stability and structural diversity, and have shown prominence in the fields of solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray detectors. To date, the inorganic framework structure in perovskites has been intensively studied, but the molecular arrangement of organic counterparts and its impact on physical properties remains largely unexplored. Herein, we engineer the coordination geometry of inorganic and organic building units to implement molecular ordering and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites. We observe a positive dependence of carrier transport capacity and environmental stability on the molecular regularity in hybrid perovskites. Furthermore, 5&#8208;aminoquinoline lead iodide single crystal with the highest regularity exhibit nearly fivefold increased carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product and twentyfold decreased ionic conductivity along [011] than [100] orientation, enabling a high sensitivity of 8.25 &#215; 105 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 under 8 keV X&#8208;ray radiation for radiation detection application. This work sheds light on the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation perovskite&#8208;based semiconductors with enhanced performance and stability for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Toluene to Benzaldehyde by Parallel Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Energy Transfer Through Multiphoton Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selectively aerobic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde is an important but challenging task due to the high proclivity of aldehydes to undergo over&#8208;oxidation to acids. Herein,&#160;we report a new multiphoton excitation approach for synthesizing benzaldehyde from toluene by integrating oxygen vacancy and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events into one coordination polymer (Zn&#8208;AQ) to enhance efficiency and selectivity. Under light irradiation, the ligand facilitates photoinduced PCET and photoinduced energy transfer (EnT), generating radical species from the C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds and highly active 1O2 species. The p&#8208;stacking interactions between the ligands enforced the metal centers to form Zn&#8230;Na&#8230;Zn&#8230;Na polyoxometalate chains with oxygen vacancy sites for the selective oxidation of the radical intermediate.&#160;Zn&#8208;AQ endows the efficient and selective oxidation of aromatic benzyl C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds into aldehydes, including the conversion of toluene into benzaldehyde with the selectivity up to 94%, by combining the energies of three photons in one catalytic cycle. The first reported multiphoton catalytic strategy combines oxygen vacancy catalysis with PCET C(sp3)&#8208;H bond activation mode, providing new ideas for the design of aerobic oxidation photocatalysts for target C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds oxidation in a mild, efficient, and highly selective manner.</dc:description>

The p-stacking interactions between the ligands enforced the metal centers to form Zn&#8230;Na&#8230;Zn&#8230;Na polyoxometalate chains with oxygen vacancy sites for the selective oxidation of the radical intermediate.&#160;Zn-AQ endows the efficient and selective oxidation of aromatic benzyl C(sp3)-H bonds into aldehydes, including the conversion of toluene into benzaldehyde with the selectivity up to 94%, by combining the energies of three photons in one catalytic cycle. The first reported multiphoton catalytic strategy combines oxygen vacancy catalysis with PCET C(sp3)-H bond activation mode, providing new ideas for the design of aerobic oxidation photocatalysts for target C(sp3)-H bonds oxidation in a mild, efficient, and highly selective manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion Induced by Topological Phase Transition in a Potassium Zinc Phosphate Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials exhibits the counterintuitive property of volume contraction upon heating, which is critical for precision engineering applications. While significant progress has been made in NTE material discovery and mechanism understanding, developing cost&#8208;effective systems with strong NTE effects remains challenging. Here we report that an economical phosphate material, KZn(PO3)3, which demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking volumetric contraction (&#916;V/V = &#8722;11.49%) during its low&#8208;temperature to high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This exceptional NTE behaviour originates from an unprecedented topological phase transition involving structural reorganization from infinite (PO4)&#8734;&#8208;chains (C&#8734; symmetry) to discrete P3O9&#8208;rings (C3 symmetry). The variable&#8208;cell nudged elastic band, ab initio molecular dynamics and self&#8208;consistent phonon calculations reveal a threefold mechanism: (1) reduced K&#8722;K distance minimize electrostatic repulsion, (2) covalent bond rearrangement enables the chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformation, and (3) pronounced vibrational modes of O1 atoms destabilize the anionic chains, promoting their cleavage. Concurrently, these cooperative effects drive the observed giant NTE, while the resulting hexagonal&#8208;closed&#8208;packed (hcp) K+ sublattice further enhances structural contraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence Based on Center&#8208;Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) presents a significant challenge, particularly for center&#8208;chiral systems, due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between high luminescence efficiency and large luminescence dissymmetry factors. In this work, we introduce a center&#8208;chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to overcome this limitation. By integrating a stereogenic carbon center into a fluorene scaffold, we create a unique interaction between a boron&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence Lewis acid and an arylamine Lewis base. This sterically hindered design prevents full charge transfer, while optimizing the alignment between electric and magnetic dipole moments, which ultimately amplifies CPL signals. As a result, our CP&#8208;OLEDs achieve impressive electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) of 6.64 &#215; 10&#8208;3, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of up to 30.4%, and sub&#8208;30 nm spectral linewidths. These improvements yield a Figure of Merit (FoM = EQE &#215; |gEL|) of 1.91 &#215; 10&#8208;3, the highest reported for center&#8208;chiral CPL devices. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the center&#8208;chiral FLP design in overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between polarization and efficiency in CP&#8208;OLEDs, paving the way for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking a Ferrocenium Superoxidizer with the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photolytically induced arene displacement of [Fe(C5H5)(oDCB)][PF6] (oDCB = ortho&#8208;dichlorobenzene) in the presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the highly fluorinated and benchstable ferrocene [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)]. The perfluorinated Cp* ligand exerts an extreme electron withdrawing effect on the ferrocene with E1/2 = 1.35 V (vs. Fc/Fc+). This proved to be the highest value obtained for any ferrocene reported so far. The corresponding stable and storable ferrocenium complex [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)][AsF6] was generated in quantitative yield and represents not only the most oxidizing ferrocenium species, but also the strongest known isolable organometallic oxidizer. Its strength was demonstrated by the twofold oxidation of [Fe(C5(CH3)5)2] to its dication and an oxidative C&#8208;H activation of ortho&#8208;terphenyl. This unprecedented redox chemistry combined with perfluorocarbon solubility allows for selective and quantitative recycling of the highly fluorinated ferrocene. Together with the low basicity and inertness of [Fe(C5H5)(C5(CF3)5)], the chemistry of strong oxidizers is herein expanded into organometallics.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Postfunctionalization of Poly(methacrylate) Derivatives via Radical&#8211;Polar Crossover Phosphonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization of polymers with a redox&#8208;active moiety using trialkyl phosphite nucleophiles afforded the corresponding phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers via the radical&#8211;polar crossover process, in which a carbocation equivalent is generated to react with nucleophiles. This strategy provides versatile functional polymers in a simple, green, and sustainable manner. 








Abstract
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization of poly(meth)acrylate&#8208;based copolymers bearing phthalimide moieties can produce novel polymer architectures that are inaccessible using polymerization approaches; however, this method is restricted to radical reactions. To expand the scope of reactions applicable to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization, this study focused on the radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) process, in which a carbocation equivalent is generated to react with nucleophiles. The organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a random copolymer of N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide and methyl acrylate using trialkyl phosphite nucleophiles afforded the corresponding phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers. Although simultaneous hydrogenation was inevitable, a novel polymer comprising dialkyl isopropenylphosphonate, propylene, and methyl acrylate units was obtained, which is of interest because phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers are potentially applicable as thermoresponsive materials, flame&#8208;retardant materials, and additives in Li&#8208;ion batteries. A series of copolymers with different components were successfully applied to the postfunctionalization method. The organophotoredox catalysis&#8208;based postfunctionalization strategy developed in this study provides versatile functional polymers in a simple, green, and sustainable manner.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isodaphlongamine H by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Hydroxylactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of isodaphlongamine H was accomplished by a lactam strategy. This strategy started with alkylation and N&#8208;oxidation of a readily available chiral lactam. For the key functionalization of the amide carbonyl, an iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of the N&#8208;hydroxylactam afforded the tricyclic isoxazolidine, which was successfully transformed to isodaphlongamine H. Bn&#160;=&#160;benzyl, TBAF&#160;=&#160;tetrabutylammonium fluoride.








Abstract
The total synthesis of isodaphlongamine H based on a lactam strategy, which enables quick access to complex cyclic amines, is described. The strategy begins with alkylation of a chiral lactam and subsequent N&#8208;oxidation via an imino ether to afford the N&#8208;hydroxylactam. For the key transformation to functionalize the amide carbonyl, an iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of the N&#8208;hydroxylactam provides a tricyclic isoxazolidine in a one&#8208;pot process. After the coupling reaction with an allylic silane fragment, the total synthesis is accomplished through intramolecular Hosomi&#8211;Sakurai allylation to construct a pentacyclic core. The deoxygenated pentacyclic intermediate shows higher cytotoxicity against HeLa and U937 cell lines than isodaphlongamine H, and might become a lead compound for further biological study.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Triggered Orbital Hybridization in FeMn Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Toward Sabatier&#8208;Optimized Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn dual&#8208;atom catalyst on a porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is synthesized via a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. The defect&#8208;mediated coordination strengthens Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization, optimizing adsorption energy toward Sabatier optimality. The catalyst delivers a 0.921&#160;V half&#8208;wave potential for alkaline oxygen reduction and excellent Zn&#8208;air battery performance.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSAs), leveraging synergistic dual&#8208;site interactions, represent a promising frontier in electrocatalysis. However, the precise synthesis of dual&#8208;atom pairs and fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic structures remain significant challenges. Herein, we construct a defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn&#8208;DSA anchored on a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeMnDSA/dNC) through a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. This defect modulation strategy effectively stabilizes dual atomic pairs while optimizing electronic structures to approach Sabatier's optimality, significantly boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The FeMnDSA/dNC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.921&#160;V in alkaline media, with assembled zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrating 291&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density and stable charge/discharge cycling for over 500&#160;h. Theoretical calculations reveal that defect&#8208;mediated coordination adjacent to Fe&#8208;Mn diatomic centers triggers charge redistribution, suppressing antibonding orbital populations while strengthening Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization. This modulation weakens O&#9472;O bonding through optimized *OOH adsorption configurations, thereby enhancing ORR kinetics. The present work provides valuable insights into the precise modulation and the underlying mechanisms of DSAs, advancing the design of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Manipulation of Hydrogen Transfer Behaviors by RhCu Alloying Enables an All&#8208;in&#8208;one Sustainable &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system by coupling the rational conversions from nitrogen&#8208;oxysalts and biomass&#8208;derived&#8208;aldehydes (industrial/agricultural wastes). The poor reaction kinetics are efficaciously optimized by RhCu alloy electrocatalyst with dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation properties. So, nitrate and furfural can be simultaneously converted into multiple non&#8208;mixed valuable products (NH3, H2, etc.) with electricity output.








Abstract
Nitrate&#160;and furfural are typical wastes mainly from industrialization and agriculturalization progresses, and their clean conversions are still very challenging for a sustainable future. Nevertheless, scant attention has been devoted to the core&#160;issues: the rational integration of two wastes recycling and the targeted manipulation of hydrogen (H*) transfer behaviors to address their sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system that is thermodynamically designed by coupling nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and furfural oxidation reactions (FORs) together. Particularly, the poor kinetics for both electrode reactions are efficaciously optimized by the bifunctional electrocatalyst of RhCu alloy nanowires on copper foam (RhCu NW/CF) with highly improved dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation performances, thus initializing NO3RR for NH3 synthesis at +0.31&#160;V and driving FOR for H2 harvest at an onset potential lower than 0&#160;V. Eventually, such integrated &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; system can simultaneously effectuate the electricity energy supply (10.76&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), wastewater purification, cathodic hydrogen storage (NH3), anodic H2 production, and biomass upgrading. Hence, it provides a promising perspective of &#8220;turning waste into treasure&#8221; in a rational manner, justifying its all&#8208;in&#8208;one property in addressing the global challenge of sustainable energy.

         <title>Dihydrophenazine Derived Pd6L12 Cage: Self&#8208;Assembly, Polyradical Cations, and Lithium Battery Cathode Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesized a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12 coordination cage (Cage 1) with excellent redox activity. It can reversibly transform into its radical cation form (112&#8226;+) via electrochemical or chemical oxidation/reduction. Both forms' structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In situ spectroelectrochemical techniques verified their redox reversibility and electrochromic behavior. Cage 1 was also used as a lithium battery cathode, with its redox behavior studied by in situ 2D EPR.








Abstract
In this study, we present the self&#8208;assembly of a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12&#8208;type coordination cage 1 showing excellent redox activity and demonstrate the use as the cathode for lithium batteries. The structure of cage 1 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The excellent reversible redox performance of 1 and its electrochromic properties induced by radical species were systematically characterized using in situ UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Notably, a highly stable radical cationic species 112&#8226;+, containing 12 radical cations, was successfully obtained through the chemical oxidation of 1, and its single&#8208;crystal structure was resolved. The excellent redox properties of 1 enable its application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. The 1|Li cell exhibited good cycling stability, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, and an initial discharge capacity of 84 mAh g&#8315;&#185; within a voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.0&#160;V. Furthermore, in situ 2D EPR experiments on lithium batteries visually revealed the excellent cycling stability of the 1&#8208;based cathode material and its reversible two&#8208;step electron transfer process. This study provides important insights into the design, synthesis, and properties of functionalized redox&#8208;active coordination cages, offering a reference for their application in energy storage and functional materials research.

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the highly efficient Qx series of small molecules, we have synthesized T&#8208;Qxs, which are shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecules with high glass transition temperature. The miscibility with the polymer donor PM6 was fine&#8208;tuned by modulation of the central and terminal atoms, thereby altering the molecular distortion angle. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl achieve both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high thermal stability.








Abstract
The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development into organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188 &#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21&#160;eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93&#160;V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.

         <title>High&#8208;Security and High&#8208;Efficiency Information Encryption/Decryption Based on 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites via Delicate Organic&#8208;Cation Engineering</title>

         <dc:description>
We develop a unique strategy of information encryption/decryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence of 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering. The facile triple&#8208;key implementation working in multiple switching modes (featuring high contrast and quick response) allows us to achieve high security and readout efficiency, opening a new door to information security based on optical encryption.








Abstract
Optical encryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (SRL) materials has received enormous interest in the field of information security. Metal&#8211;halide perovskites, as a newly emerging SRL material, have shown great potential for confidential information encryption/decryption (InfoED) applications. However, it is rather challenging to ensure high security and achieve high readout efficiency in perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED. Herein, we present a unique InfoED strategy using 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering, benefiting from the high contrast and quick response of their photoluminescence behaviors. Indistinguishably encrypted information can be efficiently decrypted through triple&#8208;key implementation (i.e., ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation, temperature control, and narrow&#8208;bandpass filtering) that operates in multiple switching modes, enabling us to demonstrate extremely high security by adopting dot&#8208;matrix patterning scenarios that are virtually uncrackable. As a proof of principle, a simple 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 patterning can yield a code dictionary with random variants as high as &#8764;1047, which will take as long as &#8764;1022 years to crack using the hitherto fastest supercomputer, El Capitan. Our perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED strategy provides a promising solution for information security based on optical encryption.

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 Is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and Is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimization Against Malaria</title>

         <dc:description>
AZD0156, an ATM kinase inhibitor in clinical development, shows promising multistage antiplasmodial activity by targeting Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase (PfPI4K&#946;). With an improved specificity profile relative to other PfPI4K&#946; inhibitors and moderate efficacy in a P. berghei disease model, AZD0156 is an attractive candidate for medicinal chemistry optimization against malaria.








Abstract
New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical, and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta (PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 &#215; 50 mg kg&#8722;1) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimization approach.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acyclic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted esters with aryl bromides is established for the first time by employing P&#8208;chiral monophosphorus ligand 3&#8208;Pent&#8208;BIDIME as a chiral ligand, leading to a series of enantioenriched &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl esters possessing quaternary carbon stereocenters in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivities. The method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, excellent functional group compatibility, and low Pd loadings (as low as 1&#160;mol%). Its synthetic utilities are exemplified by the efficient preparation of a chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl substituted &#947;&#8208;lactone and the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;amolanone.

         <title>Regulated Second&#8208;sphere Coordination in Amorphous Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy is employed by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU), with efforts to trigger more orbital interactions with guest molecules. Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is chosen to transform rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. Such architecture with clear and unique second&#8208;sphere interaction can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecule and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation.








Abstract
The endeavor toward photocatalytic CO2 fixation is largely hampered by the rigid spatial configurations and inadequate orbital overlap between the catalytic site and CO2. Herein, we propose a second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU). Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is constructed as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to achieve creative control over the second coordination sphere. Such architecture transforms rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. This shift can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecules and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation. Both in situ experiments and theoretical calculations verify second&#8208;sphere engineering endows the Lewis base sites with high electron donating capacity and promotes the electron injection into the &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of the CO2 molecule effectively. Hence, the a&#8208;MOF displays approximately double the yield in various photocatalytic CO2 reactions compared with its crystalline counterpart. Moreover, its photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2 battery delivers higher discharging voltage and a fourfold increment of discharge capacity at 200&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. The unique ability to tailor the secondary coordination sphere performs attractive merits governing the small molecule binding affinity, aiming to manipulate the local microenvironment of open metal sites for efficient CO2 fixation.

         <title>Interfacial Water Structure Modulation on Unconventional Phase Non&#8208;Precious Metal Alloy Nanostructures for Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free CuNi alloy nanostructures with unconventional hcp/fcc heterophase has been successfully achieved. Notably, hcp/fcc CuNi nanoalloys demonstrate much superior catalytic performance toward ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrate than the common fcc CuNi counterparts. Mechanism studies reveal that the hcp/fcc CuNi alloys facilitate the formation of K+&#8211;H2O, enhance the interfacial water dissociation, and create high *H coverage, thereby boosting the ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been recognized as a sustainable route for nitrate removal and value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Regulating the surface active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial but remains a formidable challenge, especially in neutral electrolytes, greatly limiting the highly selective NH3 formation. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of heterophase hcp/fcc non&#8208;precious CuNi alloy nanostructures for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis in neutral media. Significantly, hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 exhibits excellent performance with NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.1% and 57.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, respectively. In situ studies suggest that the high proportion of interfacial K+ ion hydrated water (K+&#8211;H2O) on hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 creates high *H coverage via boosting interfacial water dissociation, enabling the rapid hydrogenation kinetics for NH3 synthesis. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior NO3RR performance of hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 originates from both the existence of hcp phase to improve the electroactivity and the high Ni content to guarantee an efficient active hydrogen supply. The strong interaction between Ni and Cu also optimizes the electronic structures of Cu sites to realize fast intermediate conversions with low energy barriers. This work provides a novel strategy to optimize surface *H behavior via tuning interfacial water structure by crystal phase control.

         <title>Turing&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Precise Peptide Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Turing&#8208;structured COF membrane with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures is created via the modulation based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry. The resulting COF membrane exhibits simultaneously enhanced water permeation and molecular sieving properties, demonstrating its great potential in the separation of high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Turing structures have emerged as promising features for separation membranes, enabling significantly enhanced water permeation due to their ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities. So far, Turing structures are constrained by the highly cross&#8208;linked and heterogeneous porosities, impeding them from the application of molecular separations requiring loose but regular pore structures. This work reports a covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membrane with nanoscale striped Turing structures for fast and precise molecular separations. Porous and hydrophilic modulation layers based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry are constructed on polymeric substrates, which are capable of enhancing the uptake and controlled release of the activator of amines during synthesis. The appropriately reduced diffusion rate triggers the phenomenon of &#8220;local activation and lateral inhibition&#8221; arising from thermodynamic instability, creating Turing structures with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures. The Turing&#8208;type COF membranes exhibit a water permeance of 45.0 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is approximately 13 times greater than the non&#8208;Turing membranes, and an ultrahigh selectivity of up to 638 for two model peptides. This work demonstrates the feasibility that Turing structures with ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities can be created in COF membranes and underscores their superiority in molecular separations, including but not limited to high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Spin State Modulation in Spinel Oxides for Enhanced Nonradical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a strategy that leverages site&#8208;specific spin state modulation in spinel oxides, which optimizes site&#8208;specific functionalities and enhances the overall nonradical oxidation reaction kinetics by 22&#8208;fold. XAS, magnetism characterization combined with theoretical calculation unveil the establishment of a QSEI that facilitates spin channel for charge transfer and the RDS desorption with a lower&#8208;ICOHP in fine&#8208;tuned spin states.








Abstract
Spinel oxides hold tremendous potential for driving advanced oxidation processes, yet the underlying mechanism for maximizing their activity remains unclear. In this study, we leverage tetrahedral and octahedral site interactions in MnxCo3&#8208;xO4 to modulate the spin states, specifically spin alignment and spin moment, thereby enhancing periodate (PI) activation and catalytic performance in contaminant degradation. Through combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, we elucidate the role of spin alignment at synergetic tetrahedral and octahedral sites in facilitating quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) with an efficient electronic spin channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, the engineered high spin configuration in CoMn2O4 raises the d&#8208;band center, favoring stable PI* surface complex formation and accelerating the rate&#8208;determining desorption of IO3&#8722; with a lower&#8208;ICOHP value during the catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the fine&#8208;tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to MnCo2O4 and up to 22&#8208;fold increase compared to the octahedrally&#8208;active only catalysts. Such a site&#8208;specific modulation has been found applicable to other spinel oxides, enlightening fine&#8208;tuned electronic structure for maximizing catalytic performance.

         <title>Electrochemical Benzylic C&#9472;H Sulfation beyond the O&#8208;Sulfonation Limitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct method for benzylic C&#9472;H sulfation via electrooxidation was developed. This transformation shows orthogonal reactivity to classical O&#8208;sulfonation, allowing for the direct sulfation of feedstock chemicals with hydroxyl groups without the need for complicated protecting&#8208;group strategies. The chemo&#8208; and site selectivity of this reaction makes it a valuable tool for the late&#8208;stage sulfation of natural products and drug molecules.








Abstract
Direct C&#9472;H sulfation represents a valuable transformation for the synthesis of organosulfates. However, it has been challenging to achieve owing to the presence of multiple C&#9472;H bonds with comparable strengths and steric environments. Current methods for producing organosulfates primarily rely on O&#8208;sulfonation, which limits their applicability to hydroxyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a practical and cost&#8208;efficient method for the electrochemical sulfation of benzylic C&#9472;H bonds. This reaction avoids the need for strong oxidants, demonstrating broad substrate scope, excellent chemoselectivity, and site selectivity. The orthogonal reactivity of this protocol is particularly evident in the transformation of alcohol substrates.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific On&#8208;Site Activation of Cisplatin via Cascade Catalytic&#8208;Redox Reactions for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of cisplatin (cDDP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cDDP in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis for highly efficient chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficiency of platinum drugs is always limited by low utilization, side effects, and Pt&#8208;resistance. Herein, a double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine named PtNP@Cu has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of dechlorinated cisplatin (DP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cisplatin (cDDP) in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis of cancer cells. This design avoids the premature release of active PtII species in normal cells or in the cytoplasm of cancer cells before reaching nucleus, thereby ensuring maximum amplification of Pt&#8208;DNA crosslinking with tumor&#8208;specificity. Meanwhile, substantial GSH depletion and ROS production induced by cascade catalytic&#8208;redox reactions results in ferroptosis of cancer cells, which further reduces GSH&#8208;mediated cDDP detoxification, overcomes Pt&#8208;resistance, and enhances immunogenicity, ultimately realizing highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy and antitumor immunity in vivo. This work provides a new strategy for effectively and comprehensively addressing the issues of low utilization, side effects, and drug resistance problems of platinum drugs, which is also promising for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is engineered, featuring In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites that establish dual&#8208;channel carrier transfer pathways and substantially prolong photogenerated carrier lifetimes five&#8208;fold. These synergistic effects enable direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR for efficient H2O2 production from O2 in pure water, achieving a record apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm among inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts.








Abstract
The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers from sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#9472;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3&#160;wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;Green Fine&#8208;Tunable Narrowband Delayed Fluorescence in Peripherally Dendritic Modified Bis&#8208;Indolocarbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exquisite color tuning of narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence from deep&#8208;blue to green was achieved for non&#8208;boron ubiquitous luminophores based on the dendritic modification design concept. The corresponding OLEDs exhibited high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green electroluminescence, with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.0% and 28.5%, respectively, and CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.10) and (0.21, 0.68).








Abstract
Highly efficient narrowband organic luminophores offer immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity of electroluminescence (EL). Appropriately controlling their structural relaxation and vibronic couplings between the excited and ground states enables the desired narrowband emissions. Herein, based on a design concept featuring dendritic modifications, we demonstrate the exquisite color tuning of narrowband emissions from deep blue to green in non&#8208;boron ubiquitous molecular systems. By attaching two or four arylamine&#8208;based dendritic units to the periphery of the indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]indolo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;,3&#8242;:1,7]indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole (BICz) core, BICz&#8208;1.5G, BICz&#8208;2G, and BICz&#8208;2GII were developed as deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, and green narrowband emitters, respectively. Comprehensive photophysical and computational studies revealed that the dendritic modifications do not impair the inherent narrowband emission ability of BICz while enhancing its thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. OLEDs incorporating BICz&#8208;1.5G and BICz&#8208;2GII demonstrated high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green EL, with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 24.0% and 28.5%, respectively, and CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.10) and (0.21, 0.68). Our findings will contribute to expanding the search space for narrowband organic luminophores.

         <title>Chloromethylation Modified Pyranonitrile&#8208;Based Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Selective One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;modification strategy employing a chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production of covalent microporous polymers (CMPs). The H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP namely DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl reached 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, which is 6.7 times greater than that of the unmodified photocatalyst.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production utilizing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)&#8208;based photocatalysts represents a crucial green technology for achieving solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Proper material design is paramount to improve the dispersity and charge transfer of CMPs for enhanced H2O2 production performance. Herein, a post&#8208;modification strategy employing chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production. The simple one&#8208;step chloromethylation reaction simultaneously achieved two objectives: One is enhanced hydrophilicity through the hydrolysis of cyanogen groups in the pyranonitrile unit to carboxyl groups, the other&#160;is the improved O2 adsorption and charge transfer by incorporating chloromethyl groups. The two objectives synergistically enhanced the H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP named DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl, reaching 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, 6.7&#8208;fold of the unmodified photocatalyst. Moreover, the rate achieved at an O2 atmosphere increased by only 1.8%, highlighting its superior O2 utilization efficiency in air. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding most reported polymer photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results corroborated the predominant role of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway in the H2O2 generation. This work demonstrates the potential of a post&#8208;modification method to significantly enhance H2O2 production performance directly from water and air.

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) Toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol was developed to scale up ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs with simple formate, enabling one&#8208;step direct separation of C2H4 from the binary C2H2/C2H4 or ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 gas mixtures with high separation efficiency and cost&#8208;saving preparation.








Abstract
The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses toward low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.

         <title>Tri&#8208;Coordinated Boron Species in Confined Boron Oxide Catalysts for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined BOx@SiO2 with highly dispersed BOx species was synthesized by the in situ transformation of BN@SiO2, which showed a remarkable activity of a unique C3H8 conversion uprush increasing from 5.3% at 410&#160;&#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key for the efficient C3H8 activation was the increased amount of tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH derived from the dispersion of molten BOx species within spatially confined SiO2.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward synthesis of confined boron&#8208;based catalysts commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low&#8208;temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8211;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#9472;O&#9472;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angles of O&#9472;B&#9472;O and B&#9472;O&#9472;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly in molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#9472;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.

         <dc:description>
This investigation demonstrates an efficient synthetic methodology for the fabrication of atomically dispersed cobalt species anchored on carbon nitride substrate, featuring distinctive asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination environments and hierarchical active sites. The unique electronic structure of this single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits strengthened driving force and boosted charge carrier transport properties, manifesting in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics during the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A contaminants in wastewater.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted growing interest in solar&#8208;driven catalysis, though challenges persist due to symmetrical metal coordination, which results in limited driving force and sluggish charge dynamics. Additionally, uneven energy and mass distribution complicate reaction pathways, ultimately restricting solar energy utilization and catalytic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized cobalt single atoms decorated carbon nitride catalysts featuring a highly asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination, tailored for photocatalytic organic pollutants removal. Advanced experimental studies and simulation results collectively revealed that the unique microenvironment surrounding Co single atoms improved charge dynamics and created reactive hot spots, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species during the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. These enhanced charge dynamics, combined with hierarchical active sites, resulted in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics and excellent stability for the degradation of bisphenol A in wastewater, distinctly outperforming the first&#8208;stage kinetics observed for polymeric carbon nitride. This work advances the understanding of structure&#8208;performance relationships in SAC&#8208;based photocatalytic degradation and offers valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation SACs in environmental catalysis.

         <title>Boosting Urea Electrosynthesis via Asymmetric Oxygen Vacancies in Zn&#8208;Doped Fe2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 catalysts with Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites can promote the conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO and the coupling of *NO + *CO and thus improve the urea electrosynthesis. It exhibits an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% with a production rate of 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) provides an attractive pathway for storing renewable electricity and substituting traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. However, the kinetics mismatching between CO2 reduction and NO3&#8722; reduction, as well as the difficulty of C&#9472;N coupling, are major challenges in urea electrosynthesis. Herein, we first calculated the free energy of *CO, *OCNO, and *NOH formation over defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts with different metal dopants, which showed that Zn dopant was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we developed Zn&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts (Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV) containing asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites. It exhibited an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% and the remarkable recycling stability. The production rate of urea was as high as 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, which is higher than most of the reported works to date. Detailed control experiments and in situ spectroscopy analyses identified *OCNO as a crucial intermediate for C&#9472;N coupling. The Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV catalyst with asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites showed enhanced *CO coverage and promoted *OCNO formation, leading to high efficiency toward urea production.

         <title>Dopant and Exfoliation Induced Simultaneous Modification of Charge Density and C&#9472;C Coupling Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into higher carbon products demands precise catalyst engineering. In this study, we implemented a dual doping strategy in AgBiP&#8322;S&#8326; to optimize charge density and enhance active sites for C&#9472;C coupling. This approach successfully enabled the synthesis of ethylene through the photoreduction of CO2, showcasing the effectiveness of the modified catalyst design.








Abstract
The photochemical conversion of CO2 into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In&#8208;doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO2 reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C2H4 reached 54.3&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn&#8208;doped AgBiP2S6 catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion technologies.

         <title>Simultaneous Improvement of Mechanical Strength, Toughness, and Self&#8208;healability of Elastomers Enabled by F&#9472;H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Based Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic strategy for simultaneously improving mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healability of elastomers is developed by leveraging F&#9472;H bonds for nanoconfinement to form small and dense nanodomains, resulting in the highest recorded puncture energy and unprecedented fracture energy elastomer thus far.








Abstract
There are often trade&#8208;offs among high mechanical strength, high toughness, and efficient self&#8208;healing. Herein, we present a biomimetic strategy utilizing F&#9472;H bonds for nanoconfinement to achieve the simultaneous enhancement of these conflicting properties. The mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healing efficiency of a fluorinated crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) (CPUU&#8208;FA) elastomer are improved 1.3&#8208;, 1.5&#8208;, and 1.2&#8208;fold, respectively, compared with those of its nonfluorinated counterpart. Notably, the CPUU&#8208;FA has the highest recorded puncture energy (887 mJ) among polymeric elastomers and the highest fracture energy (117&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) among reported thermoset elastomers. Moreover, it exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency (99%), remarkable reprocessability, and a low surface energy (56&#160;MJ m&#8722;2). The application of self&#8208;healing elastomers in the fabrication of soft electronics is further demonstrated. The molecular design strategy is anticipated to inspire new developments in high&#8208;performance materials for cutting&#8208;edge applications.

         <title>Ternary Aldehyde&#8211;Copper&#8211;Iridium Catalysis Enables Stereodivergent Allylation via &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of unprotected primary amines has been developed using aldehyde/Cu/Ir ternary catalysis. This catalytic system enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Notably, this method establishes a sophisticated asymmetric induction model for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine&#8208;containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of primary &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH2 group. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally&#160;&gt;20:1 dr and&#160;&gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts.

     alt="Ternary Aldehyde&#8211;Copper&#8211;Iridium Catalysis Enables Stereodivergent Allylation via &#945;-C-H Functionalization of Primary Amines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A direct enantio- and diastereodivergent &#945;-allylation of unprotected primary amines has been developed using aldehyde/Cu/Ir ternary catalysis. This catalytic system enables the synthesis of &#945;-tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Notably, this method establishes a sophisticated asymmetric induction model for asymmetric &#945;-C-H functionalization of unprotected primary amines.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine-containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;-C-H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio- and diastereodivergent &#945;-allylation of primary &#945;-amino-chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. A wide range of &#945;-tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities (generally&#160;&amp;gt;20:1 dr and&#160;&amp;gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;-tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the asymmetric induction model for the &#945;-C-H functionalization of primary amines was meticulously elucidated through comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Soft Self&#8208;Assembly from Melt: The Ubiquitous Heat Capacity Hump and Spontaneous Melt Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transition from melt to most complex liquid crystal (LC) phases is weak 1st order but is preceded by a large heat capacity maximum. In addition, a chiral liquid forms through another transition before that to the LC, despite the compounds being achiral. We investigate these poorly understood phenomena experimentally and develop a statistical theory that fits the experiments remarkably well, giving new insights into the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly and pre&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We investigate two unusual phenomena in self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic molecules from isotropic (Iso) melt: a heat&#8208;capacity (Cp) maximum and spontaneous formation of the recently discovered chiral liquid (Iso*). Based on experiments on new nonchiral monomers, dimers, and polymers, we construct a statistical theory that shows why many complex meso&#8208;structures form in two stages: continuous equilibrium growth of nano&#8208;clusters in melt through strong interactions, causing the Cp&#8208;maximum, followed by establishment of positional long&#8208;range order (LRO) through a weak first&#8208;order transition. We also show why many achiral compounds additionally form an intermediate chiral Iso* liquid through what we find is a second&#8208;order transition. We propose that the first process is equivalent to &#8220;supramolecular polymerization&#8221; in solutions, where the lack of intercluster interaction rules out LRO. Furthermore, we argue that separation into a broad and a sharp transition is universal in condensed matter where strong interactions by themselves cannot lead to LRO, either because the clusters are 1D or due to strong frustration. Clusters must first grow to critical size when, at Tc, the combined weak interactions reach &#8764;kBTc, prompting LRO formation. A situation similar to that in soft self&#8208;assembly is seen in spin ordering in magnetic crystals, but only near 0&#160;K.

         <title>Visualization Analysis of Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions in Real Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews various methods that based on real space functions for visually studying covalent and noncovalent interactions. Methods such as NCI, IRI, IGM, IGMH, amIGM, ELF, LOL, ESP, and vdW potential, are systematically introduced, with applications demonstrating their practical value. The Multiwfn program, supporting all introduced methods, is also briefly mentioned. These approaches provide chemists with very clear, intuitive representations of interatomic interactions, making them invaluable for studying bonding and weak interactions in a wide variety of chemical systems. 








Abstract
Understanding the types and locations of interactions between atoms or molecules within a chemical system is a fundamental concern in chemistry. In the field of theoretical and computational chemistry, wavefunction analysis offers various methods based on functions defined in 3D real space, enabling the visual representation of both covalent and noncovalent interactions. These methods provide researchers with an intuitive understanding of molecular interactions and are gaining increasing attention. This review systematically introduces various widely adopted and distinctive visualization methods, such as the noncovalent interaction (NCI) method, the independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition of molecular density (IGMH), the interaction region indicator (IRI), the electrostatic potential (ESP), the electron localization function (ELF), and deformation density. Additionally, numerous application examples are provided to help readers recognize the significant practical value of these methods. Also the computer program Multiwfn, which effectively implemented all the introduced methods, is briefly mentioned.

         <title>Phenacetin[3]Arenes: Mannich&#8208;Type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;step acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation of phenacetin and its analogues with paraformaldehyde provides a facile route to hourglass&#8208;shaped phenacetin[3]arenes with distinct functionalized rims in good yields. These novel macrocyclic arene show excellent binding properties and offer the potential for chirality sensing.








Abstract
This work introduces a novel NAm&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot condensation of &#8208; Phenacetin and its homologs with formaldehyde, yielding phenacetin[3]arenes (Ph[3]s) in yields up to 25.9%. Ph[3] exhibits an unsymmetrical hourglass&#8208;shaped architecture, featuring an upper rim adorned with amide groups and a lower rim comprising an alkoxylbenzene cavity. This unique structure facilitates reversible equilibrium between conformers via benzene ring flipping, which simultaneously reverses the orientation of amide groups, establishing equilibrium between C3 and F conformers. Increasing concentrations of organic ammonium guests lead to a transition from a predominantly 1:1 to 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexation. The estimated binding constants for the 1:1 complexes are in the order of 104&#8211;105&#160;M&#8722;1, the overall binding constants for the 1:2 complexes are greater than 106&#160;M&#8722;2. This stepwise complexation triggers a conformational shift from the C3 to F conformer, demonstrating intriguing allosteric behavior. Furthermore, interactions with chiral guests selectively influence the equilibrium of planar chiral conformers, generating chiroptical responses suitable for chirality sensing applications. The distinct functional groups on the two rims facilitate diverse chemical modifications, including reduction, deprotection, and condensation, providing synthetic flexibility for post&#8208;chemical modifications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical allylic substitution method that directly functionalizes unprotected allylic alcohols, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization and toxic reagents. Utilizing iron's unique redox and oxophilic properties, this approach offers a step&#8208;economic and sustainable pathway to allylic functionalization. This method expands the synthetic toolbox and demonstrates the versatility of outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms in radical&#8208;based reactions, facilitating the efficient synthesis of diverse molecular architectures.








Abstract
Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate preactivation to address high C&#9472;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low&#8208;valent iron to promote selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional E/Z selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method's versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical&#8208;based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclohexane Ring Formation in Forazoline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FrazP2, a cytochrome P450, catalyzes cyclohexane ring formation in forazoline A, a marine&#8208;derived antifungal from Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499. Structural and mechanistic studies have uncovered a radical&#8208;mediated cyclization, unlocking opportunities to engineer P450s for the generation of novel antifungal forazoline analogues.








Abstract
Forazoline A, produced by the marine actinomycete Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499, is a unique PK/NRP hybrid macrolactone with promising antifungal in vivo efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism. Although a PKS/NRPS gene cluster was identified as a candidate for forazoline production, the precise biosynthetic pathway and the functions of the tailoring enzymes remain unclear. In this work, the functions of three cytochrome P450 mono&#8208;oxygenases (FrazP1P2P3) were characterized. Notably, FrazP2 was found to mediate cyclohexane ring formation from an 1,3,6&#8208;triene precursor during forazoline A biosynthesis, as confirmed by genetic and biochemical analysis. To gain structural and mechanistic insight into the activity of FrazP2, the crystal structure of a FrazP2&#8208;substrate complex has been solved at 2.3&#160;&#197; resolution. The molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction by FrazP2. These findings expand our understanding of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome P450s, contributing to the diversification of natural products and enabling the creation of unnatural derivatives with increased antifungal potency.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Arylative Dearomatization of Naphthols and Phenols for Constructing Quinazoline&#8208;Containing Spirocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional quinazoline&#8208;containing spiro&#8208;cyclohexadienone through palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylative dearomatization is reported. This transformation demonstrated a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The antiproliferative activity against hematological malignancy cell lines is evaluated, demonstrating that (S)&#8208;4ac is a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylative dearomatization of phenols and naphthols, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. This approach enables the efficient construction of a diverse library of quinazoline&#8208;containing spirocyclic compounds, featuring enantioenriched, three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures through the strategic integration of quinazolinone and spirocyclic frameworks. The successful transformation of planar aromatic precursors into complex three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures using our developed methodology was further validated by principal moment of inertia (PMI) calculations. Additionally, we systematically evaluated the antiproliferative potential of the synthesized compounds against two representative cancer cell lines: Mino (human mantle cell lymphoma) and MV4&#8208;11 (human acute myeloid leukemia), revealing that compound (S)&#8208;4ac, characterized by well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and structural novelty, exhibited significantly enhanced antiproliferative efficacy against both cancer cell lines, with IC50 values 0.9&#160;&#181;M and 0.5&#160;&#181;M, respectively. In addition, flow cytometry quantification and western blot analysis showed that these compounds induced apoptosis through caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results demonstrated (S)&#8208;4ac as a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.

         <title>Activating Surface Oxygen in Ce/Mo&#8208;Doped Ni Oxyhydroxide for Synergistically Enhancing Furfural Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mo/Ce co&#8208;doped Ni oxyhydroxide was prepared for the electrochemical oxidation of furfural coupled with hydrogen evolution. Mo promotes the adsorption of furfural while Ce promotes the formation of OOH, and the synergistic effect of Ce and Mo leads to an industrial current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at only 1.46&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
The integration of biomass&#8208;platform molecule oxidation with water electrolysis is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production and obtain high&#8208;value chemicals simultaneously, yet the efficiency of organic oxidation requires further improvement. Herein, we developed a highly efficient Ce, Mo co&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, where Mo with high spin state promotes the adsorption of furfural (FA), while Ce activates surface lattice oxygen (OL), lowering the energy barrier for OL&#9472;OH coupling to form OOH, the key intermediate for high current densities. The catalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low potential of 1.46&#160;V versus RHE in furfural oxidation, with exceptional selectivity (99.4%) and Faradaic efficiency (97.7%) for furoic acid. When deployed as anode in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane reactor, the NiMoCe/NF catalyst sustains a current density of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.85 and 2.15&#160;V, respectively, surpassing most reported continuous flow electrolyzers limited to 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the system exhibits outstanding durability after 200&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides critical insights into the rational design of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization coupled with industrial hydrogen production.

         <title>A Joyful Journey: Tungsten(VI) and Tungsten(V) Fluorides Meet N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tungsten(VI) fluoride complexes coordinated with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes were synthesized and characterized. Reduction of these seven&#8208;coordinated complexes afforded rare octahedral tungsten(V) fluoride complexes, a dinuclear fluoride&#8208;bridged complex (cAACMe), or a seven&#8208;coordinated (cAACMe) bis&#8208;carbene complex. These d0 tungsten complexes and metal&#8208;centered d&#185; radicals expand the scope of tungsten halide chemistry and are convenient entries into tungsten fluoride chemistry in simple organic solvents.








Abstract
The first complexation of tungsten(VI) fluoride with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (cAACMe) is reported, which led to formation of the complexes [(NHC)WF6] (NHC&#160;=&#160;IiPrMe, 1; BIiPr, 2; IMes, 3; IDipp, 4; and SIDipp, 5) and [(cAACMe)WF6] 6. Solid&#8208;state structural analysis revealed distorted mono&#8208;capped trigonal prismatic geometries for 2 and 3, whereas 6 adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. Reduction of 1&#8211;6 with 0.5 equivalents of TMS&#8208;pyrMe&#8208;TMS afforded rare tungsten(V) fluoride complexes [(NHC)WF5] (NHC&#160;=&#160;IiPrMe, 7; BIiPr, 8; IMes, 9; IDipp, 10; and SIDipp, 11). Reduction of 6 with TMS&#8208;pyr&#8208;TMS yielded the dinuclear, fluoride&#8208;bridged complex [(cAACMe)WF5]2 12. Subsequent addition of a second equivalent cAACMe to 12 gave the mononuclear, seven&#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;carbene complex [(cAACMe)2WF5] 13. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR spectroscopy confirm a predominantly metal&#8208;centered d&#185; radical in both 12 and 13. These findings expand the scope of tungsten fluoride chemistry by providing rare examples of tungsten(VI) and tungsten(V) complexes stabilized by soft carbon&#8208;donor ligands, paving the way for further exploration.

         <title>Bioinspired Cationic Antimicrobial Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review about membrane active cationic polymers with antimicrobial properties. A focus is laid on polymeric architecture, stimuli&#8208;responsive antimicrobial polymers, as well as synergistic effects of polymers, and other compounds. 








Abstract
Antibiotics are an essential tool of modern medicine, which is critically endangered by the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Without effective antibiotics, a number of medical advancements from the last century are in jeopardy, threatening our global public health and leading to a high death toll. To counteract this development, new therapeutic strategies, that are insusceptible to resistance development have to be established. Among them, antimicrobial polymers (AP)s are a promising class of materials. Their mode&#8208;of&#8208;action is highly unspecific as they kill bacteria by membrane permeabilization or precipitation of intracellular components. As such, it is unlikely for APs to be affected by AMR. This review highlights recent advances in AP design and understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of these cationic macromolecules. One spotlight is on the polymeric architecture and how it influences AP bioactivity. A second highlight is stimuli&#8208;responsive APs and their potential to increase AP selectivity. Moreover, synergistic effects, e.g., between polymer and antibiotics are reviewed. The last focus is on in vivo applications of APs, which could pave a way toward clinical applications.

         <title>Evoking Simultaneous Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by a Dual&#8208;Locked Platinum (IV) Prodrug for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug combines a TLR7/8 agonist (IMDQ) with a GGT&#8208;responsive moiety. Reduction to Pt(II) triggers GGT&#8208;mediated cleavage of axial ligands, releasing IMDQ to activate immunity. TLR7/8 signaling boosts T&#8208;cell infiltration into tumors and stimulates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs). Synergy between platinum chemotherapy and immune activation achieves potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
While platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, their clinical potential is limited by off&#8208;target toxicity and restricted antitumor mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug designed for tumor&#8208;specific activation, combining platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy with TLR7/8&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. The prodrug features a &#947;&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;caged TLR7/8 agonist as an axial ligand, enabling sequential activation by elevated glutathione (GSH) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the tumor microenvironment. Reduction of the Pt(IV) core releases cisplatin and depletes intracellular reductants, amplifying reactive oxygen species to trigger synergistic ferroptosis and apoptosis. Concurrently, GGT&#8208;cleaved axial ligand activates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells, repolarizing immunosuppressive M2&#8208;like macrophages to pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like phenotypes while recruiting effector and memory T cells. In murine models, the Pt(IV) prodrug demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy by confining immune activation to malignant tissues, eradicating primary tumors, and establishing durable protective immunity against recurrence. This spatiotemporally controlled dual&#8208;release strategy minimizes systemic toxicity while synergizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, offering a transformative approach for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Decoupled MOF Breathing: Pressure&#8208;Induced Reversal of Correlation Between Orthogonal Motions in a Diamondoid Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62 exhibits &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions affecting the cross&#8208;section and length of its 1D pores. Application of pressure reveals that the two motions can be switched between positive correlation and negative correlation, demonstrating decoupling of these motions within the 3D framework and providing a platform for design of more complex dynamic responsive materials.








Abstract
Responsive porous materials can outperform more rigid analogues in applications requiring precise triggering of molecular uptake/release, switching or gradual change in properties. We have uncovered an unprecedented dynamic response in the diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62, (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] (BDC&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), by using pressure as a stimulus. SHF&#8208;62 exhibits two distinct framework &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions involving changes in 1) cross&#8208;section and 2) length of its 1D pores. Our study using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in sapphire&#8208;capillary (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.15&#160;GPa) and diamond&#8208;anvil (0.15&#160;&lt;&#160;p &lt; 5&#160;GPa) cells reveals that different pressure regimes trigger positive and negative correlation between these two motions, requiring an unprecedented mechanical decoupling. Specifically, the DMF&#8208;solvated framework SHF&#8208;62&#8208;DMF, in DMF as pressure&#8208;transmitting medium, undergoes initial hyperexpansion of pore cross&#8208;section (p&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa), due to DMF ingress, followed by reversal/reduction at p&#160;&gt;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa while pore length contracts for all pressure increases, revealing decoupling of the two framework deformations. By contrast, nonpenetrating medium FC&#8208;70 imposes correlated compression (p&#160;&lt;&#160;1.4&#160;GPa) of pore cross&#8208;section and length, resembling framework activation/desolvation motions but of greater magnitude. Similar behavior occurs for SHF&#8208;62&#8208;CHCl3 in CHCl3 (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.14&#160;GPa), suggesting minimal ingress of CHCl3. These findings change our understanding of MOF dynamic responses and provide a platform for future responsive materials development.

         <title>Programming One&#8208;Dimensional Open&#8208;Channel Superlattices with Edge&#8208;Bonding of Meta&#8208;DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning the rigidity and length of DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNAs, we demonstrate a universal strategy for designing 1D porous crystals with tailored geometries and topologies, enabling advanced catalytic applications.








Abstract
The physicochemical properties of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) porous nanomaterials are fundamentally influenced by their channel geometrical and topological characteristics. However, synthesis of geometrically and topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous&#8208;to&#8208;macroporous range remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a universal strategy for constructing 1D open&#8208;channel superlattices through edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly (edge&#8208;bonding) of DNA&#8208;sparsely modified meta&#8208;DNA (M&#8208;DNA). By programming the rigidity and length of sparsely distributed DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNA surfaces, we achieved long&#8208;range ordered assembly of triangular M&#8208;DNA 1D single&#8208;channel superlattice (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;&#181;m) with a macroporous structure. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by assembling hexagonal M&#8208;DNA into 1D multi&#8208;channel superlattice (3.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.0&#160;&#181;m) with a mesoporous structure, thereby reducing the pore size from 140 to 29&#160;nm and the porosity from &#8764;94.2 to &#8764;87.5%. Furthermore, an ultrathin gold layer grown on the triangular M&#8208;DNA superlattice exhibited a &#8764;3.3&#8208;fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity compared to non&#8208;assembled triangular M&#8208;DNA, attributed to the increased surface area and narrower bandgap. This work broadens the design framework for porous crystals assembled via DNA nanotechnology and highlights their potential applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and beyond.

         <title>Exploring the Interplay of Lattice Dynamics and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Progress Towards Rational Phonon Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential in flexible, lightweight, and cost&#8208;effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure &#8208;&#8208; termed dynamic disorder &#8208;&#8208; that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low&#8208;frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad phonon spectrum drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance.&#160;In this review, we explore progress towards uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally&#8208;activated phonons.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential in flexible, lightweight, and cost-effective electronic devices. Despite their promise, the assembly of organic molecules into the condensed phase promotes a diverse set of lattice dynamics that introduce a detrimental modulation in the intermolecular electronic structure -- termed dynamic disorder -- that results in charge carrier mobilities that are orders of magnitude lower than inorganic semiconductors. This dynamic disorder is generally associated with low-frequency phonons, yet whether a small subset of modes or a broad phonon spectrum drives dynamic disorder remains contested. Resolving this debate is critical for defining how targeted phonon engineering could practically improve OSC performance.&#160;In this review, we explore progress towards uncovering the interplay between lattice dynamics and charge transport in OSCs, focusing on the critical role of thermally-activated phonons. We describe the powerful insight that mode-resolved analyses of electron-phonon interactions lends towards the rational design of new materials. We highlight recent efforts to achieve this, showcasing proposed strategies to mitigate dynamic disorder through molecular and crystal design. This work offers an overview of the insight gained towards understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing charge transport in OSCs,&#160;outlining pathways for enhancing performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Photometallobiocatalysis: Nonheme Fe&#8208;Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent RadicalDecarboxylative Azidation, Thiocyanation and Isocyanation of Redox&#8208;Active Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative catalysis with an enzyme and a smallmolecule photocatalyst has very recently emerged as a potentially general activation mode to advance novel biocatalytic reactions with synthetic utility. Herein, we report cooperative photobiocatalysis involving an engineered nonheme Fe enzyme and a tailored photoredox catalyst as a unifying strategy for the catalytic enantioconvergent decarboxylative azidation, thiocyanation and isocyanation of redox&#8208;active esters via a radical mechanism. Through the survey and directed evolution of nonheme Fe enzymes, we repurposed and further evolved metapyrocatechase (MPC), a nonheme Fe extradiol dioxygenase not previously studied in new&#8208;tonature biocatalysis, for the enantioselective C&#8211;N3, C&#8211;SCN and C&#8211; NCO bond formation through a radical rebound mechanism with an enzymatic Fe&#8211;X intermediate (X = N3, NCS, and NCO). A range of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radical precursors were effectively converted by our engineered MPC, allowing the syntheses of organic azides, thiocyanates and isocyanates with good to excellent enantiocontrol. Further chemical derivatization of these products furnished valuable compounds. Computational studies via DFT and MD simulations shed light on the mechanism as well as the binding poses of the alkyl radical intermediate in the enzyme active site and the &#960;&#8208;facial selectivity in the enantiodetermining radical rebound.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of First Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer of Water Oxidation at the BiVO4&#8208;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the BiVO4&#8208;water interface is considered to be the bottleneck of the overall water splitting at this aqueous interface. To provide&#160; insight into the mechanism of this reaction, we focus on the first proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). We obtain the free&#8208;energy surface of this first step by combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly probability enhanced sampling and machine learning potentials at the hybrid functional level of accuracy. Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent
with kinetic&#8208;isotope&#8208;effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to 0.66&#177;0.09&#160;eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom. The presented framework can be generally applied to other PCET steps and other oxides, thus opening the door to a comprehensive investigation of the OER mechanism at oxide&#8208;water interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Engineering for Achieving Full&#8208;Color Tunable Emission from Blue to Red and Multi&#8208;Level Information Security in Isomeric Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of novel hybrid metal halides polymorphs with full&#8208;color tunable emission are critical for the advancement of solid&#8208;state lighting and displays technologies. However, it remains challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we successfully synthesized three new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid isomeric copper (I) halides, namely &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 (where BuPh3P+ = butyltriphenylphosphonium, C22H24P+), featuring the same edge&#8208;sharing [Cu2I4]2&#8722; units. Notably, the monoclinic &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4, both belonging to the P21/n space group, exhibit bright blue and orange emission, respectively. The orthorhombic&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 with space group Pbca and larger lattice volume shows vivid red emission, thus achieving tunable full&#8208;color emission wavelength spanning from blue (445 nm) to red (667 nm), representing the first instance of such broad tunability through adjusting the spatial arrangement of the organic and inorganic parts. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 undergoes a reversible photo&#8208;induced fluorochromism, transitioning from blue to green. Furthermore, a reversible phase transformation between &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 can be triggered by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. As such, a photo&#8208;responsive switchable system and multistage information encryption/decryption system are successfully devised through leveraging unique multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitramine Formation via a Cryptic Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetase&#8208;Dependent Strategy in N&#8208;Nitroglycine Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N

nitroglycine (NNG), a rare nitramine natural compound, is the only known example produced by streptomyces strains. In this study, we clarified that NNG biosynthesis originates from glycine and l&#8208;lysine and elucidated its biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) nng. This cluster shares high homology with the recently reported BGCs of diazo compound azaserine. In vivo and in vitro results have indicated NNG biosynthetic pathway involves hydrazine and hydrazone generation, with a non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenase and a cytochrome P450 responsible for forming the nitramine structure. Furthermore, although NNG lacks a serine unit in the structure, its biosynthesis still requires the incorporation of a serine attached to the hydrazone intermediate by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), similar to the azaserine pathway, and two hydrolases are putatively involved in thioester hydrolysis and serine removal, respectively. This study, along with comparisons to azaserine biosynthesis, not only paves the way for the discovery of new nitramine and diazo compounds by genome mining but also highlights the potential for uncovering novel enzymes and chemistry involved in hydrazone oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Alcohols Enabled by Photocatalytic Radical Brook Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While radical Brook rearrangement has emerged as a powerful strategy in modern organic synthesis, enantioselective cross coupling involving radical Brook rearrangement&#160;remains unexplored. Herein, we report a photocatalytic radical Brook rearrangement followed by cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides, enabling the enantioconvergent construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. Key to this transformation is a radical relay process involving sequential generation of aryl cation radicals, alkoxy radicals, and carbon&#8208;centered radicals through Brook rearrangement. The reaction exhibits exceptional scope (&gt;40 examples), outstanding enantiocontrol (up to 99% ee), and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through formal syntheses of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031, along with diverse downstream derivatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Nanopipette Sensor for Electrochemical Interferent Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;based sensors have been widely utilized for their superior selectivity. However, they cannot distinguish the same kind of redox mediators from different sources. Typically, both the H&#8322;O&#8322; produced in glucose (analyte) oxidation by glucose oxidase (GOD) and the endogenous H&#8322;O&#8322; (interferent) existing in the detection system can be simultaneously measured, causing inaccurate results in glucose detection. To address this long&#8208;standing and inevitable obstacle, we proposed a new sensor design strategy, a dual&#8208;interface nanopipette sensor (DINS), to shield against the interferent electrochemically. The DINS comprised an anti&#8208;interference interface at the orifice of the nanopipette, and a sensing interface located at the inner wall with a certain distance from the orifice. Anti&#8208;interference interface, functioning as an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;, electrochemically eliminated the interferents with high efficiency while allowed the target species to pass through and be detected at the sensing interface. With the synergy of these two independent interfaces, the GOD&#8208;modified DINS (GOD&#8208;DINS) allowed the accurate detection of intracellular glucose with effectively eliminating endogenous H&#8322;O&#8322;, facilitating the quantitative study on the glucose metabolism inside single cells. Furthermore, this DINS configuration is expected to accurately quantify more substances, and reveal complex crosstalk interactions between multiple species in the physiological, pathological and pharmacological research.</dc:description>

The DINS comprised an anti-interference interface at the orifice of the nanopipette, and a sensing interface located at the inner wall with a certain distance from the orifice. Anti-interference interface, functioning as an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;, electrochemically eliminated the interferents with high efficiency while allowed the target species to pass through and be detected at the sensing interface. With the synergy of these two independent interfaces, the GOD-modified DINS (GOD-DINS) allowed the accurate detection of intracellular glucose with effectively eliminating endogenous H&#8322;O&#8322;, facilitating the quantitative study on the glucose metabolism inside single cells. Furthermore, this DINS configuration is expected to accurately quantify more substances, and reveal complex crosstalk interactions between multiple species in the physiological, pathological and pharmacological research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Multipath Proton Transmembrane Transport System with Redox&#8208;Switchable Characteristics for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins (NCPs) enable efficient and selective transport of specific species across cellular membranes and exhibit stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors; however, replicating these features in their artificial counterparts poses significant challenges. Here we report a hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;derived biomimetic multipath proton transport system, H3, by a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; cationic polymerization of 3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;oxetane. H3 efficiently transports protons while rejecting other ions and water molecules by forming multiple hydrogen bonding chains like natural proton channels. Patch clamp experiments revealed that H3 facilitates rapid proton transport (&#947;H+ = 181 &#177; 4 pS) comparable to that of natural gramicidin A (&#947;H+ = &#160;213 &#177; 4 pS) and demonstrates high H+&#8208;selectivity, with PH+/PK+, PH+/PNa+, and PH+/PCl&#8208; values reaching 78.4, 233.2, and 167.8, respectively. H3&#8208;induced proton transport causes elevated lysosomal pH and mitochondrial damage, ultimately resulting in severe cancer cell apoptosis (IC50: 0.23 &#956;M for U87MG; 1.04 &#956;M for B16F10). Interestingly, selenide moieties&#8208;containing H3&#8208;Se exhibits an unprecedented in situ redox&#8208;switchable &#8220;ON&#8208;OFF&#8221; of proton transport by regulating its hydrophilicity. This work will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of NCPs and treatments for cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Lattice&#8208;Coherent Surface Enabling Superior Mechanical Integrity for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode is pushing LiCoO2 towards 4.6 V operation. However, the structural and interfacial instability of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is exacerbated when the charging cut&#8208;off voltage exceeds 4.55 V, resulting in severe mechanical failure and subsequent dramatic capacity decay. Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co&#8208;containing Li&#8208;rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice&#8208;coherent Li&#8208;rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li&#8208;rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6 V and even at 4.7 V. This work taps into a new avenue of surface engineering on high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric B&#8592;N Functionalized Benzothiadiazoles for High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B&#8592;N containing polymers have emerged in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties. Despite these advantages, the development of B&#8592;N&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers for high&#8208;performance organic transistors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective B&#8592;N containing acceptor units. In this work, we address this challenge through the rational design and synthesis of two asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives, BTBN and FBTBN. These compounds leverage the unique electronic properties of the B&#8592;N motif, enabling the development of two new n&#8208;type polymers, PBTBN and PFBTBN. Notably, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBTBN and PFBTBN are significantly lowered by 0.2~0.3 eV compared to their counterparts without B&#8592;N functionalization, with PFBTBN achieving a LUMO of ~ &#8211;4.0 eV. Importantly, PFBTBN exhibits exceptional unipolar n&#8208;type transistor performance with a high electron mobility (&#956;e) of 3.85 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N molecular backbone not only stabilizes the electronic structure but also induces a near&#8208;amorphous morphology, thereby enabling PFBTBN&#8208;based flexible transistors to retain a high &#956;e of 3.16 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 even after 1000 bending cycles. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of incorporating asymmetric B&#8592;N functionalized acceptors for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Work Function&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Entropy Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Highly Stable Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is a key issue limiting the practical application of potassium metal batteries. Herein, a novel high&#8208;entropy SEI layer rich in inorganic components is designed and constructed via in situ electrochemical conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer on a porous scaffold. Theoretical studies and experimental techniques reveal that the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 heterostructure, with its low work function and weak Sn&#8722;O/S bond, significantly enhances reactivity with the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the in situ formation of the high&#8208;entropy SEI layer. The in situ generated high&#8208;entropy SEI exhibits low surface roughness, low surface potential, fast potassium ion transport characteristics, and excellent mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 20.08 GPa). Leveraging these advantageous properties of the high&#8208;entropy SEI, the resulting potassium metal anode achieves an excellent rate performance up to 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells and demonstrates outstanding cycling stability for 2500 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. When paired with a perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode, the potassium metal full battery retains 81.6% of its capacity over 1650 cycles at 10 C. This work underscores a straightforward and effective approach for the establishment of a stable interphase on metallic potassium anodes.</dc:description>

However, challenges from lacking&#160;matched industrial&#160;equipment&#160;and maintaining catalytic performance during&#160;scaling up impede&#160;the engineering of&#160;piezo&#8208;catalysis.

A&#160;scaling up test&#160;with 20 L seawater was conducted, yielding a H2&#160;production rate of 0.73 L/h&#160;which just occupying 0.7 m2. This performance (1.04 L/h/m2) exceeding the large&#8208;scale&#160;photocatalytic pure water H2&#160;production by&#160;panel reactor&#160;array&#160;(0.18~0.25 L/h/m2) reported in 2021[1]. Additionally, the H2&#160;evolution&#160;activity of the 20 L system showed no obvious decline compared with&#160;the 50 mL system&#160;before scaled&#8208;up, owing to the utilization&#160;of ternary piezo&#8208;catalysts&#160;system, which&#160;capitalized on the synergistic coupling effect of kinetics&#160;and thermodynamics.

         <title>Hydroxyl Spillover Activated from the Strongly Coupled Ru@Mn3O4 Heterostructure to Promote Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH* desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH* desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn3O4, in which Ru clusters&#160;are decorated on Mn3O4 via Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn3O4 facilitates the water dissociation, while the formed hetero&#8208;interface can efficiently desorb OH* via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn3O4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8211;1, surpassing recently reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn3O4 increase about 11 and 8&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect, and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Completing the Biosynthesis of the Clinically Important Diterpenoid Andrographolide in Andrographis paniculata</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Andrographolide is a prominent labdane diterpenoid extracted from Andrographis paniculata, celebrated for its exceptional anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide referring to ent&#8208;copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes approach, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of ent&#8208;copalol to 19&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ent&#8208;copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin. Then ApCYP706U5 accomplishes the third step by mediating the C&#8208;3 hydroxylation reaction, thereby allowing the formation of 14&#8208;deoxyandrographolide. Ultimately, ApCYP72F1 completes the biosynthetic generation of andrographolide with C&#8208;14 hydroxylation of the lactone and rearrangement of the olefin bond. In addition, co&#8208;expression of the minimal gene set in N. benthamiana engineered to produce ent&#8208;copalol feasibly produces andrographolide, thus establishing an innovative metabolic engineering strategy to produce this medicine of historical importance, circumventing the need for plant extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Mediators for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Element&#160;&#8211;&#160;Carbon Bond Homolysis in Main Group Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinitiated homolysis of element&#8208;carbon bonds is an important method for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals in catalysis and organometallic or polymer chemistry. In this respect, the use of earth&#8208;abundant main group elements such as aluminum or silicon is attractive. Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox&#8208;inactive elements are unstable and within their high&#8208;valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#8211;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#8211;C homolysis usually requires short&#8208;wave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#8211;C homolysis is possible when a redox non&#8208;innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the non&#8208;innocent ligands provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8208;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#8211;C bond. In this article, the effects of non&#8208;innocent ligands as mediators for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#8211;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Aziridination of Allylic Carbamates using Ion&#8208;Paired Rhodium Complexes and Extrapolation to C&#8208;H Amination of Phenethyl Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aziridination of alkenes is an important route to chiral nitrogen&#8208;containing building blocks. Here we report that carbamate&#8208;functionalized allylic alcohols undergo highly enantioselective aziridination using achiral dimeric Rh(II,II) complexes that are ion&#8208;paired with cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived chiral cations. The aziridine&#8208;containing products are amenable to a variety of further reactions to generate useful groupings of functionality. Furthermore, we show that the carbamate group is effective for directing highly enantioselective benzylic C&#8208;H amination when it is appended to phenethyl alcohols. Intermolecular C&#8208;H amination of phenethyl alcohol derivatives has proven highly challenging to achieve asymmetrically yet gives rise to valuable &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. Both processes result in rapid access to versatile, highly enantioenriched small molecule building blocks for synthesis and highlight the effectiveness and generality of this chiral cation&#8208;based strategy for asymmetric catalysis. We report studies that probe important structural features of the chiral cation and demonstrate that the ion&#8208;paired complexes can be formed from their individual components without a separate isolation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization of L&#8208;Cysteine in Heavy Water Induces Intrinsic Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing non&#8208;invasive techniques that can probe how solvents modulate the nucleation pathways of bioorganic molecules in solution remains an active and open area of research. Herein, we investigate the crystallization of the amino acid L&#8208;Cysteine and show that both the structure of the crystal and its intrinsic fluorescence can be drastically altered by solvent isotope effects. Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Structured Argyrodite&#8208;Type Electrolyte Enabling Elevated Chemical/Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate architecture integrating argyrodite core with LiCl shell was constructed by means of the specific surface engineering strategy, aiming to elevate all&#8208;round performances of sulfide solid electrolyte. Combined with the compatible electrolyte/electrode interface, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cell retains remarkable electrochemical performances. This surface engineering strategy paves the way towards an advanced and practical level in the field of sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolytes.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes hold great promise in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries owing to high ionic conductivity and good formability. However, their poor chemical/electrochemical stability imposes limitations on further large&#8208;scale application. In this study, a versatile solid electrolyte (SE) is finely crafted with the core of Cl&#8208;gradient argyrodite structure and the shell of LiCl layer. Leveraging LiCl shell as a &#8220;reservoir&#8221;, this argyrodite SE preserves the structure integrity and good Li+ conduction upon air exposure, exhibiting remarkable chemical stability. Moreover, Li+ transport from argyrodite bulk and grain boundary is synergistically enhanced through the specific surface engineering strategy, resulting in an exceptionally high ionic conductivity of 10.62&#160;mS cm&#8722;1. The LiCl shell, characterized by favorable electron shielding and lithiophobicity, enables the core&#8208;shell argyrodite with impressive electrochemical stability over a wide voltage range (0&#8211;5&#160;V versus Li/Li+) and good match for Li metal. As the electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility is optimized by engineering LiCl layer on SE, LiCoO2 cathode paired with the modified SE retains a remarkable capacity retention of 95.6% over 500 cycles at 1&#160;C.

The LiCl shell, characterized by favorable electron shielding and lithiophobicity, enables the core-shell argyrodite with impressive electrochemical stability over a wide voltage range (0&#8211;5&#160;V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and good match for Li metal. As the electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility is optimized by engineering LiCl layer on SE, LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode paired with the modified SE retains a remarkable capacity retention of 95.6% over 500 cycles at 1&#160;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Efficiency Through Precision Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8208;acceptor 3D COFs synthesized via Schiff base reactions were integrated into perovskite solar cells&#8217; SAMs. Their architecture enabled efficient charge separation, stable interfacial anchoring, and optimized energy alignment, enhancing hole transport and perovskite quality and reduced defect density. This achieving PCEs up to 25.20%, demonstrating COFs' potential in advancing PSC efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable 2D or 3D structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.

         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity Versus Surface Activity for Selective C&#9472;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 45 general descriptors was developed to capture the diverse structural features of a wide range of MOFs, enabling the study of MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for C&#9472;H borylation. This analysis revealed key factors that govern sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, allowing for the rational design of Ni catalysts with up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#9472;H borylation. By analyzing over 470&#160;000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#9472;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#9472;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.

         <title>Water Serving as Cocatalyst for the Highly Efficient Homogeneously Catalyzed Conversion of N2O/H2 Mixtures with Optimized Rhodium NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Feeling thirsty? A highly active rhodium olefin&#8211;amine carbene catalyst enables water&#8208;assisted, autocatalytic N&#8322;O hydrogenation. The increased &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC enhances the acidity of the cooperative ligand, improving catalytic efficiency. A unique dimeric [Rh]&#8322;[H&#8323;O&#8322;]&#8315; complex was identified, with structural analysis and DFT calculations revealing the efficient release of N&#8322; and water.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a valuable oxygen/nitrogen transfer reagent but reactions with N2O are challenging due to its inertness. Consequently, it accumulates in the atmosphere, and because it is both an ozone&#8208;depleting reagent and potent green&#8208;house gas, effective mitigation methods become important. This study presents rhodium(I) amido bis(olefin) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes [Rh(trop2N)(NHC)] as robust homogeneous catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of N2O. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations show that increasing &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC and the presence of water significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency. The rhodium&#8208;amido bond facilitates cooperative H2&#8208;cleavage and oxygen atom transfer from N2O. The catalyst is regenerated with the loss of water from the hydroxide intermediate [Rh(OH)(trop2NH)(NHC)], which forms a dimeric complex with a central bridging hydrated hydroxide ligand [H3O2]&#8722;. Water facilitates dinitrogen (N2) loss from an intermediate containing an oxy&#8208;diazene ligand [H&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;O]&#8722;. The optimized catalyst achieves a TON&#160;&gt;&#160;230&#160;000 and TOF&#160;&gt;&#160;1300 h&#8722;1.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular cage was designed to trap cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;, a highly unstable anion, through collective weak interactions, as reported by Ming Liu et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202501187). By intentionally avoiding strong interactions, the cage effectively preserved the aromaticity of cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;, while its decomposition was directly monitored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Dysprosium cyclopentadienide is a single&#8208;molecule magnet. Like other organometallic compounds, it is highly sensitive to moisture and oxygen. Encapsulating it in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes protects it from decomposition by environmental water or oxygen and maintains its magnetic character, as reported by Haitao Zhang, Yoji Horii, Masahiro Yamashita et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503979).

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Modulated High&#8208;Spin Localized Cobalt Sites Enhance Catalytic Ozonation for Efficient Odor Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic ozonation technology is crucial for environmental remediation due to its exceptional efficiency and capability for complete mineralization of organic pollutants. However, hindered by  spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, effective catalytic ozonation remains contingent upon the electronic properties and interfacial interactions of the catalyst. Recent studies identify interfacial atomic metal&#8208;oxygen species (M&#8208;*O) as a key descriptor in catalytic ozonation, determining the derivation of reactive species and subsequent reactivity. Herein, we modulated the high&#8208;spin localized Co active sites in HE&#8208;Co3O4 via a high&#8208;entropy strategy, which selectively stabilizes Co&#8208;*O surface species, thereby enhancing catalytic ozonation efficiency. HE&#8208;Co3O4 exhibits a 5&#8208;fold higher degradation rate than Co3O4 for 50 ppm CH3SH elimination (63&#8208;fold the mass activity compared to commercial MnO2) while maintaining exceptional stability over 24 h at 298 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetization hysteresis (M&#8208;H) measurements confirm the transition of Co3+ to high&#8208;spin states in HE&#8208;Co3O4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that unpaired electrons enhance the hybridization of Co 3d with O 2p orbitals, thereby establishing a Co&#8208;*O mediated interfacial pathway. This mechanism is directly observed through in situ Raman spectroscopy. These findings provide insights into the targeted modulation of catalyst electronic structures for ozone&#8208;catalyzed environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Control of Active Site Configurations in High&#8208;entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of five or more elements in similar proportions, exhibit unique physicochemical properties, but their disordered atomic structures pose challenges in the precise control of active sites. In contrast, high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEIs), with an ordered atomic arrangement and well&#8208;defined atomic positions, provide clear active site configurations, making them particularly advantageous for complex electrocatalytic reactions like the nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR). Herein, we present the FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI with precisely controlled elemental distributions, leading to the formation of distinct active sites. The FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI catalyst exhibits high activity for NITRR, achieving a high NH3 yield rate of 7.5 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.4 V and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.6% at &#8208;0.30 V, along with excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that Co sites act as key active sites, while Fe and Ni atoms contribute a synergistic effect. Additionally, the FeCoNiGeSb&#8208;HEI catalyst functions in a bifunctional system coupling NH3 production with the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), achieving an NH3 yield of 9.8 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at 1.8 V, maintaining stable performance for 100 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Nano to Micron: Architectural Engineering of Supramolecular Bottlebrushes for Extensively Tunable Structures and Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer greater architectural adaptability than covalent BBCPs. However, the dynamic nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions hinders precise control over their chain architecture, resulting in poorly controlled self&#8208;assembly, unpredictable morphologies, and limited utility. Herein, we introduce a novel molecular design for amphiphilic supramolecular BBCPs that overcomes key challenges in the field. The resulting materials exhibit superior thermodynamic stability in weakly polar solvents. This enables the first demonstration of well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular surfactants within a complex emulsion system, leading to the formation of photonic supraballs with homogenous porous structures. Critically, precise chain architectural engineering enables pore diameter tuning over an unprecedented nanometer&#8208;to&#8208;micrometer range (67 nm&#8208;1.92 &#181;m), significantly surpassing the maximum domain sizes achievable with self&#8208;assembled covalent BBCPs. This extends the photonic bandgap into the mid&#8208;wave infrared range, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials with potential applications in thermal management.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Uniform Phase Structure for Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Processed Binary Organic Solar Cells with 20.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition has become a facile and promising method to fabricate highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). However, characterization and optimization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) morphology remain a grand challenge for LBL&#8208;processed active layer, and their correlation with photovoltaic properties of OSC devices is not clear to date. Here, to address this issue, the morphology and its formation mechanisms of LBL processed active layer based on the classical D18/L8&#8208;BO blend were investigated systematically. Intriguingly, a unique 3D nanomorphology is achieved and uncovered within the LBL processed active layer, which highlights a highly uniform and &#8220;zigzag&#8221;&#8208;shaped phase structure formed by the intersecting of donor and acceptor aggregates along horizontal direction in the middle&#8208;depth layer, rarely found in BHJ films processed by blend casting. Our results revealed that solid additive DBM with a twisted conformation plays a crucial role in achieving the uniform phase structure of LBL&#8208;deposited active layer. Consequently, the characteristic 3D morphology of LBL processed device significantly improves short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, enabling an impressive PCE of 20.2% in such binary device. Therefore, this work unambiguously demonstrates a unique 3D nanomorphology within LBL active layer, unveils the morphology manipulation mechanism and their correlation with optoelectronic properties of OSCs</dc:description>

         <title>2D/2D MOF/MXene Schottky Junction: Prolonged Carrier Lifetime and Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing sunlight for photocatalytic overall water splitting offers a sustainable approach to renewable hydrogen production, addressing global energy and environmental challenges. However, the development of efficient and durable photocatalysts remains a significant obstacle. This study introduces the design and performance of a 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction composed of Cu2[CuTCPP] MOF of nanometric size and exfoliated Ti3C2 MXene for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting. By leveraging the extensive interfacial contact between the two components, an interfacial electric field is generated, promoting efficient charge migration and prolonging carrier lifetimes, as confirmed through systematic density functional theory simulations, in situ irradiation X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Ti3C2 MXene, acting as a cocatalyst for photohole transport and accumulation, reduces oxidative degradation and slows catalyst deactivation. The synergistically enhanced light absorption properties of the Cu2[CuTCPP]/Ti3C2 heterojunction result in an impressive H2 evolution rate exceeding 5000 &#956;mol gcat&#8722;1, underscoring its potential for next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems in renewable energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Regiodivergent Reductive Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Coupling by Nickel Catalysis: Sorting Different Alkyl&#8208;Nickel Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective and divergent functionalizations on saturated alkyl chain at specific unfunctionalized positions is a key challenge in organic chemistry and other related areas and offers unprecedented synthetic opportunities. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective and divergent alkyl&#8208;alkyl reductive coupling between two different alkyl halides has been developed. Notably, the reaction finely tunes and recognizes thermodynamic favored &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals over &#946;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, and distal ipso&#8208;alkyl radicals to deliver chemo&#8208; and position&#8208;selective alkylation of unactivated &#945;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;H of amines under reductive conditions. Moreover, the reaction selectively functionalizes one alkyl chain over two migratable alkyl chains. By just switching the catalytic parameters, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of saturated C&#8208;H bonds, and ipso&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling allow for rapid access to three types of branched aliphatic amine architectures from identical starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking as Electron&#8208;Transfer Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis provides a promising approach to produce green energy, by which the intermittent solar energy can be converted into storable chemical energy. Well&#8208;known that the electron transfer rate has great influence on the photocatalytic efficiency. Revealing the influence of electron transfer rate on the photocatalytic efficiency from a molecular level is of great significance but challenge. Herein, we give solid evidence to show that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking can serve as an electron transfer channel to boost photocatalysis. Specifically, two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with similar structures but slightly different intermolecular interactions have been weaved. Interestingly, the HOF with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions shows much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution than the one without. Further structural and spectroscopic analyses revealed that the much&#8208;enhanced photocatalytic activity of the former can be attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which can really serve as an electron transfer channel, thus accelerating the electron transfer and achieving a remarkably enhanced activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The work, from a molecular level, reveals the role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in photocatalysis and gives new insights into the electron transfer in photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Self&#8208;healing Protective Layer Enabling Stable Zinc Ion Batteries Through Strong Zn&#8208;S Affinity and Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely regarded as the ideal candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, Zn metal anode has long faced challenges, such as: hydrogen evolution reaction, dendrite growth, surface corrosion. Herein, we report the development of a self&#8208;healable and strongly adhesive polymer protective layer for AZIBs, which is achieved by polymerizing a natural small molecule, thioctic acid (TA) on Zn surface. Thanks to the strong and spontaneous affinity between Zn metal surface and S atoms on polymer chains, this polymer protective layer can firmly and dynamically adhere to the Zn surface. Thus, even at a thickness of only &lt;1 &#956;m, the protective layer can exhibit a strong adhesion force of up to 10.5 N with Zn surface, while the abundant carboxyl groups in protective layer can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, endowing its high self&#8208;healing property and enhancing its strength. Such a protective layer&#160;effectively inhibits the dendrite growth physically,&#160;regulates the Zn2+ migration and deposition behavior chemically. Therefore, the symmetric cells can be cycled for ~1000 h at the current density of 1.0 mA cm&#8208;2 and 5.0 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. The full cells with NH4V4O10 can also run stably for 1000 cycles with a high capacity retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polyanions as Effective Interphase Layers for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) driven by host&#8208;guest interactions have seen considerable advancements over the past decade, but the guest species involved are predominantly neutral molecules or cations. Strong and dependable macrocycle&#8208;anion interactions for supramolecular polymerization are highly sought after, yet the functionalities of this class of SPs featuring negatively charged backbones remain largely unexplored. Here we report a novel host&#8208;guest interaction between one tetraurea macrocycle and two organophosphate anions with high affinity (association constant Ka = 1.06 &#215; 109 M&#8722;2). It can serve as noncovalent joints to efficiently link low&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass polyethylene oxide (PEO) diorganophosphates into long linear SPs. Being used as an interphase layer in anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries, the polymer material promotes Li+ absorption and desolvation through electrostatic attractions, and enables fast Li+ transport by the alternatingly arranged anionic linkages and PEO units in the polymer main chain. As a result, the SP layer homogenizes Li+ flux to achieve uniform Li deposition, and significantly improves the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 full batteries by a factor of 285% with cycling stability over 200 cycles. These findings pave the way for a new family of anion&#8208;based SPs with tunable architectures and compositions, and suggest their promising applications in future batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright and Fast&#8208;response Hybrid X&#8208;ray Scintillators by Molecular and Dielectric Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators featuring bright and fast&#8208;response properties are essential for high&#8208;speed and dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging. Nevertheless, simultaneously possessing high light yields and fast response remains a significant challenge for most scintillators. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve the bright and fast&#8208;response characteristics of scintillators by leveraging the combined effects of dielectric and molecular confinement in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators (TPA)2MnBr4. Thereinto, large tetrapropylammonium cations (TPA+) surround [MnBr4]2&#8722; units, forming a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) molecular confinement structure that promotes electron localization and achieves a notable light yield of 56800 photons MeV&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the low dielectric constant of TPA+ can enhance dielectric confinement of [MnBr4]2&#8722; units, mitigating exciton capture by deep defects. These synergistic effects in the scintillators lead to a large exciton binding energy of 1028.8 meV and an ultrafast response time of 500 fs. Notably, under the irradiation of X&#8208;rays, (TPA)2MnBr4 exhibits an extremely low detection limit of 18.7 nGyair s&#8722;1 and an exceptional spatial resolution of 21.0 lp mm&#8722;1. Given the bright and fast&#8208;response features of scintillators, we demonstrate the potential applications in 3D dynamic and real&#8208;time X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings lay the groundwork for designing high&#8208;performance scintillators and open avenues for innovative applications in high&#8208;resolution and dynamic imaging</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis Accelerated by Overcoming Photo&#8208;Dember Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst (BOC(101)&#8208;OVs) of bismuth oxychloride with largely exposed (101) crystal plane and rich oxygen vacancies was synthesized, exhibiting a high NH3 yield after photocatalytic N2 reduction under solar light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to overcome confinement by the photo&#8208;Dember effect, leading to &gt;95% of photogenerated electrons changing their transfer path from (001) to (101) crystal plane. As a result, a new nitrogen reduction pathway with combined alternating hydrogenation and terminal hydrogenation is found, as reported by Wen Liu et&#160;al. (e202503097).

         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202506625), Chong&#8208;An Chen, Bingbing Zhang, Kang Min Ok, and co&#8208;workers report novel birefringent crystals featuring linear interhalogen birefringence&#8208;active groups, IX2&#8315; (X=Cl, Br). The compounds, [H&#8208;4AP][Icl2], [HDMA]2[ICl2]&#183;Cl, [H&#8208;4AP][IBr2], and [HDMA]2[IBr2]&#183;Br, exhibit giant birefringence in both the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions, while achieving an optimal balance between large birefringence and moderate bandgap.

         <title>Crystallization/Precipitation Driven Non&#8208;equilibrium Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Thiovalerolactone toward Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable Polythioester with Excellent Barrier Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers with comparable performances with commodity plastics remains as a challenge to establish a circular plastic economy. In this contribution, we propose a&#160;precipitation/crystallization driven non&#8208;equilibrium ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;thiovalerolactone (&#948;TVL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PTVL in the presence of a strong base/urea binary catalyst. The obtained PTVL exhibits good thermal and mechanical performances as well as superior barrier properties comparable with some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained PTVL can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a high yield and purity by distillation from a commodity plastic waste mixture without tedious separation, highlighting its great potential as a closed&#8208;loop recyclable packaging material.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient near infrared (NIR) luminescence is highly important for modern optoelectronic fields. In their Research Article (e202505322), Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers fabricated new types of NIR optical waveguides based on transparent rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses using a facile self&#8208;assembly process. This work provides a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence sensitized lanthanide strategy to synthesize molecular glasses with color&#8208;tunable NIR luminescence and extends the function of NIR optical waveguiding into advanced photonic communications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we present a novel intracellular strategy for the in situ synthesis of gold&#8211;polymer nanocomposites within living bacteria. By transforming Escherichia coli into active nanofactories via intracellular polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (iPISA), we achieved precise control over composite architecture. Our findings indicate that bacterial cells play an active role in constructing complex nanomaterials, offering new perspectives for the sustainable synthesis of nanocomposites and the integration of biological systems in materials fabrication.</dc:description>

Biarylsultams as self&#8208;synthesizing autophotocatalysts are represented as repeating tile patterns on mosaic lamps, with different coloured lamps representing different substituted biarylsultam derivatives. Reflecting the self&#8208;synthesizing library concept, the lamps are suspended within a library. On the spines of the books are imprinted the photocatalytic synthetic transformations exemplifying the reductive power of biarylsultam organophotocatalysts, as demonstrated by Joshua P.

         <title>Xanthopinacol Boronate: A Robust, Photochemically Assembled and Cleavable Boronic Ester for Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xanthopinacol (xpin) boronates are a conceptually new class of masked boronic acids designed to alleviate many of the disadvantages of pinacol esters and other popular adducts. They can be formed directly from xanthone and UV light, undergo orthogonal transformations, and are cleavable under photoredox catalysis or oxidative conditions that recycle xanthone to prevent the re&#8208;esterification and facilitate the isolation of the boronic acid.








Abstract
Organoboronic acids impact numerous fields of application from organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials science. However, their highly polar nature makes them challenging to handle, purify, and characterize. Boronic esters help overcome these issues, and pinacol esters (Bpin) have become the dominant boronic acid surrogate in organic synthesis. Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks. Its formation from pinacol is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by&#8208;product. Although other boronyl protecting groups exist, their removal requires harsh pH conditions. To address these issues, we developed xanthopinacol boronates (Bxpin), a robust protecting group for boronic acids with excellent orthogonality in various chemical reactions and mild irreversible removal under catalyzed photoredox conditions. Xpin boronates can be obtained directly by irradiation of a mixture of free boronic acid and xanthone with UV light, causing an in situ dimerization of xanthone to the required xanthopinacol. The unique attributes of xpin boronates were further studied by UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and various stability tests.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals how entropy regulates sulfur utilization and cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries. High&#8208;entropy (HES) catalysts enable optimized Zn&#8211;S redox pathways and structural integrity, achieving high sulfur utilization and stable cycling. In contrast, low&#8208; (LES) and medium&#8208;entropy (MES) catalysts show inefficient reactions with by&#8208;product formation and Mn/Co leaching, degrading performance. Practical validation demonstrates HES&#8208;based pouch cells maintain exceptional stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with merely 0.06% capacity decay per cycle, establishing entropy engineering as a practical design strategy. 








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8211;solid Zn&#8211;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional low&#8208;entropy catalysts suffer from poor stability, leading to leaching effects and water splitting during cycling. To overcome these limitations, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8211;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. In contrast, utilizing medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Consequently, the pouch cell with the HES catalysts delivers a high cathode energy density of 313&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Functional Polyacetals via Controlled Cascade Enyne Metathesis Polymerization: Tunable Degradability, Postpolymerization Modification, and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a versatile platform to access functional polyacetals from stereochemically defined monomers. The polymerization exhibited living character and broad functional group tolerance. Rational monomer design enabled tunable hydrolysis rate and photodegradability. Polymer structures were elaborated by postpolymerization modification, preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers and amphiphilic copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We present a versatile platform for the synthesis of functional polyacetals from sugar and furfuryl alcohol derivatives using controlled cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. A range of monomers with defined stereochemistry were explored that featured broad functional group tolerance. The polymerization showed living character and permitted preparation of functionalized polyacetals with targetable molecular weights and more complex architectures. In addition, by harnessing the chiral nature of starting materials, the method granted facile access to chiral polyacetals. Modulation of regiochemical and substituent factors around the acetal motif conferred tunable hydrolysis rate, as well as photodegradability when installed with an ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl group. The polymer structure was further elaborated by postpolymerization modification via leveraging the reactivity of suitable pendent groups and preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers via graft&#8208;through polymerization. Further utilities of the method were showcased by the preparation of amphiphilic copolymers with complete degradability that exhibited self&#8208;assembly behaviors through copolymerization.

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We controlled the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. High&#8208;quality FASnI2Br perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects, which resulted in an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000&#8197;lux.







Abstract
The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.

         <title>Diacylation of Peptides Enables the Construction of Functional Vesicles for Drug&#8208;Carrying Liposomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin&#8208;binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug&#8208;carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non&#8208;amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non&#8208;enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis. However, aqueous head group diacylation is challenging in the absence of enzymes. The use of charged peptides instead of canonical phospholipid head groups offers advantages with respect to ease of acylation and chemical diversity. Here we demonstrate that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables in situ synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized vesicles resembling cellular membranes. Diacylation occurs between non&#8208;amphiphilic peptides possessing an N&#8208;terminal cysteine, and acyl thioesters. Peptide head groups endow unique membrane functions, which is demonstrated by incorporation of an arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) motif, resulting in vesicle targeting to &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. The biocompatibility and functional group programmability of D&#8208;ALPs supports their broad utility as membrane mimetics.

&lt;p&gt;Membrane-forming phospholipids are generated in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here we show that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D-ALPs), which spontaneously self-assemble into micron-sized functional vesicles. The use of integrin-binding peptide motifs as head groups enables the construction of drug-carrying liposomes that are specifically taken up by cells.

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;Like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>

The integration of structural biology, genetics, biochemistry, and computational chemistry revealed a specific mechanism by which a CT domain with the &#8220;PW&#215;&#215;&#215;DG&#8221; motif stabilizes an amidate intermediate through a protonated arginine residue R2776 outside the motif to mediate nucleophilic attack. The findings expand knowledge of C domain functions in non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Pt&#8208;doped RuO2 was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for synthesis of GA and H2 fuels from PET wastes. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA and H2 yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1 and 2.38&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, using a membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8722;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8722;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09&#8197;A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.9&#8201;%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Acetaldehyde Production from CO2 and H2O via Synergistic Vacancies and Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of high bonding energy in photocatalytic CO2 conversion and the complexity and false positives in product detection associated with sacrificial agents, sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu are synergistically combined to enhance CO2 activation and lower the activation energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling on Cd0.6Zn0.4S, thereby achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents for CH3CHO production.







Abstract
Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO2 represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd0.6Zn0.4S (CZS) photocatalyst co&#8208;modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8722;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO2 and H+, thereby promoting CO2 conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C2 intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of ca. 80&#8201;% via photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO2 conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.

CH4 and N2 are abundant molecules in our solar system and are the primary constituents of Titan's atmosphere. Under extreme pressures and temperatures within a diamond anvil cell, CH4 and N2 are demonstrated to react to form a range of compounds, dependent on the conditions and initial concentrations. This provides valuable insight into the complexity of the C&#8722;N&#8722;H ternary system under planetary conditions.







Abstract
Carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are among the most abundant elements in the solar system, and our understanding of their interactions is fundamental to prebiotic chemistry. CH4 and N2 are the simplest archetypical molecules formed by these elements and are both markedly stable under extremes of pressure. Through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments supported by density functional theory calculations, we observe diverse compound formation and reactivity in the CH4&#8208;N2 binary system at high pressure. Above 7&#8197;GPa two concentration&#8208;dependent molecular compounds emerge, (CH4)5N2 and (CH4)7(N2)8, held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Strikingly, further compression at room temperature irreversibly breaks the N2 triple bond, inducing the dissociation of CH4 above 140&#8197;GPa, with the near&#8208;quenched samples revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of strong covalently bonded C&#8722;N&#8722;H networks. High temperatures vastly reduce the required pressure to promote the reactivity between CH4 and N2, with NH3 forming together with longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons at 14&#8197;GPa and 670&#8197;K, further decomposing into powdered diamond when temperatures exceed 1200&#8197;K. These results exemplify how pressure&#8208;driven chemistry can cause unexpected complexity in the most simple molecular precursors.

         <title>Multisite Cross&#8208;Linked Ligand Suppressing Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

A multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid molecules have been proposed to simultaneously passivate non&#8208;radiative defects and stabilize the surface of perovskite QDs, enabling efficient and stable green perovskite QLEDs with a peak EQE of over 25&#8201;% and an operating lifetime of more than 1300&#8197;h, among the highest for perovskite QLEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution&#8208;processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD&#8208;based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross&#8208;linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour&#8208;saturated green CsPbBr3&#8208;based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6&#8201;% together with an operational lifetime of 1340&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin is introduced to simultaneously boost the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Advanced characterization techniques have revealed that coumarin preserves the mechanical properties of the PEO framework, provides new Li+ hopping centers and constructs a Li2O&#8208;rich SEI layer with excellent Li+ transport dynamics, which are crucial for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO's crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Dual Breaking of Electron Cloud and Space Structure Symmetry Induced Microscopic Split&#8208;phase Interface for High&#8208;rate and Long&#8208;term Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to constrain H2O activity and accelerate Zn2+ migration, which remarkably solves the interfacial side reactions and uneven Zn deposition caused by unstable EDL, especially under fast mass&#8208;charge transfer at high&#8208;rate conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes and Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with excellent endurance.







Abstract
Weak dipole interactions between highly symmetric H2O molecules and SO42&#8722; species are the root cause of unstable electric double layer (EDL), which triggers the hydrogen evolution reaction and Zn dendrite formation, significantly impeding the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we designed a microscopic split&#8208;phase interface (MSPI) by dual breaking of electron cloud and space structure symmetry to suppress interfacial side reactions and achieve uniform Zn deposition. The structurally asymmetric methylurea (MU) molecules possess both hydrophobic methyl and hydrophilic amino groups, which disrupt the continuity of H&#8208;bonding network and the aggregation state of H2O molecules, resulting in peculiar nanoscale core&#8211;shell&#8208;like clusters. Such a unique structure further evolves into MSPI at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, ensuring a continuously stable EDL. The DRT analysis and MD simulation confirmed that MSPI structure is composed of the outer H2O layer and the inner MU layer, which greatly suppress the activity of H2O molecules and accelerate Zn2+ migration. Consequently, the formulated electrolyte exhibited remarkable cycle reversibility over 1500&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, achieving a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity of 30&#8197;Ah&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, its feasibility was demonstrated by coupling with the I2@AC cathode, achieving an impressive 28,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Coordination Topology Design in Anion&#8208;Rich Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolyte, the equal molar dual&#8208;anion strategy expands the solvation energy level distribution and boosts the Li&#8208;ion transport. Moreover, a universal principle is found based on the coordination topology of the dual&#8208;anion combination: only the combination containing anion with the multi&#8208;coordination site can raise the Li&#8208;ion transport in such systems, supporting the design of high&#8208;rate lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;rich solvated structures are promising for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their good interfacial compatibility. Nevertheless, limited Li&#8208;ion transport of these electrolytes has hindered their high&#8208;rate application. Here we demonstrate that Li&#8208;ion transport in anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolytes could be facilitated by designing the coordination topology of anions in the solvation structure. Results show that, for a binary&#8208;anion electrolyte, equal&#8208;molar anions show the most expanded energy level distribution of solvation structures, thus reducing the Li&#8208;ion transport energy barrier, and resulting in a Li&#8208;ion conductivity even higher than that of the commercial carbonate electrolyte at a temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. More importantly, we identify a universal principle governing the Li&#8208;ion transport enhancement driven by anion configurations: only the combination of anions with multi&#8208;coordination sites shows facilitation in Li&#8208;ion transport, while the combination of centrosymmetric anions with the mono&#8208;coordination site harms it. The diversified anion&#8208;rich solvated structures also form stable interphases on the electrodes, enabling long&#8208;term cycling of 4.5&#8197;V LMBs at a high current density of 3.78&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Overall, our findings shine new light on developing practical electrolytes for energy&#8208;dense LMBs.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Induced Electrochemical Ion&#8208;Solvent Cointercalation in Pillared Titanate Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;expansion of hydrogen tetratitanate is realized with organic pillars. Optimized atomistic configurations of the pillared materials are proposed by characterization with experiment and simulation. The nanoconfinement modification of HTO induces ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions with improved kinetics and increased storage capacity.







Abstract
Electrochemical ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions are an avenue to reach improved kinetics compared to the corresponding intercalation of desolvated ions. Here, we demonstrate the impact of different structural pillar molecules on the electrochemical Li+ intercalation mechanism in expanded hydrogen titanate (HTO) electrode materials. We show that interlayer&#8208;expansion of HTO with organic pillars can enable cointercalation reactions. Their electrochemical reversibility is drastically improved when non&#8208;cross&#8208;linking pillars are employed that expand and separate the host material's individual layers, underlining the impact of the electrochemo&#8208;mechanics of the nanoconfined interlayer space. This pillared HTO structure results in an increased Li+ storage capacity and reversibility compared to pristine HTO. We derive structural models of the pillared HTO host materials based on combined experiments and theoretical calculations, and employ electrochemical operando experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the nanoconfinement&#8208;induced cointercalation mechanism in pillared HTO electrode materials. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoconfined pillar molecules to modify host materials and enable highly reversible cointercalation reactions with improved capacity and kinetics.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polar&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silane protection strategy is developed to enable early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed efficient terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene and polar monomers. A series of polar functionalized polyolefin elastomers with high molecular weight and high 1&#8208;octene incorporation are successfully synthesized. This strategy shows comprehensive better performances than previously wide practiced aluminum protection strategy, leading to products with excellent mechanical and elastic properties, along with great practical applications.







Abstract
Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) are widely used for many applications including plastic toughening and encapsulating photovoltaic modules. The introduction of polar groups into POEs improves their compatibility and adhesion with polar components, but it is challenging to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polar&#8208;functionalized POEs (P&#8208;POEs) via copolymerization. Here, we report a silane protection strategy to enable the production of P&#8208;POEs (including an ethylene&#8208;based P&#8208;EPOE and a propylene&#8208;based P&#8208;PPOE) with widely tunable 1&#8208;octene incorporation ratios (7.4&#8211;19.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), appropriate polar monomer incorporation ratios (0.7&#8211;2.7 mol&#8201;%), melting points (63.8&#8211;99.8&#8201;&#176;C), and high molecular weights (up to 43.8&#215;104&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This approach involved the early transition metal&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum&#8208;based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P&#8208;POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high&#8208;performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.

The La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge was constructed and activated in the three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous La2O3&#8208;NiO, which acted as a kind of superior anode catalyst in urea electrooxidation and purification. 3DOM morphology increased the contact surface of the material with the solution and accelerates mass transfer.

Abstract
Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La&#8208;induced three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49&#8197;V @ 80&#8201;&#176;C) and 280&#8197;h stability test at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density (25&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV&#8208;vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&#948;+ (&#948;&#8805;3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR&#8208;IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.

         <title>An Adhesive Adaptation Layer Mitigates the Interfacial Instabilities of Rigid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical solid polymer electrolytes (H&#8208;SPEs) featuring an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) effectively mitigate interfacial instabilities in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries by reinforcing electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and promoting uniform lithium deposition. This novel architecture demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity retention over 960&#8197;cycles with high&#8208;loading NMC622 cathode.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely recognized as promising candidates for enabling solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with improved safety, high energy density, and extended cycling life. The traditional perspective posits that increasing the mechanical modulus of SPEs enhances their capacity to regulate Li0 deposition and suppress dendrite penetration. However, this study reveals a distinct failure mechanism: a rigid SPE with a high storage modulus suffers from delamination&#8208;induced cell failure due to its inability to accommodate the volumetric changes of the Li0 anode. To address these limitations, we developed a hierarchical SPE incorporating an adhesive adaptation layer (AAL) positioned between the Li0 anode and the rigid SPE. The AAL combines strong adhesive strength, effectively mitigating delamination, with flowability, allowing it to eliminate interfacial voids and defects. Structural characterization via Cryo&#8208;TEM and SEM demonstrates that this hierarchical design facilitates uniform, dense, and whisker&#8208;free Li0 deposition, in sharp contrast to the uneven and porous morphology observed with the rigid SPE alone. Furthermore, the enhanced interfacial stability promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;enriched SEI layer, contributing to long&#8208;term cycling stability. As a result, the H&#8208;SPE exhibits superior electrochemical performance, achieving 87&#8201;% capacity over 960 cycles when paired with high&#8208;loading (1.6&#8197;mAh/cm2) NMC622 cathode.

         <title>Enabling Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation Prior to Water Reduction in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Mild Protic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and introduces mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) for aqueous zinc batteries according to thermodynamics. MMI is reduced prior to water, forming an organic&#8208;dominated SEI that effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition. Hence, zinc anodes exhibited exceptional reversibility and cycle stability in electrolyte with 20&#8197;mM MMI.







Abstract
Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)2. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI&#8208;derived SEI exhibits a superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 13.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.

         <title>Preparation of Peapod&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Periodic Sequence via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Morphology Differentiation and Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel strategy for constructing peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence through fusion of vesicles and porous spheres. The generation and assembly of vesicles and porous spheres are achieved via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in one&#8208;pot. The aggregation unit numbers of peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers are affected by the length of solvophobic block and collision probability of vesicles and porous spheres.







Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles have so far dominated the field of nanoparticle assembly, and assembly of pure organic nanoparticles (such as block copolymer nanoparticles) has rarely been examined in colloidal systems. Expanding the scope of nanoparticles is of great significance for the study of nanoparticle assembly. Herein, a paradigm for the copolymerization of organic nanoparticles into peapod&#8208;like linear nanostructures with periodic sequence is introduced. Vesicles and porous spheres are generated in situ during polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and can be viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;). The subsequent copolymerization of these nanomers is completed in one&#8208;pot, which greatly simplifies the preparation of nanomers and peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers. It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on&#8208;demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano&#8208;object.

         <title>Chemocatalytic Cell Tagging Platform for Recording Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions via Engineered Palladium&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative chemocatalytic proximity labeling platform&#8208;Artificial Metalloenzyme Tagging Technology (ArM&#8208;Tag). The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a protein scaffold to catalyze a bioorthogonal O&#8208;deallylation reaction directly on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range.







Abstract
Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8722;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.

This study explores the catalytic role of water molecule and the inherent thermal radiation in gaseous homogeneous high&#8208;temperatue propane dehydrogenation, in which the water molecule could generate hydroxyl radicals with the help of thermal radiation and thus facilitate the reaction. Consequently, the proposed system could achieve a 37.93&#8201;% olefin yield and a 51.14&#8201;% single&#8208;pass propane conversion, and an excellent stability for over 2,000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8901; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93&#8201;%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14&#8201;%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven CuAAC Reaction Catalyzed by Photosensitive Biohybrids Energized by Lactate for Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system has been presented for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Powered by lactate, the biohybrid can trigger the CuAAC reaction to generate active drugs in situ through bacterial respiration. Of note, under illumination, the CuAAC reaction can be further accelerated.







Abstract
As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiS&#8208;induced free&#8208;electron reversal migration discharges dz2&#8208;orbital electrons of Au cocatalysts to reduce the antibonding occupancy of Au&#948;+&#8208;Oad bonds, thus improving O2 adsorption and stabilizing *OOH intermediates on NiS@Au cocatalysts to achieve highly selective H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82&#8197;&#956;mol/h/50&#8197;mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07&#8201;% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Evolution&#8208;Guided Discovery of Antimycobacterial Triculamin&#8208;Like Lasso Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hypothesized convergent biosynthesis of triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from different biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) types represented across multiple bacterial phyla. The elucidation of the triculamin non&#8208;canonical BGC and resistance mechanism by heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus and in&#8197;vitro acetylation with resistance conveying enzyme. Discovery and characterization of two triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from canonical lasso peptide BGCs.







Abstract
Triculamin is a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) lasso peptide with potent antimycobacterial activity, produced by an unusual, non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and N&#8208;acetyltransferase (triT). Through in&#8197;vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin&#8208;like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non&#8208;canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin&#8208;like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin&#8208;like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross&#8208;phylum distribution.

Quenching xenon's thirst by its coordination to water in the 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complexes, [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, provides the first examples of Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O bonded noble&#8208;gas hydrates. These complexes, along with (CH2CH2O)4XeO3, were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and computational studies that show the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts with the crown ethers and water molecules are &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.







Abstract
Following on our report of the first coordination complex between a noble&#8208;gas compound and a crown ether, (CH2CH2O)5XeO3, the reactions and structures of XeO3 complexes with 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 were investigated. The reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with XeO3 in dilute aqueous HF solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, whereas reactions of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with moist solid XeO3 in acetone solutions yielded (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O complexes are air&#8208;stable and shock&#8208;insensitive, whereas [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF is a treacherous, shock&#8208;sensitive detonator. Low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that XeO3 is coordinated to the crown ether and H2O through short Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;O contacts. Mappings of the XeO3 Hirshfeld surfaces onto 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in (CH2CH2O)4XeO3 and [(CH2CH2O)6(H2O)XeO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O reveal regions of negative electrostatic potential (EP) on the oxygen atoms of the crown ethers and regions of high positive EP on the Xe(VI) atom of XeO3 that are consistent with &#963;&#8208;hole bonds. The calculated gas&#8208;phase geometries, Wiberg bond valences and indices, and empirical bond valences corroborate the descriptions of the shortest Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;

         <title>Highly Strained Electron&#8208;Rich Molecular Bowl and Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowls is essential due to their potential complementary properties to molecules such as corannulene and sumanene. However, their development is challenging because of the inherent high strain. Herein, the small electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1 (C20N2H8) and the wavy dimer 2 have been synthesized, and their optical, electronic, and supramolecular properties are extensively studied.







Abstract
Introducing two pyrrole rings at the armchair edges of perylene creates the small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1, which can be viewed as a nitrogen&#8208;doped end&#8208;cap of C70. Despite numerous attempts since 2008, its synthesis has been hindered by strain and synthetic challenges. In this study, we present the synthesis and property analysis of molecular bowl 1 and its dimer, the wavy&#8208;shaped nanographene 2. Substituents on nitrogen atoms significantly affect the bowl depth, intermolecular interactions, and supramolecular behaviors. Consequently, the butyl&#8208;substituted molecular bowl 1&#8201;a forms unusual polar crystals with all bowls oriented similarly, suggesting potential pyroelectric or ferroelectric applications. Due to the electron&#8208;rich nature, compounds 1 exhibit significantly strong binding affinity towards fullerene, with 1&#8201;a forming a sandwich structure with C70. Furthermore, neutral bowls 1 display counter&#8208;rotating ring currents similar to corannulene, while their dications exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The wavy&#8208;structured nanographene 2 demonstrates two continuously reversible oxidation processes, and its dication 22+ shows remarkably high stability under ambient conditions. In summary, this work constructs a small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl and its nanographene dimer, highlighting their exceptional properties, promising applications, and potential as foundations for future advanced nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Constructing Dense Morphology of Sn with High Reversibility under High Areal&#8208;capacity for Anode&#8208;Free Tin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiourea (TU) was proposed as an effective additive to constructing dense morphology of deposited Sn in acidic methylsulfonate&#8208;based electrolyte. By participating in double electrode layer, TU reduces exchange current density of Sn2+/Sn redox, suppresses rampant two&#8208;dimension, and makes Sn anode exert high coulombic efficiency of 99.85% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free Sn battery was developed.







Abstract
Sn electrode possesses high reversibility, redox kinetics and corrosion resistance, as well as non&#8208;toxic and environmental compatibility, which is competitive candidate for aqueous batteries. However, due to huge size of deposition particles and &#8220;dead Sn&#8221;, it is a great challenge to obtain high areal&#8208;capacity (&gt;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible Sn redox electrochemistry with high areal&#8208;capacity enabled by thiourea additive. Systematical investigations reveal the participation of thiourea molecules in the electrical double layer, reducing exchange current density and suppressing rampant two&#8208;dimensional diffusion. As a result, flat and dense scale&#8208;like deposition Sn morphology is obtained, which enables high cycle stability with high areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for symmetrical cell with lean electrolyte (25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and delivering a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;% with practical high 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 area&#8208;capacity for asymmetrical cell. More importantly, anode&#8208;free Organic||Sn battery is developed, and 62&#8201;% capacity retention can be obtained after 570 cycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Triple&#8208;Atom Sites Combined with Oxygen Vacancy for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Propionic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a defect engineering strategy to create asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs), which achieves high propionic acid synthesis rates and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the key roles of OVs and triple&#8208;atom sites. Such OVs&#8208;engineered asymmetric catalytic sites efficiently promote the multistep C&#8722;C coupling process.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon products is an emerging approach for achieving carbon neutrality; however, the design of active sites that effectively promote multistep C&#8722;C coupling remains a challenge. Here, we propose a straightforward defect engineering approach to construct asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (named CWO&#8208;OVs). The optimized CWO&#8208;OVs achieve a photochemical synthesis rate of propionic acid (C3H6O2, PA) of 86.46&#177;2.92&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with an electron&#8208;based selectivity of 89.27&#8201;%, which exhibits a remarkable advantage in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations corroborate the prominent role of OVs in inducing the triple&#8208;atom sites: (1) the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+ triggers the first step of C1&#8208;C1 coupling to form *CH2CH3; (2) Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+ facilitates subsequent C2&#8208;C1 bonding, ultimately leading to PA production. This charge&#8208;asymmetric cascade reaction system offers new insights into the design of efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Anion Adsorption at the Inner&#8208;Helmholtz Plane Directs Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of anion adsorption at the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane in directing CEI formation was investigated using multiple in situ/operando techniques. QCM&#8722;D directly observes its influence on interfacial structure, while in situ spectroscopy and EQCM&#8722;D confirm its impact on CEI chemistry. The anion&#8208;driven interphase leads to a more inorganic&#8208;rich CEI, suppressing electrolyte decomposition and enhancing LiCoO2 cycling stability at high voltages.







Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (CEI) on cathode surface constitutes the foundation of realizing high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet its formation, a highly heterogeneous process involving irreversible reactions between electrolyte components and cathode materials, remains poorly understood. Herein, combining multiple in situ/operando interfacial characterization techniques, we establish the correlation between interfacial structure and interphasial chemistry, and reveal the key role played by adsorptive behavior of various electrolyte components in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane during CEI formation. Quartz crystal microbalance equipped with dissipation modification detects that difluorooxalatoborate (DFOB&#8722;) anion preferentially adsorbed on LiCoO2 tends to expel carbonate solvents from the adsorption layer, thus suppressing their electrochemical decomposition at high voltages and leading to a more compact CEI derived from anions with limited contribution from organic ingredients. Consequently, the CoO2 lattice structure protected by the dense CEI remains intact despite near&#8208;complete delithiation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability for 4.7&#8197;V operation of LiCoO2 cathode. The atomistic&#8208;level insight into the key factors that govern CEI formation provides directive knowledge that accelerates electrolyte design for high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Nanourchin&#8208;like Uricase&#8208;Poly(L&#8208;proline) Conjugate with Retained Enzymatic Activity, Mitigated Immunogenicity, and Sustained Efficacy Upon Repeated Administrations</title>

Poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugated uricase was facilely produced via a grafting&#8208;from approach, which showed mitigated immunogenicity and preserved activity in vivo after repeated injections.







Abstract
The poor half&#8208;life and strong immunogenicity of proteins such as uricase (UOx), a therapeutic enzyme for chronic refractory gout and hyperuricemia, are pressing clinical challenges. Although conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGylation) of UOx can improve the pharmacokinetics, preexisting or induced anti&#8208;PEG antibodies, which lead to accelerate blood clearance (ABC) and reduced response rate, have been a major clinical hurdle. Herein, we report the facile &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; preparation of a nanourchin&#8208;like uricase&#8208;poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugate, namely UOx&#8208;PLP, with high grafting&#8208;density, enhanced thermal, lyophilization, freeze&#8208;thaw, and proteolytic stability. Through a transient preblocking strategy in the synthesis, the UOx&#8208;PLP overcomes activity loss and retains ~82&#8201;% enzyme activity. In Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats, UOx&#8208;PLP stimulates minimum complement activation and anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Unlike PEG&#8208;UOx gave a significantly reduced half&#8208;life after repetitive administrations, UOx&#8208;PLP shows no sign of ABC effect. Moreover, the half&#8208;life of UOx&#8208;PLP remain almost unchanged when cross&#8208;administrated to rats previously received PEG&#8208;UOx and with high titers of anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Finally, UOx&#8208;PLP shows minimum loss of efficacy after five straight administrations in a UOx knock&#8208;out hyperuricemia mice model, whereas PEG&#8208;UOx experiences sharp loss of efficacy upon the same treatment. Overall, the simple preparation and outstanding nonclinical results highlight the enormous potential of UOx&#8208;PLP for future clinical translation.

         <title>Nanofabrication via SEM Electron&#8208;Beam Stimulated Suzuki&#8211;Miyura Type Reaction: Fingerprints of Carbazole Derivative Revealed by Synchrotron&#8208;IR Nanospectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>

This study investigates the conditions under which 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole can be formed in solid state by using a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction triggered by electron beam irradiation. Synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and mass spectrometry revealed signatures of the target product, suggesting a potential palladium&#8208;free reaction pathway and offering a direct route to the fabrication of nanodevices.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based compounds have demonstrated interesting physical and chemical properties for OLED devices. 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole has a direct application in the composition of structures with potential to suppress the loss of efficiency under high luminance conditions along with its use in the emitting layer. In this study, we reveal and explore the conditions in which a triggered electron beams (e&#8208;beams) solid state Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction between 3,6&#8208;diiodocarbazole and phenylboronic acid could be carried out. Applying typical SEM acceleration voltage (30&#8197;keV), sufficient energy transfer enabled the activation of the reaction. Synchrotron Infrared Nano Spectroscopy (SINS) was used to acquire nanoscale molecular vibrational spectra and compare with conventional FTIR absorption spectra for chemical characterization. Evidences obtained by mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole under higher e&#8208;beam dose (30&#8197;keV, 10&#8197;minutes), when compared to 5 and 10&#8197;keV. In addition, the phenylboronic acid seems to have a role in the reaction outcome. Both samples irradiated in the presence and in the absence of palladium exhibited the fingerprints of the expected product 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole shedding light on possible alternative mechanisms and the straightforward construction of nanodevices.

         <title>Crystallization Modulation and Comprehensive Defect Passivation by Carbonyl Functionalized Spacer Cation Towards High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy was proposed of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. By this synergetic strategy, improved crystallization, reduced defect density, released residual stress and minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses were accomplished simultaneously. The inverted devices delivered a champion PCE of 25.77&#8201;%.







Abstract
The inverted cesium/formamidinium (CsFA)&#8208;based methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells possess great potential in simultaneously realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent stability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization process and poor film quality hinder further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, we propose a synergistic modulation strategy of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. L&#8208;Alanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (L&#8208;ABEHCl) containing carbonyl functionalized ammonium cation is incorporated into perovskite precursor solution, increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the crystal growth rate because of its strong interaction with precursor components, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. No 2D perovskite is formed for L&#8208;ABEHCl as additive whereas 2D perovskite is formed upon L&#8208;ABEHCl post&#8208;treatment. It is revealed that FA+ and Cs+ in precursor solution suppress the formation of 2D perovskite. As a result, the L&#8208;ABEHCl passivates the defects at GBs in the form of organic salts and passivates interface defects in the form of 2D perovskite. Due to minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses, the inverted devices using synergistic modulation strategy achieve a maximum PCE of 25.77&#8201;% (certified stabilized PCE of 25.59&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation method. The unencapsulated target device maintains 90.85&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 2300&#8197;h of continuous maximum power point tracking, among the most excellent stabilities accomplished by inverted devices.

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8211;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), distinguished by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently introduced as an adaptable electron&#8208;withdrawing motif to construct interlayer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The unique conformational and electronic structure of BSI imparts excellent thickness tolerance and universal applicability to the interlayer materials, leading to 19.80&#8201;% efficiency OSCs with good operational stability.







Abstract
Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08&#8201;% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84&#8201;% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100&#8197;hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94&#8201;% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90&#8197;nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80&#8201;% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical&#8208;Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing PyGO conductive heterochannel with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity were fabricated through super&#8208;assembly strategy for smart ion transport. Benefiting from the coupling conductivity and photosensitivity of the PPy conductive network, the output power density of salinity gradient energy device with this lamellar photoelectric membrane could achieve 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under illumination.







Abstract
Artificial nanofluidic devices inspired bylight&#8208;driven ion transport in biological systems, leveraging the photoelectric effect, have attracted extensive attention for their potential in signal transduction and smart ion transport applications. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p&#8208;n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify graphene oxide (GO), creating polypyrrole&#8208;graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel&#8208;sized gradients and inherent optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super&#8208;assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl, which is 35.6&#8201;% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real&#8208;time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture. This work presents a novel and effective strategy for light&#8208;driven ion transport with potential applications in energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) disrupt the hydrogen bond network through the surface amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands, activate the interfacial water, and enrich the alkyne molecules. In addition, their unique enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets adsorb alkyne molecules through the &#963;&#8208;bonding mode, allowing the timely desorption of alkene, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% selectivity, and 85&#8201;% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work not only exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.

         <title>Twist and Shine: Ultra&#8208;Narrow Red Emission from Nitrogen and Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen are synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy. These molecules feature a bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene core, with benzopyran rings fused at the periphery to enhance the rigidity of &#960;&#8208;framework. This unique design enables ultra&#8208;narrow red emission, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Nanographenes, known for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have garnered significant interest for their tunable electronic structures, particularly through heteroatom doping. Herein, we report the synthesis of two twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes (h&#8208;NGs) co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen via a three&#8208;step strategy, where the tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization and ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution serve as a key step. Both h&#8208;NGs incorporate a unique bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene (BFDAC) core, with one further extending the &#960;&#8208;system via peri&#8208;fusion of four benzopyran units. Single&#8208;crystal analyses reveal that BFDAC core of both h&#8208;NGs adopts a highly twisted geometry, whereas the benzopyran&#8208;fused one has enhanced rigidity. Theoretical studies confirm a global aromaticity with 30 &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized along BFDAC periphery. Notably, co&#8208;doping enables precise electronic tuning, with pyridinic nitrogen lowering the LUMO level and benzopyran oxygen raising the HOMO level. Both h&#8208;NGs display the red photoluminescence (PL), and the benzopyran&#8208;fused derivative exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm, among the narrowest reported for organic red&#8208;emitting materials. Both h&#8208;NGs exhibit acid&#8208;responsive optical behavior including near&#8208;infrared absorption shift and PL quenching, providing additional functional versatility.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Uric Acid Oxidation via Interdistance&#8208;Dependent Switching Pathways in Correlated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Boosting Sensing Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlated ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Ru c&#8208;SACs) with tailored single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) of 9.3&#8197;&#197;, 7.0&#8197;&#197;, and 6.2&#8197;&#197; were prepared via organometallic design. The Ru c&#8208;SAC with 6.2&#8197;&#197; SAD exhibited superior uric acid electrooxidation activity due to the optimal inter&#8208;atomic distance facilitating a three&#8208;electron transfer pathway, substantiated by comprehensive experimental studies and theoretical computations, and unveiling atomic&#8208;level SAD&#8208;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The overly simplistic geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a significant bottleneck in the field of single&#8208;atom sensing, impeding both the design of highly efficient electrochemical sensors and the establishment of structure&#8211;activity relationships. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy to boost the sensing performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by precisely tuning the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs). A series of Ru&#8208;based c&#8208;SACs (Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197;, Rud=7.0&#8201;&#197;, and Rud=9.3&#8201;&#197;) are synthesized with predetermined SAD values, which are comprehensively characterized by various techniques. Electrochemical studies on uric acid (UA) oxidation reveal that Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197; demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity of 9.83&#8197;&#956;A &#956;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;2, which is superior to most of electrochemistry biosensors reported previously. Kinetic analysis and product examination unveil that the 6.2&#8197;&#197; Ru SAD instigates a distinctive three&#8208;electron oxidation of UA, with an extra electron transfer compared to the conventional two&#8208;electron pathway, which fundamentally enhances its sensitivity. Density functional theory calculations confirm the optimal SAD facilitates dual&#8208;site UA adsorption and accelerated charge transfer dynamics. This investigation provides novel insights into the strategic engineering of high&#8208;performance SAC&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by precisely controlling the atomic&#8208;scale structure of active sites.

         <title>Nucleation Engineering to Strengthen Interface Contacts in Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the nucleation barrier at the substrate surface, the nucleation process is prone to occur at the substrate, resulting in intimate interface contact, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed interface nonradiative recombination. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with improved thermal stability is achieved, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance. Herein, we report strengthening crystal/substrate contact by nucleation engineering based on in situ growth strategy. Through modulating the hole transport layer (HTL) to induce the nucleation process at substrate surface, interface residual solution, voids, and small&#8208;sized crystals are eliminated, thus ensuring intimate interface contact physically. Combining with strong interaction between perovskites and HTL, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed nonradiative recombination are achieved. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Moreover, the thermal&#8208;induced peeling&#8208;off of crystals from substrates is mitigated, which improves the device thermal stability distinctly.

         <title>Sequence Similarity Network Guided Discovery of a Dehydrogenase for Asymmetric Carbonyl Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive sequence similarity network based approach enabled the identification of a diverse array of uncharacterized enzymes from nature, leading to the discovery of several novel asymmetric carbonyl desaturation enzymes. Among them, the most outstanding enzyme, TgDH, demonstrated remarkable stereoselectivity and reactivity, catalyzing the synthesis of various chiral cyclohexenones bearing &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters with high efficiency.







Abstract
Carbonyl dehydrogenation is one of the most valuable transformations in modern synthetic chemistry. As compared to traditional chemical synthesis methods, enzymatic dehydrogenation offers a greener and more selective alternative. However, except for a few rare natural dehydrogenases for desaturation, current enzymatic methods predominantly rely on enzyme promiscuity, which often suffers from lower efficiency and limited reaction controllability. Herein, we employed sequence similarity networks to mine natural dehydrogenases from a vast array of sequences with potential dehydrogenation activity. This approach led to the discovery of an uncharacterized FAD&#8208;dependent enzyme capable of efficiently performing the desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones, thereby generating diverse cyclohexenones bearing remote &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. The current method has enhanced the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately 178&#8208;fold as compared to the best existing biocatalytic strategies and displayed almost no overoxidation reactions. Through a combination of experimental assays and computational studies, we elucidated that this enzyme enhances its dehydrogenation capability through an unconventional proton relay system, absent in previously reported enzyme promiscuity systems. Additionally, this streamlined enzymatic process demonstrated scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with maintained efficiency and selectivity, offering robust and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of chiral cyclohexenones with high optical purity.

The synthesis of chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains in single&#8208;crystal form enable chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes to be systematically investigated for the first time. Notably, NS achieves a record&#8208;high mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), which enlarges the family of emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSCs with high mobility for practical applications.







Abstract
Developing (hetero)cycloarenes, an emerging class of ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications remains significantly constrained due to their synthetic challenge and limited diversity of available materials. Herein, a series of coplanar chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains were synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form, and chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes was investigated in detailed. Sulfur&#8208;fused NS exhibits a closest herringbone crystal packing with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance as low as 3.11&#8197;&#197;, resulting in a record&#8208;high hole mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped OSCs. Remarkably, selenium&#8208;fused NSe without intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in its crystalline state, also manifests the second highest mobility of up to 2.11&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is attributed to the presence of extensive short&#8208;range edge&#8208;to&#8208;face Se&#8230;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions. Furthermore, these heterocycloarenes exhibit a selective supramolecular interaction with C70, with the trend in binding constants being: NS &lt; NO &lt; NSe. Overall, this work not only systematically elucidates the role of atom engineering on heterocycloarenes for the first time, but also paves the way for practical applications of the emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSC materials.

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three volatile imide additives with large dipole moments which improved the performance of the OSCs device by manipulating the crystallization process of the acceptor were reported. These additives could induce the acceptor to first nucleate and then grow, forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains and improving charge transport. One of the highest power conversion efficiencies of 19.04% was achieved for D18:L8&#8208;BO devices treated with pClPA.







Abstract
Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13&#8201;% to 18.58&#8201;%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04&#8201;% was achieved. Our results indicate using imide unit to construct solid additives is a simple and effective strategy, and the positional isomerization of halogen atom also has a large effect on the photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Superhelical Self&#8208;Assembly of Microcrystals from Cyclodipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

A cyclodipeptide platform delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner. Here we present a cyclodipeptide platform which delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in situ reaction&#8208;induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra&#8208;high yields and phase purity. The pathway comprises formation of subunit microcrystals and the subsequent assembly through adhesion of favorable planes. The cyclodipeptide adopts a folded geometry that generates 2D hydrogen bonded networks differing from the typical 1D duplex hydrogen bonding of diketopiperazines skeletons. The assembly of subunit crystals driven by the hydrogen bonding undergoes dislocations mediated by the inherent chirality of cyclodipeptides. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of pure hydrocarbon materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs is reported. Blue MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs using either DtBuCzB or v&#8208;DABNA as emitter and either FIrpic, fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 or CN&#8722;Ir as sensitizer, achieved very high maximum external quantum efficiencies ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%, due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts.







Abstract
Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). High&#8208;performance blue OLEDs still pose a considerable challenge. Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronic technologies. In this study, we designed a series of original high&#8208;triplet PHC materials based on a multi&#8208;substitution approach of the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as a host in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on the 2,6&#8208;bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR&#8208;TADF OLED devices based on v&#8208;DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQEmax of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high&#8208;performance devices.

Devices based on the 2,6-bis(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac-Ir(tpz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) values ranging from 29.1&#8201;% to 33.9&#8201;%. Additionally, blue MR-TADF OLED devices based on &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8722;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of approximately 31&#8201;% due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full-width at half-maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll-off. This study marks the first application of PHC materials as hosts in phosphorescence-sensitized MR-TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for next-generation blue OLEDs and offering a viable pathway to achieve high-performance devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Closed Four&#8208;Link Chains and Borromean Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (841links) and Borromean links (632 links) have been successfully synthesized in one&#8208;step processes. The interlocked molecules were generated by the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions of bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole ligands and binuclear Cp*Rh/Ir&#8208;based precursors.







Abstract
Despite substantial advancements in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), the efficient construction of higher order links remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the highly efficient one&#8208;step directed construction of a series of unprecedented molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (84 1 metalla&#8208;links), achieved through the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions involving binuclear rhodium/iridium precursors and bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligands. Meanwhile, modulating the substituent positions of the pyridine groups in the ligand resulted in a change in topological structure, leading to the formation of two molecular Borromean links (

metalla&#8208;links). The molecular configurations of the abovementioned metalla&#8208;links were clearly identified through mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, structural transformation between the molecular Borromean links and corresponding monocycles was achieved through concentration effects, as validated by solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy investigations.

         <title>Luminescent Alkylaluminium Anthranilates Reaching Unity Quantum Yield in the Condensed Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrameric alkylaluminium anthranilates have been synthesised that&#160;exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent photoluminescence performance. In one of the complexes,&#160;intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions have been found to lead to a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Transition, post&#8208;transition and rare earth metal complexes supported by (O,N)&#8208; and (N,N)&#8208;type ligands dominate organometallic photochemistry. However, despite a vast number of aminobenzoate metal complexes having been reported, and aluminium being globally abundant, alkylaluminium anthranilates have not yet been considered as effective luminophores. Herein, using a family of commercially available ligands composed of anthranilic acid (anth&#8208;H2) and its N&#8208;substituted derivatives, we report the isolation and characterisation of a series of unique tetrameric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal alkylaluminium anthranilates, [(R'&#8208;anth)AlR]4. The resulting compounds are characterised using spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to analyse structure&#8208;determining factors in the solid state and solution. Moreover, by changing the N&#8208;substituents from H to Me and Ph, we have yielded a series of luminophores that exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent performance, providing a [(Ph&#8208;anth)AlEt]4 derivative that achieves a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase, which is unprecedented for aluminium complexes.

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trimming&#8208;&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino&#8208;metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.







Abstract
Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&#8722;2 to 1.3&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built&#8208;in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity&#8208;dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH3 and NO2 using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte was designed to break the trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity from aqueous electrolyte and the stable interface from hydrogel electrolyte, through the high ionic conductive bulk electrolyte and lean&#8208;water hydrogel&#8208;like state interface. This work paves a new way for electrolyte design towards pratical zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25&#8201;%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average coulombic efficiency (over 99.90&#8201;%). By demonstrating the remarkable performance, our work represents an advancement in zinc metal batteries toward a practical scale and is expected to set a stepping stone for transformative advancements in energy storage technologies.

         <title>A Druglike Ferrostatin&#8208;1 Analogue as a Ferroptosis Inhibitor and Photoluminescent Indicator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole as a bio&#8208;isostere of the ester group in Fer&#8208;1 not only provides druglike Ferfluor&#8208;1 with high potency and favorable blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability for a significant anti&#8208;ferroptosis effect in vivo, but also creates a unique ratiometric photoluminescent probe sensitive to the fluctuation of ferroptosis by an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) mechanism.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have long suffered from a shortage of suitable drugs and probes of high specificity. In the context of anti&#8208;ferroptosis research for neurological diseases, the inaccessibility of a blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeable small molecular ferroptosis inhibitor, and the lack of specific ferroptosis probes, seriously impeded a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis and the development of clinically applicable drugs. We report herein a novel 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole&#8208;functionalized druglike ferrostatin analogue entitled Ferfluor&#8208;1 with superior anti&#8208;ferroptosis potency, favorable BBB permeability and in vivo activity against stroke and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the exclusive pseudo&#8208;excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) property of Ferfluor&#8208;1 via a long&#8208;distance hydrogen&#8208;bonding network makes it the first sensitive ratiometric photoluminescent probe to detect phospholipid hydroperoxides and a specific indicator for the fluctuation of ferroptosis. These unprecedented advantages not only make Ferfluor&#8208;1 a potential tool for ferroptosis&#8208;related diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the central nervous system, but also pave the way to developing new theragnostic agents for precision redox detection and regulation.

         <title>Dynamic Short Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network Enhancing Hydrophilicity in Biomimetic Membranes with Artificial Water Channels for Efficient Removal of Dyes and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated biomimetic membrane combining I&#8208;quartet water channels and sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide achieves simultaneous dye and salt rejection with high water permeance. Leveraging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, this design enhances antifouling performance and provides an energy&#8208;efficient solution for textile wastewater treatment.







Abstract
The development of an integrated biomimetic membrane capable of rejecting both dyes and salts in a single step, while sustaining stable water permeation, presents a promising solution for textile wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a novel integrated biomimetic membrane integrating an I&#8208;quartet artificial water channel (AWC) with sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide (PA&#8208;SO3H), which can stably reject both dyes and inorganic salts. The I&#8208;quartet channels (2.68&#8197;&#197;), formed via self&#8208;assembly of alkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole (HC8) molecules, facilitate selective water transport and rejection of both dyes and inorganic salts. Concurrently, the sulfonic acid groups (&#8722;SO3H) could grab water molecules, forming dynamic short hydrogen&#8208;bonding network (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O). These hydrogen bonds not only serve as jumping force, lowering the energy barrier for water transport through the alternating hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic matrix, but also act as an effective antifouling barrier, significantly reducing membrane fouling. The optimal HC83.0&#8208;PA&#8208;SO3H membrane exhibits a water permeance of 13.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8208;2&#8197;h&#8208;1&#8197;MPa&#8208;1, approximately 2.7&#8208;fold higher than that of the pristine PA membrane, and both high dyes and salts rejection efficiency. Moreover, the membrane sustains stable antifouling characteristics throughout a 19&#8208;day endurance test. This innovative membrane design provides a promising solution for the efficient separation of both dyes and inorganic salts in textile wastewater treatment.

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a mussel foot protein (Mfp) membrane&#8208;enclosed zero&#8208;order controlled release system by biomimicking the working principle of the mussel plaque. The thin membrane forms directly in situ on the surface of the crystalline drugs, achieving a high drug&#8208;loading capability. In streptozotocin&#8208;induced type 1 diabetic mice, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated insulin crystals can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemia for a week. Similarly, in healthy rats, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated progesterone crystals can maintain its plasma drug concentration for up to one week.







Abstract
Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt;90&#8201;%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7&#8197;days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7&#8197;days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35&#8197;days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and the treatment of distinct diseases.

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The higher permeability of positively charged water channels Ch+ arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H&#8208;bond interactions of NH3+ groups with water compared to COO&#8722; groups in negatively charged channels Ch&#8722;, and K+ ions around COO&#8722; slowing water rotation more than Cl&#8722; ions around NH3+.







Abstract
The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8722;). The higher permeability of Ch+ channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+ and Ch&#8722; channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8722; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8722;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8722; group in Ch&#8722; channels. K+ ions concentrated around the COO&#8722; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8722; ions around the NH3+ groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels exert less stable H-bond interaction with water than the COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group in &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; channels. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions concentrated around the COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions around the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high-performance AWCs at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Ferrocenyl Aminoalcohols: Simultaneous Induction of Multiple Types of Chirality by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficient enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes with a chiral aminoalcohol group was developed via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. The desired products were obtained in excellent yield with high enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) by using phosphine&#8211;olefin ligands with a planar chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold.







Abstract
Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208;opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.

         <title>Integrated Electrochemical Biomass Oxidation and CO2 Reduction over Ultra&#8208;wide Potential Window</title>

A Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V and a large CO partial current density of 608.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Integrated solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo&#8208;isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release performance using these light&#8208;responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.







Abstract
Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8211;270&#8197;nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8211;2.14&#8197;nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7&#8197;times greater than that of electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ionogels from Dynamic Polyrotaxane&#8208;Based Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes were designed by introducing ionic liquid to dynamically crosslinked polyrotaxane networks. The competitive coordination of lithium ions between the polymer chain segments and the ionic liquid molecular clusters facilitates lithium&#8208;ion migration. The ionogel electrolyte enables lithium symmetrical cells with stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours and the NMC622||Li battery with excellent rate and cycling performance at 20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The swelling of a polymer matrix by ionic liquids and additional lithium salts may lead to the formation of ionogel electrolytes. However, the introduction of additional ions usually results in a decreased lithium&#8208;ion transference number, because of the trapping of the lithium ions in clusters and polymer&#8208;ion complexes. Achieving highly efficient lithium&#8208;ion migration and increasing lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium&#8208;ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and tLi+=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium&#8208;lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.

Achieving highly efficient lithium-ion migration and increasing lithium-ion transference number (t&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium-ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium-lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulated Multicomponent Reaction Pathway by Pore&#8208;Confinement Effect in MOFs for Highly Efficient Catalysis of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully modulated reaction pathway in the multicomponent reaction of propargylic amines, phosphine oxide and CO2 through the confinement effect of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a catalyst. The MOF with pores of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; can selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, preferentially react to form oxazolidinones, which further react with the phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce the final product. This result in high catalytic performance and excellent substrate generality.







Abstract
The conversion of flue gas CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond&#8208;formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free framework (Cu&#8208;TCA) was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO2 by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; in Cu&#8208;TCA selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger&#8208;sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO2 and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in Cu&#8208;TCA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of Cu&#8208;TCA with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Negative Hydrogen with Bimetallic&#8208;Ternary&#8208;Structured Catalysts for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen evolution form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1 and achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours using AB as H in converting nitrobenzene to anilines.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) with in situ negative hydrogen (H&#8722;) has received extensive attention as an alternative to conventional high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation processes. However, the insufficient activity of hydrogen production and unclear the conversion process of hydrogenation remain a great challenge. In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary&#8208;structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1&#8208;TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H&#8722; donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB. Mechanistic studies revealed that the high hydrolysis activity was due to that the Ru SA and Co SA sites of the bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalyst required the lowest energy for the activation of AB and H2O, respectively. Remarkably, the Co SA and Ru clusters exhibited an obvious synergistic effect in the TH process, which promoted the tandem hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. This work demonstrated an efficient approach to generate H&#8722; donor with bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts in TH process and further provided new inspiration on the development of multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme Surface Residues Direct Encapsulation into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Performance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to guide the formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by exposing surface residues of proteins, thereby embedding enzymes into MOFs. Nitrogen&#8208;enriched Cyt&#8197;c serves as a model to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, leading to significantly improve enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency. The strategy is applicable for a variety of enzymes, demonstrating the potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Herein, we highlight the role of nitrogen&#8208;enriched surface groups on proteins in directing topological transformations of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Using a modified&#8208;protein&#8208;directed MOFs template synthesis (mDTS) strategy, we demonstrate that these surface modifications on cytochrome c (Cyt&#8197;c) selectively induce the formation of leaf&#8208;like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;L). This approach not only enables a structural transition from ZIF&#8208;8 to a more open ZIF&#8208;L framework but also substantially enhances the catalytic activity and loading of Cyt&#8197;c beyond traditional immobilization methods. Adjusting the concentration of the surface modifier allows for precise tuning of the Cyt&#8197;c activity, allowing optimal enzyme function at specific modifier levels. Furthermore, our results reveal that surface modifications of a variety of proteins can facilitate the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, emphasizing the broad applicability of the mDTS method. This approach offers significant promise for developing highly efficient protein&#8208;MOF composites, offering transformative potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Reduction and Biosynthesis Towards Sustainable CO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

This work delivers a photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO2 into long&#8208;chain sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added compounds.







Abstract
Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) into long&#8208;chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value&#8208;added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO2 reduction to energy&#8208;rich sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO2 to CH4 with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#946;+). Subsequently, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene using photocatalytically&#8208;obtained CH4 as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a green, low&#8208;energy pathway for the synthesis of long&#8208;chain compounds from CO2 as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long&#8208;term energy demands and sustainable CO2 upcycling.

&lt;p&gt;This work delivers a photocatalysis-biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into long-chain sucrose or &#945;-farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to value-added compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into long-chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value-added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis-biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to energy-rich sucrose or &#945;-farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as-prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Subsequently, &lt;i&gt;Methylomicrobium buryatense&lt;/i&gt; 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;-farnesene using photocatalytically-obtained CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This study provides a green, low-energy pathway for the synthesis of long-chain compounds from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long-term energy demands and sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upcycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given that chiral bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are stacked straight forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assembly, eight assemblies with different symmetries can be considered. In this study, seven of eight assemblies are selectively synthesized with minimal alternations in their molecular structures. These assemblies will be useful for the quantitative discussion for structure&#8211;property relationship.







Abstract
Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent that enables previously inaccessible radical chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of alkenes, as well as highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of heteroarenes. The method involves conversion of the weakly electrophilic bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate into a masked electrophile, significantly increasing its reactivity, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates 515 candidate structures featuring a planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atom, adhering to the 18 valence electron rule and formulated as OXnYmq. Among these, 35 global minima were identified, primarily stabilized by Group 13 elements with charge states spanning &#8722;1 to +1. Notably, bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions&#8212;from covalent to polar ionic&#8212;that challenge traditional assumptions about unconventional oxygen bonding motifs.







Abstract
Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OXnYmq, where n+m=4, q ranging from +2 to &#8722;2, and following the 18&#8208;valence electron rule. High&#8208;level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group&#8197;13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO&#8208;containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas&#8208;phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Boosted Stability and Kinetics under a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce silk fibroin (SF) as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, boosting the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of aqueous Zn ion batteries across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. SF disrupts H&#8208;bond networks in H2O and coordinates Zn2+, reducing viscosity and suppressing side reactions. It also forms a hydrophilic/zincophilic SF&#8208;film on both electrodes, enabling uniform Zn plating and preventing cathode dissolution.







Abstract
Sustainable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) necessitate a wide operational temperature range to ensure practicability, yet achieving this often compromises either reaction kinetics at low temperatures or cycling stability at high temperatures. Here we present an electrolyte design that balances this trade&#8208;off, enhancing the stability and kinetics of AZIBs across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Our approach incorporates silk fibroin as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, which modifies both electrolyte structure and electrode interphase. Specifically, Zn||Zn half&#8208;cells with this electrolyte realize low hysteresis (180&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and stable operation (200&#8197;hours at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This electrolyte is compatible with both inorganic and organic cathode materials. Remarkably, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level Zn||V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&#8722;1 with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries at extreme temperatures.

Remarkably, an ampere-hour-level Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>From Holodirected to Hemidirected Coordination Activated by Oxygenation Strategy: A Facile Route to Long Wave Infrared Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair electrons of Sb3+ in halides can be activated by oxygen atom, which inspired the creation of the first alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalide Rb2Sb2OCl6. Its birefringence has been increased by an order of magnitude compared with the holodirected coordination Rb13Sb8Cl37. Large&#8208;sized crystal measurements show that Rb2Sb2OCl6 features a good transmittance from 0.4 to 13.5&#8197;&#956;m, covering the near, mid and long wave infrared range, confirming its potential as a long wave infrared birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Long wave infrared (LWIR) birefringent crystals are essential for infrared optical applications but such materials are rarely reported due to the requirements of large birefringence and wide infrared transmission range. This study proposes a facile route to create new LWIR birefringent crystal by oxygenation strategy in halides with cations containing lone pair electrons. Given the tendency of such cations to form holodirected geometry, a divalent oxygen was introduced to substitute the monovalent halogen to decrease the coordination number and activate the lone pair electrons. Our efforts in Rb+&#8208;Sb3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; system result three new structures, namely, Rb13Sb8Cl37, Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6. The holodirected SbCl6 in Rb13Sb8Cl37 has been successfully translated to hemidirected SbOCl4 in Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb2Sb2OCl6 reached to 0.191@550&#8197;nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb13Sb8Cl37 (0.017@550&#8197;nm). Large&#8208;sized crystal of Rb2Sb2OCl6 have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2&#8197;mm3). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8211;13.5&#8197;&#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system &#8211; alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.

         <title>Re and Ru Co&#8208;Doped Transition Metal Alloy as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrooxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Re co&#8208;doped NiCoFe alloy exhibited efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. By employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously with a stable operation over 450&#8197;h.







Abstract
Glycerol electrooxidation (GOR), as an innovative strategy for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, is considered a promising anodic alternative to oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis. However, the high potential and the limited selectivity and faradaic efficiency impede the industrial&#8208;scale application toward GOR. Herein, we for the first time constructed rhenium and ruthenium co&#8208;doped transition metal alloy (NiCoFeRuRe) for the efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. Benefiting from the rapid generation of M3+&#8208;OOH induced by Ru element and the inhibition of OER and excessive oxidation of glycerol by Re species through in situ chacterization, the optimized NiCoFeRuRe requires only 1.133 VRHE to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a faradaic efficiency of 95.6&#8201;% for formate product with a stability more than 450&#8197;h. Importantly, employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously, which is 265&#8197;mV lower than the electrolytic water splitting owning an excellent stability of 350&#8197;h. This work provides a facile strategy for rationally designing high&#8208;performance GOR catalysts for biomass upgradings.

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>

A facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy is applied to create NMP&#8208;SACs consisting of Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC) for exceptional HER activity. As an H&#8208;pump, Con supply hydrogen for Pt1 sites through accelerated water dissociation, enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.







Abstract
Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.

         <title>Niobium Phosphide&#8208;Induced Sulfur Cathode Interface with Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Flux Enables Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbP induces the decomposition of lithium salts, which resulting in the formation of a LiF&#8208; and LiN&#8208;rich interfacial layer at the sulfur cathode interface for facilitating high&#8208;flux Li+ transport. The optimized interface reduces the conversion energy barrier of Li2S and effectively prevents the passivation of catalytic active sites.







Abstract

         <title>Synthesis of Selenium&#8208;Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes have been synthesized to unveil the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host molecules. Compared to oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based analogues, selenium&#8208;embedded host enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling, accelerates reverse intersystem crossing, and improves bipolar transport, enabling the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a wide color gamut.







Abstract
The internal heavy&#8208;atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium&#8208;doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylselanyl)pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz&#8208;BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BFP) and sulfur&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz&#8208;BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz&#8208;BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high&#8208;performance, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut TADF&#8208;OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph&#8208;OLEDs) and TADF&#8208;sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Battery with Highly Reversible Bromine Conversion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>

ZnSO4 solution is initially screened as the electrolyte for bromide cathodes. Subsequently, a targeted sequestration strategy is proposed to modify KBr cathode, achieving high&#8208;reversibility bromine conversion chemistry. In situ Raman spectra reveal a Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722;&#8208;dominated conversion mechanism. A large&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;Br pouch cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 98.46&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92&#8201;% after 775 cycles at 3&#8197;C.







Abstract
Br2/Br&#8722; conversion reaction with a high operating potential (1.85&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn) is promising for designing high&#8208;energy cathodes in aqueous Zn batteries. However, the ultrahigh solubility of polybromides causes significant shuttle effects, capacity deterioration, and self&#8208;discharge, rendering the study of static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries still in its infancy. Here, various aqueous zinc salt electrolytes are first screened, showing that, compared to other salts, ZnSO4 is more suitable for Br&#8208;based cathodes benefiting from its higher negative charge density and lower cost. Nevertheless, the significant shuttle effect of polybromides remains in such an electrolyte. We further develop a targeted sequestration strategy to fundamentally confine polybromide migration from KBr cathode into electrolyte. In high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (22 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) pouch cells, the average Coulombic efficiency enhances from 92.3&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;%, and self&#8208;discharge performance dramatically improves from 17.4&#8201;% capacity retention to 85.2&#8201;% after 72&#8197;h of resting, indicating the effectiveness of our strategy in confining the shuttle effects. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell delivers an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.88&#8201;% and a zinc utilization of 22&#8201;% at a high rate of 3&#8197;C. Our findings also pave the way for the design of advanced Br&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 20/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present menace: Emissions of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8212;forever chemicals&#8212;represent a risk for the environment and human health. However, mitigation strategies lack. In their Minireview (e202424718), Patrick Lott, Florian Maurer, and Arik Beck discuss a roadmap on how to tackle PFAS emission in the gas phase using catalysis. Their cover art pays tribute to the iconic movie poster of the masterpiece Star Wars Episode 1, showing a CF4 molecule shadowing its past as long&#8208;chain PFAS onto a catalyst surface.

         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical&#8208;assisted approach converts elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymers with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) junctions, mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO2 photoreduction with H2O, without additional photosensitizers, sacrificial agents, or cocatalysts. The key innovation is a mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction, enabling sustainable solid&#8208;state condensation of sulfur with 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes to form bent thianthrene units.

         <title>Sustainable Pathways for the Synthesis of Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite) plays a key role in construction as a hydraulic binder. Due to its instability in water, industrial production primarily relies on thermal dehydration of gypsum. This review examines alternative, potentially more sustainable methods for the synthesis of bassanite, including gypsum conversion at lower temperatures and direct precipitation from organic solvents or in the presence of specific additives. The benefits, drawbacks, and overall impact on sustainability of the different proposed approaches are critically assessed.







Abstract
Calcium sulfate, and especially its hemihydrate form (bassanite), is crucial in the construction industry, primarily used as a hydraulic binder in cements, mortars, and wallboards. Because of the rapid transformation of bassanite into thermodynamically stable gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) upon contact with water, natural deposits are scarce, rendering it one of the most extensively produced inorganic materials worldwide. Currently, bassanite is derived from mined or waste gypsum through a thermal dehydration process, which is energy&#8208;intensive and costly. As sustainability has become a key target for industrial processes and products, a series of studies aiming to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of bassanite production was published recently. Two primary approaches are pursued: conversion of gypsum and direct precipitation of bassanite from solution. In both cases, organic solvents, (specific) additives and/or elevated temperatures have been used to control the activity/availability of water in the reaction medium and thus direct phase selection towards bassanite. This review offers a comprehensive overview of alternative bassanite production methods, critically examining their benefits, potential downsides, and overall impact on the sustainability of industrial&#8208;scale use.

         <title>Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of PFAS emission abatement, this minireview addresses catalytic gas phase PFAS decomposition and the associated overarching challenges involving fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and reaction engineering. In addition, concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions are introduced.







Abstract
While the outstanding stability of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) paved the way for their widespread application in a huge variety of applications, it also resulted in their nickname &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221;. The rising awareness for PFAS&#8208;related environmental and health concerns drives a discussion on the most effective ways to abate PFAS emissions into the environment, i.e. water, soil, and air, and remediation of contaminated matter. In order to address the knowledge gap regarding air pollution by PFAS, this minireview summarizes the current corpus of work in the field and outlines how catalysis can contribute to PFAS abatement in the gas phase. Beyond a mere collection of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, overarching challenges in catalytic PFAS removal are identified, spanning from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry, i.e. C&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation, to heterogeneous catalysis, i.e. surface reactions at the gas&#8208;solid interface, to reaction engineering, i.e. scaling relations and technical hurdles. In addition, the article introduces concepts and workflows that aim at providing guidance during the design of technological solutions for the efficient control of gaseous PFAS emissions.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereoelements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights recent advances in the construction of nonadjacent stereogenic elements and summarizes the various strategies employed, including bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis, and other approaches. The synthetic applications and mechanistic investigations are also discussed to facilitate understanding of this field.








Abstract
Nonadjacent chiral scaffolds are privileged motifs in bioactive molecules and medicines, which have stimulated chemists&#8217; ingenuity in achieving the asymmetric construction of non&#8208;contiguous chiral elements directly. Current strategies include bifunctional catalysis, synergistic catalysis, cascade catalysis and others, enabling the production of a wide range of enantiomerically enriched compounds featuring different combinations of nonadjacent chirality, including multiple elements of central chirality, central and allenyl axial chirality, and central and biaryl axial chirality. As compared to the patterns of multiple nonadjacent elements of central chirality, the latter two are less frequently reported. This minireview aims to summarize the key developments in reaction design, mechanistic studies, and synthetic applications, with the goal of stimulating further exploration in this important area of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Sulfur Conversion to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder Polymer Networks through Mechanochemical Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid&#8208;state synthetic approach was developed to directly convert elemental sulfur into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor molecular junctions, by exploiting mechanochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting sulfur&#8208;rich conjugated polymer exhibits successful CO2 photoreduction with H2O vapor, without adding any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods capable of converting elemental sulfur into conjugated porous sulfur&#8208;rich polymers remains a great challenge, although direct utilization of this readily available feedstock can significantly enrich its uses and circumvent environmental problems during sulfur storage. We report herein mechanochemical (MC) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) that enables sulfur conversion into thianthrene&#8208;bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) molecular junctions. We demonstrate that the key lies in the generation of bent thianthrene units through a solid&#8208;state ball&#8208;milling condensation reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihaloarenes and elemental sulfur. We also show that the assembling of D&#8722;A structural motifs into porous networks affords efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. Exceptional photoinduced charge separation along with boosted exciton dissociation results in a high&#8208;performance of carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 306.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by H2O oxidation to O2, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical results. We anticipate this novel MC SNAr approach will advance processing techniques for direct sulfur utilization and facilitate new possibilities for the synthesis of D&#8722;A ladder polymer networks with promising potential in photocatalysis.

         <title>Profiling Allosteric Modulators of CB1R with an Allosteric Fluoroprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based assay to directly profile CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) independently of orthosteric radioligands. Our fluorescent tracer allows for distinction between allosteric and orthosteric ligands and reliable determination of CB1R AM binding affinities. (TOC Figure created in BioRender. Ganzoni, R.

Abstract
Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi=5.34 and 5.67, respectively).

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of four highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing different glycoforms has been achieved via an efficient chemoenzymatic approach, relying on the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that sialylated glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enzymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Cocatalyst for Hydroquinone Oxidation Enables Aerobic Oxidation of Primary Alcohols to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A commercially available heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst supports efficient aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone, outperforming homogeneous molecular cobalt and iron cocatalysts that have been used to support redox cascades. This Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/benzoquinone cocatalyst system supports the highly efficient oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a homogeneous Ir catalyst in organic solvent.







Abstract
Benzoquinone (BQ) is commonly used as a cocatalyst in multi&#8208;component catalyst systems for aerobic oxidation of organic molecules. Such methods often proceed by a redox cascade in which a secondary catalyst supports aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to BQ. The present study shows that a commercially available non&#8208;precious metal heterogeneous catalyst, PAJ&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, is much more efficient than established homogeneous catalysts for aerobic oxidation of HQ to BQ, and this improved reactivity is crucial to support aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with the homogeneous iridium catalyst, [Ir(trop2DAD]OTf (trop2DAD=N,N&#8208;bis(5&#8208;H&#8208;dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene). The combination of this heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyst system operates with Ir catalyst loadings as low as 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover frequencies &#8805;350&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn3Si4P11 demonstrates superior second&#8208;harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn3Si4P9.







Abstract
Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn3Si4P11 from the kindred SrIn3Si4P9, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30&#8208;fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn3Si4P9.

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates superior second-harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second-harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi-asymmetric-module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand-new non-centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, which showcases the characteristics of a three-dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] and [In&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from the kindred SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30-fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5-fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Arylations and Alkenylations of 2&#8208;Aminobiaryls with Atmospheric Air as the Sole Oxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a mild, enantioselective method for the arylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aminobiaryl compounds to produce highly valuable, enantioenriched anilines exhibiting axial chirality. The kinetic resolution process is catalyzed by Pd(II) in combination with an isobutyryl&#8208;protected isoleucine ligand (iBoc&#8208;Ile&#8208;OH), using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant and DMSO as cosolvent. The products can be divergently manipulated to give optically active, axially chiral derivatives of high interest for asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Optically active 2&#8208;aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8722;C coupling product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the in situ formation of a phospholipid and its chemical energy driven assembly into transient vesicles. Our synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which are uniform and 65&#8197;nm in diameter, were obtained by a metabolism&#8208;like process i.e., formation by simply mixing the precursors and simultaneous degradation by an enzyme. This results in temporally controlled vesicles. Moreover, the cargo release from our vesicles can be dynamically regulated for drug delivery.







Abstract
Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio&#8208;inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self&#8208;assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic&#8208;like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double&#8208;tailed, vesicle&#8208;forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65&#8197;nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery. We have demonstrated that the release kinetics of the incorporated cargo molecules can be dynamically regulated for potential applications in adaptive nanomedicine.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry in a Capillary Applied to the Facilitation of the Crystalline Sponge Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;One&#8208;droplet&#8221; host&#8211;guest chemistry was achieved by using a glass capillary, enabling the efficient crystallization and structure determination of various host&#8211;guest complexes. Two coordination hosts, the cage and the crystalline sponge (CS), were examined. Notably, using a capillary addressed several persistent technical challenges in the CS method, greatly simplifying and accelerating the analysis of molecular structures.







Abstract
Capillary is a handy tool for transferring, mixing, and storing small volumes of liquid. Here, we show that the stepwise dipping of host and guest solutions into a capillary allows efficient preparation, crystallization, and X&#8208;ray analysis of various host&#8211;guest complexes. The crystals formed in capillaries are comparable in quality to those grown in regular flasks and subjected to X&#8208;ray analysis without being removed from the capillary. We further apply the capillary technique to the crystalline sponge method, a practical domain of host&#8211;guest chemistry, successfully overcoming several technical issues.

         <title>Lithium Anionic Dicarbenes or Acetylides: What is in the Name?</title>

         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called lithium anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC). X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies reveal that Li(ADC) exist as lithium acetylides Li(ACT). Exposure of Li(ACT) to CO2 and N2O readily afford ADC&#8208;compounds Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] and Li[(ADC)N2O], respectively.







Abstract
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts (IPr&#8208;Ar)X (1&#8208;Ar)X (IPr&#8208;Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Ar = Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (2&#8208;Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}2). 2&#8208;Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid&#8208;state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]n (3&#8208;Ar) dimeric (n = 2) or trimeric (n = 3) molecular structure for 2&#8208;Ar. Treatment of 3&#8208;Ph with Et3B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt3)] (4&#8208;Ph) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. 3&#8208;Ar readily undergo reactions with CO2 and N2O to form the ring&#8208;closing products Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] (5&#8208;Ar) and Li[(ADC)N2O] (6&#8208;Ar), respectively.

&lt;p&gt;The two-fold deprotonation of the C2-arylated 1,3-imidazolium salts (IPr-Ar)X (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-Ar)X (IPr-Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Ar = Ph, 4-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (DMP) or 4-PhC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Bp); Dipp = 2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;BuLi affords the so-called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid-state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;-Ar) dimeric (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) or trimeric (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3) molecular structure for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-Ar. Treatment of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;-Ph with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;-Ph) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;-Ar readily undergo reactions with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to form the ring-closing products Li[(ADC)(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;-Ar) and Li[(ADC)N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;-Ar), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borohydride Oxidation as Counter Reaction in Reductive Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, anodic borohydride oxidation is demonstrated to have great potential for successfully replacing sacrificial metal anodes in a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic counter reaction effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 at inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.







Abstract
An efficient reaction at the counter electrode is of key importance for the success of net oxidative and net reductive electrochemical transformations. For electrooxidative processes, cathodic proton reduction to H2 serves as the benchmark counter reaction. In contrast, net reductive electrochemical transformations have less attractive oxidative counter reactions to choose from and commonly rely on dissolution of a sacrificial anode that effectively results in stoichiometric metal consumption for the processes. In this study, we demonstrate that anodic borohydride oxidation has great potential to successfully replace the use of such sacrificial anodes for a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic transformation effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 using inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Dual Ammonia Activation and Transfer by an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Boryloxy Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the first single&#8208;site main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dual activation of ammonia (NH3) to hydrogen (H2) using a low&#8208;valent aluminyl compound. This transformation is driven by a (coordination/proton shuttling) N&#8722;H oxidative addition pathway and selective protonolysis. These findings highlight the potential of main&#8208;group complexes in traditionally transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated transformations.







Abstract
The reactivity of an N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al] reacts with excess NH3 to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] and in the process generates H2. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8722;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8722;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H2. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&#8722; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH2]&#8722; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO2 and Ph2CO) has been demonstrated.

         <title>Photogeneration and Visualization of a Surface&#8208;Stabilized Dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication we report the formation of a stable, surface&#8208;supported dinitrene achieved through the photolysis of a diazide precursor on an Au(111) metal substrate. We combine high&#8208;resolution scanning probe techniques with theoretical calculations, providing the first real&#8208;space imaging of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface and exploring the associated photoreaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.

         <title>Promoting the Kinetics of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via the Facet&#8208;Dependent Activation of Acetylene over Silver Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;dependent acetylene activation phenomenon over silver (Ag) catalysts is discovered, and Ag (100) is selected as a suitable candidate to increase the hydrogenation kinetics to improve the activity of ethylene electrosynthesis through the electrocatalytic acetylene conversion process. In addition, the activation of acetylene (C2H2) is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation, guiding future catalyst design.







Abstract
Metallic silver (Ag) sites exhibit a robust ability to suppress undesired C&#8722;C coupling in the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) into ethylene (ESAE), leading to satisfactory selectivity and stability. However, the relatively low reaction kinetics still hinder its practical value. Here, the facet&#8208;dependent ESAE performance is first evaluated to increase the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics and provide mechanistic insight for subsequent catalyst design. As a result, the Ag nanocubes with {100} surfaces demonstrate a partial current density of 337&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, greatly outperforming their counterparts with {111} surfaces exposed. Further comparisons of H2O splitting and C2H2 hydrogenation reveal that the activation of C2H2 is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of ethylene electrosynthesis. Additionally, experimental and theoretical mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that stronger C2H2 adsorption over the {100} surface strengthens the &#960; conjugation of C2H2, leading to the delocalization of &#960; electrons to promote the activation of C2H2 for enhanced hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Dynamic Ultralong Phosphorescence and Optical Waveguiding Switches in Silver&#8208;Organic Complex via Reversible Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 20, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal conversion and the heavy&#8208;atom effect, dynamically controllable ultralong phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable optical waveguide can be designed within an Ag&#8208;organic complex. This approach provides a straightforward way to expand room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence towards intelligent switches and Information storage.







Abstract
Dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light&#8208;emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)&#8208;organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Ag+ ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag&#8208;based complex displays reversible solvent&#8208;responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent&#8208;mediated single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color&#8208;tunable active optical waveguides and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polarization switching. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for creating dynamically controllable ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic complexes and advances the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive 1D photonic systems for promising information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is promoted by an engineered variant of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA), giving rise to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent enantiopurity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.

         <title>Fluorinated Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Robust Wetting Resistance for Durable Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising separation technique for producing pure water from brine using low&#8208;grade heat. Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with high porosity and well&#8208;ordered pore structure exhibit excellent flux and salt rejection during MD. However, long&#8208;term MD operation is often restricted by the inevitable gradual wetting of COF membranes which causes deterioration of salt rejection, primarily resulting from the lack of intrinsic hydrophobicity. Herein, a fluorinated COF membrane with intrinsic hydrophobicity and excellent anti&#8208;wetting property is reported. Under 65 &#176;C and 12 kPa absolute pressure, this membrane maintained a high water flux of 195 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and a salt rejection of 99.80% over 168 h of MD operation, which is the longest operation time ever reported for MD using COF membranes. In addition, the fluorinated COF membrane showed unparalleled resistance to scaling and organic fouling, demonstrating great potential for real&#8208;world brine treatment. Experimental and simulation studies revealed that incorporation of fluorine not only enhanced the hydrophobicity of the COF membrane, but also created electrostatic barriers within the fluorinated nanochannels, efficiently preventing ion penetration. These results underscore the remarkable potential of fluorinated COF membranes in MD, offering a promising solution for sustainable brine desalination.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling to Access Polysubstituted Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of cyclobutene remains inefficient due to inherent ring strain and poor regioselectivity. We demonstrate&#160;here a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between readily accessible homopropargyl halides and commercially available aryl/vinyl electrophiles for the direct access to polysubstituted cyclobutenes. This approach provides the first reductive 4&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, which paves the way for synthesis of diverse cyclobutene containing compounds (including synthetically challenging macrocycles). The synthesis of antitumor&#8208;active Combretastatin A&#8208;4 analog has been significantly optimized, the original six&#8208;step procedure yielding 14% has been streamlined into a three&#8208;steps process that achieves a markedly improved yield of 51%. Experimental data and computational studies support a mechanism involving an alkenyl nickel(I) intermediate, which undergoes facile back&#8208;side SH2 attack to produce the strained cyclobutene ring with overall stereo&#8208;inversion at the homopropargylic position.</dc:description>

         <title>Branched Alkyl Chains Tunable Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Manganese Halides for Anti&#8208;counterfeiting, White Light&#8208;emitting Diode and X&#8208;ray Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (Mn&#8208;based OIMHs) scintillators have aroused a research upsurge due to their outstanding photoluminescence performance, low toxicity, and tunable structures. Herein, we demonstrate a molecular engineering strategy that synergistically enhances luminescence efficiency and radiation sensitivity by systematic elongation of branched alkyl chains in phosphonium&#8208;based cations. The (4&#8208;DEATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DEATBP = (4&#8208;(diethylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) crystal exhibits remarkable thermochromic luminescence properties and anti&#8208;thermal quenching effect, highlighting the application potential in high&#8208;temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. Through effective chain elongation, the (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 (4&#8208;DBATBP = (4&#8208;(dibutylamino)butyl)triphenylphosphonium) single crystal achieves an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100% and exhibits superior performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation, with a high light yield of 67953 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 10.45 nGy s&#8722;1. Additionally, the glassy (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 demonstrates an impressive spatial resolution of 25 lp mm&#8722;1. (4&#8208;DBATBP)MnBr4 shows great application potential in the fields of white light&#8208;emitting diode (WLED) and express security check due to its outstanding luminescence performance. This work not only offers two kinds of new Mn&#8208;based OIMH materials but also authenticates the role of extending the branched alkyl chain for improving the photoluminescence performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroanionic Halogenated TiBTx MBene Protective Layer with Dual&#8208;Functional Zincophilic and Hydrophobic Characteristics for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hexagonal transition metal borides (h&#8208;MBenes), emerging members of 2D materials, demonstrate significant potential as protective layers for metal anodes. However, conventional MBenes synthesized by wet etching have massive oxygen&#8208;containing terminations imported during chemical synthesis process, with zincophobic and hydrophilic, resulting severe dendrite growth kinetics and compromising electrode performance. In this study, we report a novel hetero&#8208;halogen TiBTX (TX = Cl and I) h&#8208;MBenes through a halogen&#8208;radius&#8208;isomerization strategy, enabling precise mixed&#8208;halogen functionalization to create an ultrahigh zincophilic and hydrophobic microenvironment. Compared to single &#8208;I terminations, the mixed&#8208;halogen TiBTX exhibits significantly enhanced zincophilicity with ordered Zn2+ adsorption, attributed to the asymmetry&#8208;inductive effect of the larger&#8208;radius &#8208;I ions. Simultaneously, the &#8208;Cl moieties serve as a protective barrier, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion of the Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes. Notably, the dual&#8208;functional TiBTx&#8208;31 layer (TiBI0.32Cl0.13) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a prolonged cycling life exceeding 2000 hours an impressive average coulombic efficiency of 99.86%. Furthermore, the TiBTx&#8208;31@Zn||NVO full pouch cell maintains 95.3% capacity retention over 100 cycles. This work highlights the innovative halogen&#8208;radius&#8208;isomerization approach for interfacial engineering by tailoring halogen terminations, offering new insights for the development of high&#8208;performance h&#8208;MBenes&#8208;based energy storage devices.</dc:description>

In this study, we report a novel hetero-halogen TiBTX (TX = Cl and I) h-MBenes through a halogen-radius-isomerization strategy, enabling precise mixed-halogen functionalization to create an ultrahigh zincophilic and hydrophobic microenvironment. Compared to single -I terminations, the mixed-halogen TiBTX exhibits significantly enhanced zincophilicity with ordered Zn2+ adsorption, attributed to the asymmetry-inductive effect of the larger-radius -I ions. Simultaneously, the -Cl moieties serve as a protective barrier, mitigating water-induced corrosion of the Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Lipid Nanosonosensitizers with Size Reduction and NO Release: Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains difficult to treat due to its dense extracellular matrix (ECM), immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and deep&#8208;seated anatomy. To address these challenges, we developed IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer that synergizes sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for orthotopic PC. IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO undergoes three key US&#8208;activated responses: (1) size reduction, (2) controlled release of irinotecan (IR) and nitric oxide (NO), and (3) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under low&#8208;dose US, IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO reduces in size (from ~120 nm to ~40 nm), enhancing tumor penetration, and releases NO to remodel the TME by normalizing vasculature and degrading ECM. This enhances nanosonosensitizers accumulation and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) infiltration. High&#8208;dose US irradiation triggers the generation of cytotoxic ROS, which, in combination with IR&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and enhances antitumor immunity. Additionally, combining IR&amp;ZnPc@LNP&#8208;NO with PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) immunotherapy significantly prolongs survival in orthotopic PC models. The cascade strategy&#8212;size reduction, TME remodeling, and multimodal therapy&#8212;effectively overcomes stromal and immunosuppressive barriers, offering a robust platform for treating deep&#8208;seated PC.</dc:description>

         <title>Azuperylene: The Non&#8208;Alternant Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isoelectronic isomer of perylene, hereafter called as azuperylene, has been prepared. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the new isomer can be described as a union of two antiparallel azulenes in which the azulene&#8208;type aromatic character of the starting azulene is partially retained. Four 2,8&#8208;dialkoxy (i.e. ethoxy, n&#8208;butoxy, n&#8208;hexyloxy, n&#8208;octyloxy) functionalized derivatives of the new isomer core have been prepared. The solid&#8208;state structures of the new compounds have been resolved showing exceptional herringbone &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking ideal for charge transport. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors on sublimated substrates display an excellent hole transport mobility up to 1.03 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 which largely surpasses that of perylene and reveals the great potential for charge transport of this new class of non&#8208;benzenoid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Monolithium Monohydrogen Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins and their metal complexes play essential roles in biological and industrial processes, functioning as key components in catalysis, photodynamic therapy, and organic (opto&#8208;)electronic materials. Despite their significance, the intermediate states involved in metal incorporation into porphyrins remain poorly understood and are rarely observed as stable compounds. Here, we report the solvent&#8208;free synthesis of the first neutral alkali metal monohydrogen porphyrin, which was selectively obtained by reaction of lithium vapor with thin films of tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The resulting monolithium monohydrogen tetraphenyl&#173;porphy&#173;rin (LiHTPP) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and can be sublimated under UHV at 485 K without disproportionation, enabling its isolation. LiHTPP reacts with additional lithium to form dilithium tetraphenylporphyrin (Li2TPP), as confirmed through product analysis and reaction monitoring via photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Complementary theoretical simulations provide deeper insight into the chemical structure of this non&#8208;planar complex and the energetics of its formation. This study advances the understanding of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins and their role in metalation pathways, introducing a novel synthetic route for stable intermediates. The study also underscores the potential of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins for developing catalysts and electronic materials with tunable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Supramolecular Language Processing for Co&#8208;crystal Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approximately 40% of marketed drugs exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles. Co&#8208;crystallization, where pairs of molecules form a multicomponent crystal, constitutes a promising strategy to enhance physicochemical properties without compromising pharmacological activity. However, finding promising co&#8208;crystal pairs is resource&#8208;intensive, due to the large and diverse range of possible molecular combinations. We present DeepCocrystal, a novel deep learning approach designed to predict co&#8208;crystal formation by processing the "chemical language" from a supramolecular vantage point. Rigorous validation of DeepCocrystal showed a balanced accuracy of 78% in realistic scenarios, outperforming existing models. Explainable AI approaches uncovered the decision&#8208;making process of DeepCocrystal, showing its capability to learn chemically relevant aspects of the "supramolecular language" that match experimental co&#8208;crystallization patterns. By leveraging properties of molecular string representations, DeepCocrystal can also estimate the uncertainty of its predictions. We harness this capability in a challenging prospective study and successfully discovered two novel co&#8208;crystals of diflunisal, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. This study underscores the potential of deep learning &#8212; and in particular of chemical language processing &#8212; to accelerate co&#8208;crystallization and ultimately drug development, in both academic and industrial contexts.&#160;DeepCocrystal is available as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use web application at https://deepcocrystal.streamlit.app/.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Lipid Metabolism Dynamics in Physiological/Pathological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dysregulated lipid metabolism plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, due to the lack of effective solutions, the dynamic monitoring and deep understanding of lipid metabolism in the progression of diseases has remained challenging. Herein, a polarity&#8208;sensitive, lipid droplets (LDs)&#8208;targeted probe was developed via molecular surgery for spatiotemporal super&#8208;resolution imaging of lipid metabolism dynamics. Based on the stimulated emission depletion (STED) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) platform, we achieved the super&#8208;resolution visualization and dynamic tracking of the nonlinear fusion and expansion mechanisms of LDs in orthotopic pathology models&#8212;an unprecedented achievement in the field. We also analyzed lipid distribution in zebrafish models using the STED&#8208;FLIM platform to capture lipid metabolism at the organismal level. Crucially, based on the integrated STED&#8208;FLIM platform, this probe accurately monitors lipid metabolism in cellular and pathological tissue contexts of atherosclerosis and fatty liver. This breakthrough provides novel insights for diagnosing lipid metabolism&#8208;related diseases and advancing therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Proton&#8208;Feeding Retards the Deprotonation for Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite&#160;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have shown great potential in the application of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their large exciton binding energy, tunable bandgaps and solution processability. However, the heavily used spacer cations will cause serious deprotonation reactions in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, leading to lattice collapse and abundant defect states, which is notorious for fabricating efficient perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Herein, we develop an in situ proton&#8208;feeding strategy to restrain the deprotonation process in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites by introducing a proton&#8208;rich Lewis base, namely trifluoromethyl nicotinic acid (TFNA), into the perovskite precursor solutions. The TFNA molecules can donate protons during the growth of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films to simultaneously compensate the deprotonated spacer cations, passivate the defects states by coordinating with Pb2+ and improve structural stability by forming hydrogen bonds with organic spacers. This leads to an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 78.8%. The resulting red&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 27.5% at 660 nm, accompanied by a 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement of the operational lifetime (T50) compared to that of the reference device based on pristine perovskite. This work deepens the understanding of the crystallization of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films and provides a new avenue to improve the PeLEDs performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[8]arene&#8208;Tethered Dendritic Octamer Acceptor with Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Enables 20.7% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the molecular weight of the acceptor is an effective strategy to suppress excessive crystallization and molecular diffusion, thereby addressing morphological challenges in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, designing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptor with well&#8208;defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs&#160;towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene&#8208;tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g/mol and a well&#8208;defined structure.&#160;Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates multidimensional charge transport and enhances both molecular interactions, C8&#8208;IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8&#8208;BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors.&#160;Besides, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature (Tg), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved&#160;device stability. This work presents high&#8208;performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecule weight&#160;and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly&#160;stable OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Construction of Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Pentacyclic Scaffolds via Double Dearomative Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutane&#8208;fused polycyclic scaffolds are structurally interesting cores in natural product synthesis and drug discovery. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort and gives low efficiency. We herein demonstrated the divergent construction of various cyclobutane&#8208;fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds by a photocatalytic intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes. These skeletons, typically unattainable under thermal conditions, could be accessed with exclusive diastereoselectivity under mild photochemical conditions. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroalkylation, alkene isomerization, and [2+2] cycloaddition via an intertwined single electron transfer (SET)/energy transfer (EnT) nature. This protocol provided a divergent synthetic approach for constructing (pseudo)&#8208;dimeric cyclobutane&#8208;fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition between naphthalenes and benzothiophenes was also realized, providing indispensable methods for unprecedented structurally diverse polycyclic molecules that were difficult to access by conventional transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Bicarbonate Electrolysis to Formate Enabled via Ionomer Surface Modification in Cation Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising method for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals, with formate being a particularly viable product. However, current gas&#8208;fed CO2RR systems rely on highly pure CO2 feed gases and are incompatible with point&#8208;source CO2 emissions without prior capture and concentration. Bicarbonate electrolysis offers a potential solution by bridging the gap between CO2 emissions and utilization. However, existing electrolyzer configurations, especially those using bipolar membranes (BPM), require high working voltages and suffer from poor energy efficiency. Here, we present a cation exchange membrane (CEM)&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) incorporating a surface&#8208;modified bismuth cathode catalyst. The success of this approach is attributed to two key factors: the use of the positively charged ionomer PiperION for surface modification, which creates a favorable cathode microenvironment; the single CEM that enhances proton flux from the anode to the cathode while reducing ionic impedance. The CEM&#8208;based MEA demonstrates a formate Faradaic efficiency of up to 80%, with a significant 1 V reduction in operating voltage compared to BPM&#8208;based MEAs at 300 mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, the CEM&#8208;based MEA exhibits excellent tolerance to O2 impurities and maintains high performance even with simulated flue gas, making it suitable for direct CO2 utilization from point&#8208;source.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Manganese Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) holds tremendous potential for remediating NO3&#8722; pollution in groundwater while enabling clean ammonia (NH3) production. However, most catalysts achieve high conversion efficiency relying on high NO3&#8722; concentrations. How to catalyze the NO3&#8722;RR with low concentration of NO3&#8722; is still a challenge due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To address this limitation, we constructed a novel asymmetric isolated Mn atom based on N&#8208;coordination covalent organic framework (COF) (ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn), for efficient NO3&#8722;RR at a low NO3&#8722; concentration of 2 mg mL&#8722;1. This bidentate&#8208;coordinated COF featured a robust and chemically stable framework, while the synergistic interaction between asymmetric imine N and pyridine N modified the charge distribution of Mn atoms to optimize catalytic efficiency. ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, with 95.64% NH3 selectivity and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 1927 mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1, exceeding the corresponding parameters of symmetric Mn sitesby factors of 1.27 and 1.41, respectively. In situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements and theoretical calculations revealed that the asymmetric isolated Mn facilitated a reduction in the energy barrier for *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH conversion, and thus contributed to higher activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe Confined into MnO Nanoclusters Enhances Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts are promising alternatives to expensive noble metals for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we present a simple metal&#8208;atom localization strategy to confine the atomically dispersed Fe into MnO nanoclusters, which are dispersed and immobilized on high&#8208;conductivity carbon support (MF/CN). The experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the trace Fe(III) ions doped into MnO nanoclusters can induce charge transfer and spin state transition to trigger a butterfly effect, obtaining abundant active Mn(III) with single&#8208;electron eg configuration and strengthened built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), which is greatly helpful to balance the adsorption and desorption of ORR O&#8208;containing intermediates, facilitate the interfacial electron transfer, and improve the electrical conductivity. As a result, the optimized MF0.04/CN exhibits compelling alkaline ORR activity (half&#8208;wave potential 0.79 V vs RHE) and stability (nearly 100% current retention rate for 30 h). Finally, the MF0.04/CN realizes a remarkable power density (138 mW cm&#8208;2) and durability (&gt; 666 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This finding not only helps to design high&#8208;performance metal oxide heterointerfaces by tuning eg orbital occupancy and BIEF strength, but also deepens the understanding of the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemistry&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Primary Alkyl&#8208;alkoxylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono&#8208; or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;Ring Intramolecular Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a novel SAM molecular design strategy by introducing fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions. The designed molecule, JJ32, features a benzo[5,6][1,4]thiazino[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline skeleton, where strong D&#8211;A interactions enhance charge delocalization and downshift the LUMO energy level. This leads to enhanced photostability, redox stability, and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, the improved redox stability benefits the promising polyoxometalate/SAM composite HSL, allowing the JJ32/HPWO&#8208;based OSC to reach 19.85% efficiency with improved stability.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these molecules frequently exhibit a shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, rendering them prone to photodegradation.&#160;To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8211;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included in polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs), resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.85% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8211;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Desolventization and Lithium&#8208;Rich Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with lithiophilic sites and hydrogen bond interaction with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) can accelerate the desolvation process of lithium ion and guide the rapid and uniform deposition of Li+.








Abstract
Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C&#9552;O, C&#9552;N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11&#160;000&#160;h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A Biodegradable Radical Polymer Enables High&#8208;Performance, Physically Transient Organic Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable radical polymer with intrinsic memristivity and on&#8208;demand physical transience is presented. We leverage the nonconjugated nature of the radical polymer for a systematic molecular engineering. The polymer enabled a high&#8208;performance organic memristive device comparable to inorganic transient memory devices, now equipped with additional functionalities including optical transparency, flexibility, biocompatibility, and the transience.








Abstract
Electronic devices often demand high reliability and longevity, but they also contribute significantly to electronic waste. Physically transient electronics have thus emerged as a promising alternative in future electronics, particularly in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. In these applications, memristive materials have gained significant attention for their potential to realize neuromorphic systems that offer energy&#8208;efficient, hardware&#8208;based parallel processing. By integrating memristive capabilities with transient behavior, this study bridges these two cutting&#8208;edge fields, creating materials that not only enable advanced computing but also dissociate sustainably. Additionally, we leverage the unique features of soft materials for their tunability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, which collectively enhance this integration. In this work, we first illustrate molecular engineering strategy on a radical polymer. We then proceed to two&#8208;terminal devices therefrom, which exhibit exceptional memory performance of &gt;106 on/off ratio, &gt;104 s state retention, and stability over 250 DC sweep cycles. A flexible, optically transparent, and physically transient crossbar arrays are also developed, which maintain the performance through &gt;3,000 bending cycles and fully dissociate in water at room temperature. This work represents an advancement toward a biorealistic platform with substantial multifunctionality, making it readily translatable to future wearable and implantable neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport Through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes Toward High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Loading Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. The composite gel polymer electrolyte facilitates high&#8208;performance Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cell. 








Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt;4.0&#160;V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What's more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Specially, cells with 8.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.
