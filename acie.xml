         <title>Selective N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Peptides and Proteins Using Fatty Acyl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective modification of peptides and proteins is vital for their development as therapeutics. Here, the adenylation domain of a carboxylic acid reductase enzyme from Segniliparus rugosus (CARsr&#8208;A) was used to generate reactive acyl adenylates in situ from carboxylic acids. Functionalized and simple fatty acids were incorporated with excellent selectivity at the N&#8208;termini of therapeutically relevant peptides and proteins.








Abstract
The selective modification of proteins and peptides is an important chemical biology tool with a wide variety of applications, including the production of biopharmaceuticals or the study of post&#8208;translational modifications. In particular, the selective acylation of the N&#8208;terminus over side chains in peptides and proteins is a highly desirable but challenging reaction in this field. Current methods have a range of shortcomings, including lack of selectivity or narrow substrate scope. Here we report a biomimetic approach using the in situ enzymatic reagent activation (ERA) of carboxylic acids with ATP to generate acyl&#8208;adenosine monophosphates. This method displays high selectivity for the N&#8208;termini of peptides and proteins, including pharmaceutically relevant liraglutide, glucagon and insulin. The ERA acylation tolerates a broad range of unsubstituted and substituted fatty acids, including azido and dicarboxylic acids, thus making it suitable for N&#8208;terminal bioorthogonal labelling strategies. Moreover, this strategy can also be applied to the modification of antibodies. In general, the ERA acylation is a versatile and bioorthogonal method that we envisage finding wider applications in the field of bioconjugation and the production of stable peptide and protein conjugates.

         <title>Catalytic 1,2&#8208; and 1,1&#8208;Carbocyclization of Alkenes Employing Adamantanols as Tertiary Carbocation Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the challenge of utilizing tertiary carbocations in catalytic electrophilic cyclization. A Br&#248;nsted acid system facilitates efficient 1,2&#8208; or formal 1,1&#8208;addition of adamantyl cations to various alkenes, yielding adamantylated heterocycles with high selectivity. DFT calculations indicate that the stabilized, moderate electrophilicity of the adamantyl cation and the effect of the nucleophilic tether are key to the success.








Abstract
Catalytic alkene cyclization initiated by carbon electrophiles represents an emerging strategy for constructing valuable and challenging molecular architectures. However, due to reactivity issues, the realization of such reactions with tertiary carbon electrophiles remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an efficient Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed system that overcomes this limitation. Using 1&#8208;adamantanols as precursors of tertiary carbocation electrophiles, and through TfOH catalysis, alkenes tethered with carboxyl, sulfonamide, and hydroxyl groups, including those with relatively low reactivity such as alkyl&#8208;substituted and terminal alkenes, can be converted into a variety of adamantylated heterocycles in hexafluoroisopropanol with good yields via 1,2&#8208;addition or formal 1,1&#8208;addition, with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The products serve as versatile synthetic building blocks and can be readily transformed into valuable adamantyl&#8208;containing compounds, including derivatives with anti&#8208;influenza A activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments indicate that the moderate electrophilicity of the adamantyl carbocation and the hyperconjugative effect of the adamantyl group in stabilizing carbocations form the basis for achieving the electrophilic cyclization. Additionally, they also reveal that different nucleophilic groups can influence the progression of the reaction. These findings provide references for the design of new electrophilic reactions.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;Oxy Melonine Enabled by an Intramolecular Alkene Diamination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complexity&#8208;generating intramolecular alkene diamination constitutes the pivotal step in the enantioselective synthesis of the title natural products featuring a strained, cage&#8208;like pentacyclic architecture. 








Abstract
Among more than four thousand monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) isolated to date, only a few feature a 2,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted indoline moiety. (+)&#8208;Melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;oxy melonine possess a highly rearranged carbon framework, presumably arising from cyclization of a rearranged iminium ion of quebrachamine precursor. We report herein the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;melonine and (+)&#8208;N4&#8208;oxy melonine featuring: a) a highly enantioselective CBS reduction followed by a stereospecific Johnson&#8208;Claisen rearrangement for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;substituted &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ester; b) Bower's bis&#8208;cyclizative diamination of alkene, enabling the conversion of a functionalized cycloheptene to the tetracyclic core of the natural products; and c) an AlMe3&#8208;mediated lactamization that concurrently achieves desymmetrization at the C20 prochiral center.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimulus Triggered Programmable Transformation of Molecular Motor Based Chiral Supramolecular Polymers in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report aldehyde motor&#8211;based chiral supramolecular polymers that exhibit light and chemically driven dual responsiveness in water. The supramolecular polymers show transformation and amplification of multi&#8208;state chirality into diverse geometries, offering dynamic control of supramolecular chirality and architectures.








Abstract
A notable characteristic of living organisms is their capacity to adapt to environmental changes and transform external signals into distinct responsiveness, facilitating the execution of diverse functions with motility as a key parameter. To better mimic such lifelike behavior, researchers have developed various supramolecular assembled systems with responsive behavior toward a variety of stimuli. However, exploiting motion along length scales and achieving collective control over the responsiveness to multiple stimuli in supramolecular systems is still challenging. Here we present the development of molecular motor based supramolecular polymers that are responsive toward multi&#8208;stimulus and exhibit multi&#8208;state assembly and chirality. Taking advantages of aldehyde functionalized motors, we realized photo&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers featuring boosted photo&#8208;efficiency, near quantitative photoconversions, programmable behavior and responsiveness to multiple stimuli in a reversible manner in aqueous media. The various stimuli including light and different chemicals could act on the motor building blocks and subsequently trigger the transformation of the supramolecular polymers toward reversible polymerization, direct post&#8208;functionalization and chirality modulation. The interplay between the rotary molecular motion and the supramolecular systems assembly process, taking advantage of different external stimuli to govern the assembly state, provides a basis for multi&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials

         <title>Surface Hydroxyl Network Promoted Hydrogen Transfer Dynamics for Efficient Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism is realized in photocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over the hydroxyl&#8208;modified carbon nitride (C3N4&#8208;OH)/Ni(OH)2 composite. The hydroxyl network provides a strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment to adsorb interfacial water and accelerate hydrogen transfer dynamics.








Abstract
Photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) is seriously limited by the inefficient generation and directional transfer of active hydrogen species. Here, we report a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism for photocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over hydroxyl&#8208;modified carbon nitride (C3N4&#8208;OH)/Ni(OH)2 composite. Such a hydroxyl network not only enhances photogenerated charge separation but also establishes a strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment for adsorbing interfacial water and facilitating hydrogen transfer dynamics. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, in situ photochemical infrared spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and active hydrogen (H*)&#8208;trapping reveal that the fast proton transfer via a PCET mechanism, rather than a conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway. Eventually, the C3N4&#8208;Ni(OH)2 achieves an exceptionally high C2H4 production rate of 15.7&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a C2H4 selectivity of 98.2% under simulated solar irradiation. For purifying a crude C2H4 stream containing 0.5&#160;vol% C2H2, the C2H2 conversion remains &#8764;98% over a long&#8208;term continuous&#8208;flow operation. This work elucidates the pivotal role of surface hydroxyl networks in governing hydrogen kinetics and paves a new avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

The hydroxyl network provides a strong hydrogen-bonding microenvironment to adsorb interfacial water and accelerate hydrogen transfer dynamics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic semi-hydrogenation of acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is seriously limited by the inefficient generation and directional transfer of active hydrogen species. Here, we report a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism for photocatalytic acetylene semi-hydrogenation by establishing a hydroxyl network over hydroxyl-modified carbon nitride (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-OH)/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite. Such a hydroxyl network not only enhances photogenerated charge separation but also establishes a strong hydrogen-bonding microenvironment for adsorbing interfacial water and facilitating hydrogen transfer dynamics. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy, in situ photochemical infrared spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and active hydrogen (H*)-trapping reveal that the fast proton transfer via a PCET mechanism, rather than a conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway. Eventually, the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; achieves an exceptionally high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 15.7&#160;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 98.2% under simulated solar irradiation. For purifying a crude C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; stream containing 0.5&#160;vol% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion remains &#8764;98% over a long-term continuous-flow operation. This work elucidates the pivotal role of surface hydroxyl networks in governing hydrogen kinetics and paves a new avenue for the design of high-performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paired&#8208;Cell Ammonia over Black CoWO4 via Electrocatalysis&#8211;Acidification Cascade from Wastewater at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired NO3RR&#8208;UOR system using bifunctional oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich black CoWO4 achieves unprecedented bipolar NH3 production with an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 173.12% and an NH3 yield rate of 9.43&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. 








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) offers a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, its practical implementation is limited by the sluggish and energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Herein, we report a strategically designed paired&#8208;electrolysis system coupling NO3RR with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), followed by chemical acidification, to establish an economical route of bipolar ammonia (NH3) production, using a black CoWO4 (B&#8208;CoWO4) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) as the electrocatalyst. B&#8208;CoWO4 shows a record&#8208;breaking performance with a current density of &#8764;1.25 A cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Combined spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal a &#8220;fill&#8208;restore&#8221; cycle of OVs during NO3RR: oxygen from NO3&#8722; incorporates into the OVs, which are subsequently restored after the formation of NH3. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the OVs modify the electronic structure of the catalyst and facilitate the formation of key intermediate (NO3H*). Importantly, in the coupled NO3RR||UOR flow&#8208;cell system, B&#8208;CoWO4 delivers an apparent bipolar NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 173.12% and a production rate of 9.43&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This integrated strategy boosts overall energy efficiency and enables simultaneous valorization of nitrate&#8208;contaminated water and urea&#8208;rich wastewater streams.

         <title>Electrochemical Degradation of Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonates via Sulfonate to Carboxylate Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel approach for the degradation of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) involving a controlled, electromediated, sulfonate&#8208;to&#8208;carboxylate headgroup conversion. We apply this method to shorter chain PFSAs and provide key mechanistic insights that contribute to a broader understanding of the molecular pathways underlying pollutant degradation and highlight the power of organic electrochemistry in addressing environmental challenges.








Abstract
Efficient, scalable, and well&#8208;understood methods for degrading per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are essential for limiting their numerous negative human health and environmental effects. Electrochemical methods are promising for PFAS degradation but are currently not yet well developed for use in non&#8208;aqueous conditions relevant for PFAS sorbent regeneration without resorting to specialized electrode materials. Herein, we report the mediated electrochemical conversion of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates to carboxylates using commercial Pt electrodes in acetonitrile. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was converted primarily to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) alongside several shorter&#8208;chain carboxylates through a proposed radical desulfonation and hydroxide coupling process explored in a detailed mechanistic study. Following the near&#8208;complete conversion of PFOS to perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, all species are mineralized to fluoride and non&#8208;fluorinated carbon byproducts using established low&#8208;temperature DMSO/NaOH conditions. HPLC&#8208;MS, ion chromatography, and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods determined a significant loss in fluorine and carbon balance after electrochemistry, which we attribute to the production of volatile byproducts. This degradation approach provides new insights into PFAS degradation mechanisms under highly oxidative, non&#8208;aqueous conditions and highlights the potential for organic electrochemistry to address environmental challenges by promoting controlled and selective destruction pathways for common organic pollutants.

         <title>M&#8211;O&#8211;C Catalysts: Copper Single Atoms Supported on Oxocarbon Covalent Networks as Electrocatalysts for Glycerol Oxidation to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a new class of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts based on oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in oxocarbon networks (M&#8211;O&#8211;C), alternative to traditional M&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. A Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C catalyst derived from oxocarbon precursors exhibits highly dispersed Cu single atoms and delivers faster glycerol oxidation kinetics and higher formate selectivity than conventional Cu&#8208;based and Cu&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.








Abstract
N&#8208;doped carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) have emerged as some of the most efficient electrocatalysts, offering both high activity and selectivity. To date, stabilization of single atoms on conductive carbon has been achieved almost exclusively through coordination with nitrogen atoms. Here, we introduce copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (Cu SACs) uniquely coordinated by oxygen within a stable oxocarbon network derived from tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ)&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;organic frameworks. By thermal condensation with MgCl2&#183;6H2O at 600 &#176;C, we achieve an oxygen&#8208;rich carbonaceous material (30 wt% O) hosting highly dispersed Cu atoms. Advanced electron microscopic, spectroscopic, and scattering techniques, including high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), pair distribution functions (PDF), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), provide definitive experimental evidence of predominant Cu&#8211;O coordination, distinguishing these catalysts (M&#8211;O&#8211;C) from conventional nitrogen&#8208;coordinated SACs. The resulting Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C catalyst exhibits high selectivity (85% Faradaic efficiency) for electrochemical glycerol oxidation into formic acid under alkaline conditions, outperforming traditional Cu&#8208;based systems. In comparison with traditional Cu&#8211;N&#8211;C system, Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C shows faster reactions kinetic, arising from unique Lewis basicity of oxygen coordination, facilitating electron&#8208;proton transfer reactions. This study not only pioneers Cu&#8211;O&#8211;C SACs but also introduces oxocarbons as promising supports, offering novel pathways for designing highly efficient single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Dual Catalytic Sites Enable Asymmetric C&#9472;C Coupling for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW catalyst was successfully developed with precisely engineered Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu sites, achieving a maximum FEethanol of 57.3% in CO2RR. Combined 13CO2&#160;+&#160;12CO co&#8208;feed experiments and a collection of operando/in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity originates from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO (generated at in&#8208;situ formed LS Fe(II) sites) and *CHO (formed at O&#8208;bridged Cu sites).








Abstract
Understanding C&#9472;C coupling pathways is essential for achieving selective CO2 conversion into multi&#8208;carbon products. However, controlling intermediates dimerization remains highly challenging due to both the complexity of the catalytic systems and the limited mechanistic knowledge into the C&#9472;C coupling process. In this work, a model dual&#8208;site catalyst with precisely configured Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu sites is designed by covalently grafting iron&#8208;phthalocyanine (FePc) onto copper nanowires via oxygen bridges (FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW), which enables probing of atomic&#8208;level mechanistic insights into the C&#9472;C coupling pathways during electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Remarkably, the FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW exhibits a 23.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio as compared to O&#8208;Cu NW, achieving&#160;&gt;&#160;80% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at an industrially relevant current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2. 13CO2/12CO co&#8208;feed experiments together with a collection of operando/in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity over FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Cu NW arises from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO and *CHO intermediates, where *CO is generated at the low&#8208;spin single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom site, while *CHO is produced at the oxygen&#8208;bridged Cu site. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further unveil that the oxygen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Cu site can not only stabilize the in situ generated low&#8208;spin Fe(II) active site for enhancing CO2 activation and lowering *CO desorption energy but also construct an oxygen&#8208;bridged Cu active site to stabilize the *OCHO intermediate, significantly lowering the *OCHO&#8208;to&#8208;*CHO conversion energy barrier, orchestrating an efficient asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling path and boosting the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.

&lt;p&gt;FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW catalyst was successfully developed with precisely engineered Fe-O-Cu sites, achieving a maximum FE&lt;sub&gt;ethanol&lt;/sub&gt; of 57.3% in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding C&#9472;C coupling pathways is essential for achieving selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into multi-carbon products. However, controlling intermediates dimerization remains highly challenging due to both the complexity of the catalytic systems and the limited mechanistic knowledge into the C&#9472;C coupling process. In this work, a model dual-site catalyst with precisely configured Fe-O-Cu sites is designed by covalently grafting iron-phthalocyanine (FePc) onto copper nanowires via oxygen bridges (FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW), which enables probing of atomic-level mechanistic insights into the C&#9472;C coupling pathways during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Remarkably, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW exhibits a 23.6-fold enhancement in the ethanol-to-ethylene Faradaic efficiency ratio as compared to O-Cu NW, achieving&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;80% C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency at an industrially relevant current density of 1&#160;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO co-feed experiments together with a collection of &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt;/in-situ characterizations reveal that the enhanced ethanol selectivity over FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O-Cu NW arises from asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling between *CO and *CHO intermediates, where *CO is generated at the low-spin single-Fe-atom site, while *CHO is produced at the oxygen-bridged Cu site. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further unveil that the oxygen-bridged Fe-O-Cu site can not only stabilize the in situ generated low-spin Fe(II) active site for enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and lowering *CO desorption energy but also construct an oxygen-bridged Cu active site to stabilize the *OCHO intermediate, significantly lowering the *OCHO-to-*CHO conversion energy barrier, orchestrating an efficient asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling path and boosting the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetraaza[7]&#8211;[15]helicenes Synthesized by Two&#8208;Step Strategy: Length&#8208;Controlled Chiral &#960;&#8208;Systems Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

A modular two&#8208;step strategy provides tetraaza[n]helicenes (n&#160;=&#160;7&#8211;15) as a homologous series with tunable photophysical and chiroptical properties. Extension beyond n&#160;=&#160;11 induces pronounced through&#8208;space &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, narrowing the energy gap and amplifying circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Helicenes are chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules whose properties strongly depend on their lengths. Systematic studies of these compounds have been limited by synthetic challenges. Here we report a concise two&#8208;step strategy (defined as the helicene&#8208;forming sequence from aminohelicene precursors) to access a homologous series of tetraaza[7]&#8211;[15]helicenes. Optical spectra converge beyond [11]H, defining a conjugation ceiling, while chiroptical responses amplify sharply, yielding |glum| up to 0.028. Fluorescence quantum yields show a nonmonotonic dependence, with [7]H and [15]H maintaining both high &#934;F (0.39 and 0.36) and large |glum|, resulting in outstanding, albeit semi&#8208;quantitative, CPL performance, with figures of merit reaching 0.010 and CPL brightness values of approximately 490. TD&#8208;DFT calculations attribute this amplification to the delayed alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipoles, while 1H NMR shifts of inner protons provide an independent probe of structural reorganization within the helical cavity. Additionally, experiment and theory have consistently identified [11]H as the critical helicene length at which the framework undergoes a qualitative transition. Notably, the [15]helicene constitutes the longest helicene ever resolved into its enantiomers, underscoring the synthetic power of this modular approach. Importantly, our synthetic route is effective for constructing higher&#8208;order helicenes, offering a generalizable platform for length&#8208;controlled, heteroatom&#8208;containing helicenes. These findings establish long tetraazahelicenes as a rare platform where through&#8208;bond conjugation and through&#8208;space orbital coupling act cooperatively to govern photophysical and chiroptical properties.

         <title>Non&#8208;Statistical Assembly of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cages for Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor functionalized cages [Pd2D2A2]4+ with defined stoichiometry and stereoconfiguration were assembled in a single step by employing the shape complementary assembly (SCA) strategy. While the redox functionalities remain largely independent in the ground state, photoexcitation results in ultrafast ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, as unraveled by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and transient absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
We report light&#8208;triggered charge separation in two discrete supramolecular architectures that self&#8208;assemble in a single step from donor (D) and acceptor (A) functionalized bridging ligands and Pd(II) cations. The &#8220;shape complementary assembly&#8221; (SCA) strategy allows for exclusive formation of the cis&#8208;[Pd2D2A2]4+ cage isomer. Compared to previously reported statistical DA assemblies, lacking stoichiometry and stereo control, the number of possible electron transfer routes was reduced. This enables a better understanding and tunability of the excited state dynamics. Cage assembly was investigated by NMR, MS, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Steady&#8208;state absorption and electrochemical properties indicate that donor and acceptor moieties remain largely independent in the electronic ground state. Femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in the visible and infrared was applied to compare the fate of photoexcited states for pure ligands, donor&#8208; and acceptor&#8208;only assemblies, and the donor&#8211;acceptor heteroleptic cages. For the latter, ultrafast intracage ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge separation is followed by two back electron transfer pathways, occurring on timescales of hundreds of picoseconds and around one nanosecond, assignable to D/A ligands facing each other in cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;position. Our work shows that non&#8208;statistical modular self&#8208;assembly can be used for the precise positioning of photoredox&#8208;active components in defined distances on the nanoscale.

Oxidatively stable benzoyl&#8208;fused peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene ribbons with NIR emission were synthesized. Their good spectral overlap enabled cascaded F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) antennae in a nematic liquid crystal phase, achieving directional energy transfer. The final light&#8208;harvesting system exhibits a two&#8208;step FRET efficiency of 0.70 and extended visible absorption, providing efficient panchromatic light&#8208;harvesting capability.








Abstract
In this work, we present a modular donor&#8211;acceptor strategy that produces oxidatively stable, benzoyl&#8208;fused peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX) ribbons with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and light&#8208;harvesting properties. Benzoyl fusion at the pseudo&#8208;peri positions, achieved through intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts planarization, creates the first benzoyl&#8208;functionalized PXX monomers, dimers, and trimers that exhibit deep red&#8211;NIR absorption and emission without significantly raising the HOMO level. The ribbons display strong, tunable absorption and fluorescence bands, with up to 63% of emission in the NIR and an NIR fluorescence quantum yield&#160;reaching 0.36 in solution. Lewis adducts formed between boron&#8208;based Lewis acids and carbonyl acceptor sites further enhance the electron&#8208;accepting nature of the ketones, producing pure NIR emission (&#934;FNIR$\mathit{\Phi}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{NIR}}$ &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.16). Spectroelectrochemical investigations uncover reversible electrochromism and electrofluorochromism, allowing&#160;redox&#8208;gated switching and NIR absorption signatures, useful for sensing and display technologies. When embedded in a nematic liquid crystal phase, the ribbons function as cascaded F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) antennas, achieving near&#8208;quantitative single&#8208;step energy transfer (&#934;$\mathit{\Phi}$FRET&#160;=&#160;0.97) and highly efficient two&#8208;step transfer (&#934;$\mathit{\Phi}$FRET&#160;=&#160;0.70), enabling directional energy funneling. Their complementary absorption broadens the excitation window to cover the entire visible spectrum, making them highly efficient panchromatic light&#8208;harvesting materials.

         <title>Pore Space Multi&#8208;Layer Functionalization Boosting Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture with Record Capacity and Exceptional Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of the pore space multiple&#8208;layer functionalization (PSMLF) strategy significantly enhances pore space utilization compared to traditional pore surface functionalization methods. Utilizing this strategy, PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM achieves a record&#8208;high iodine uptake of 88.58&#160;wt% and exhibits remarkable kinetics (k1&#160;=&#160;0.025&#160;min&#8722;1), surpassing all previously reported benchmark adsorbents under industrial conditions.








Abstract
Capturing radioactive molecular iodine (I2) from nuclear waste under industrial conditions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we developed for the first time a pore space multiple&#8208;layer functionalization (PSMLF) strategy, which enables directionally distribute functional sites across the multi&#8208;layer regions of large pore space, thereby enhancing the I2 adsorption ability by optimizing pore space utilization. Utilizing this approach, the optimized adsorbent PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM achieves a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 88.58&#160;wt% under simulated industrial conditions (150&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;ppmv I2), a 108&#8208;fold improvement over its parent material, PAF&#8208;1. This performance significantly surpasses that of industrial Ag@MOR and all previously benchmarked adsorbents under the same conditions. Furthermore, adsorption kinetic of PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM (k1&#160;=&#160;0.025 min&#8722;1) are significantly higher than those of all other porous adsorbents reported to date. These results thus establish PAF&#8208;1&#8208;NTM as a new benchmark for high&#8208;temperature I2 adsorbents. Mechanism investigation reveals a new insight that the I2 adsorption capacity is positively correlated with the pore space utilization rate. Our work not only develops a promising adsorbent for industrial radioactive I2 capture but also establishes a general design principle for creating high&#8208;temperature I2 adsorbents suitable for practical applications.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Antigenicity Evaluation of an O&#8208;Antigen Octadecasaccharide from Helicobacter pylori</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic total synthesis of the H. pylori SS1 O&#8208;antigen octadecasaccharide was achieved by stereoconvergent [6&#160;+&#160;4] assembly and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;controlled enzymatic site&#8208;specific fucosylation. Glycan microarray screening of the synthetic O&#8208;antigen and its fragments identified a simpler antigenic epitope, providing a key target for glycoconjugate vaccine design.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection represents a major global health challenge, characterized by high prevalence, significant association with gastric cancer, and rising antibiotic resistance. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines targeting the O&#8208;antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present a promising alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapies. To explore the immunogenicity of LPS O&#8208;antigen from clinical isolate H. pylori SS1, we report an integrated chemoenzymatic strategy for the first synthesis of its octadecasaccharide O&#8208;antigen and related fragments for antigenicity evaluation. Our strategy features modular chemical synthesis of a decasaccharide precursor containing a high&#8208;carbon sugar (D,D&#8208;Hep) residue, a unique oligomeric &#946;1,2&#8208;linked ribofuranosyl tetrasaccharide motif and a switchable glucosamine (GlcNH2) residue through stereoconvergent [6&#160;+&#160;4] assembly, followed by protecting&#8208;group&#8208;controlled enzymatic elongation to precisely install hybrid Lewis antigen moiety (Ley&#8208;Lex) in a site&#8208;specific fucosylation manner to afford the target octadecasaccharide bearing five challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Chemical stereoselective construction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic and 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosidic linkages was accomplished by reagent&#8208;controlled glycosylation and 4&#8208;O&#8208;acyl remote participation, respectively. Enzymatic site&#8208;specific installation of the remaining three 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;fucosidic linkages was achieved using two robust fucosyltransferases and a strategically designed GlcNH2 residue. Glycan microarray&#8208;based screening of the synthetic O&#8208;antigen and its subunits with H. pylori&#8208;infected patient sera identified an undecasaccharide as a simpler and key epitope for vaccine development.

In this report, we demonstrate that simple N&#8208;methoxyamide substrates bearing a tethered heteroatom can be used to access oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;heterocycles of different ring sizes. The catalytic system couples a Cu(I)&#8208;induced radical generation and the subsequent 1,5&#8208;H&#8208;atom transfer together with a Cu(III)&#8208;involved &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;radical trapping by a tethered heteroatom, realizing a redox&#8208;neutral C&#8211;H amination and oxygenation without external oxidants.








Abstract
Cyclative C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization of unactivated C&#9472;H bonds with heteroatoms is a straightforward way to construct saturated aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles, which continues to display ever&#8208;increasing prevalence in drug design. Building upon our recently reported copper catalysis that used simple N&#8208;methoxyamides as radical precursors, we report a method to access diverse aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles, including cyclic sulfonamides, cyclic ethers, and lactones of different ring sizes. By placing a heteroatom in the N&#8208;methoxyamide substrate, the carbon radical formed at the &#947;&#8208;position from the intramolecular H&#8208;abstraction by the amidyl radical could be trapped with the pendant heteroatom, leading to a redox&#8208;neutral Cu&#8208;catalyzed cyclative &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization. The syntheses of a wide range of saturated aza&#8208; and oxo&#8208;heterocycles demonstrate the versatility of this method.

         <dc:description>
This work presents a water&#8208;processable covalent&#8208;and&#8208;supramolecular polymeric binder that unites poly(acrylic acid), eight&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol), and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 host&#8211;guest interactions into a single adaptive network. Through strong adhesion, reversible stress dissipation, and uniform lithium&#8208;ion transport, the binder enables silicon&#8211;carbon anodes with outstanding interfacial stability and long&#8208;term cycling durability.








Abstract
Silicon/carbon (Si/C) composite anodes are among the most promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume fluctuation and interfacial degradation during cycling. Herein, we report a water&#8208;processable covalent&#8208;and&#8208;supramolecular polymeric binders (CSPBs) that synergistically dissipate mechanical stress and promote Li+ transport to stabilize the Si/C anode interface. The CSPBs integrate poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), amine&#8208;terminated eight&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol) (8arm&#8208;PEG&#8208;NH2), and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7/secondary ammonium host&#8211;guest complexes through amidation during electrode fabrication. The covalent linkages impart strong structural integrity, while the reversible supramolecular interactions act as sacrificial bonds to dissipate stress arising from Si volume expansion. Additionally, oxygen&#8208;rich PEG chains form continuous Li+ conduction pathways, enabling efficient ion transport. As a result, the CSPB&#8208;2&#8208;based Si/C anode delivers a high specific capacity of 582.0 mAh g&#8722;1 after 265 cycles at 1C, with superior rate capability than the electrodes based on PAA or solely covalently cross&#8208;linked binders (CCBs). Kinetic analysis reveals an enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient, confirming the improved ionic conductivity of the binder system. This work demonstrates a new strategy for integrating covalent anchoring and dynamic supramolecular adaptability within a sustainable, water&#8208;processable polymeric binder system, paving the way for the design of durable and high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes Enable High&#8208;Resolution Visualization of Plasma Membrane Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright, wash&#8208;free, and serum&#8208;compatible, RSD2 is a rhodamine&#8208;based probe that enables long&#8208;term imaging of plasma membrane substructures, pseudopodia, nanotubes, and migrasomes, with high specificity and minimal cytotoxicity. Its strong fluorogenicity and photoswitching behavior support super&#8208;resolution microscopy, revealing dynamic membrane processes, nanoparticle trafficking, and nanoscale architecture in diverse live and fixed cell types.








Abstract
The plasma membrane exhibits diverse substructures, such as pseudopodia, membrane nanotubes, and migrasomes, that are essential for cellular communication and cargo transport. Imaging these fine structures remains challenging due to their nanoscale dimensions and limitations of existing fluorescent probes. Here, we report the development of two rhodamine&#8208;based probes, RSD1 and RSD2, incorporating anionic membrane&#8208;anchoring groups and pyrrolidine auxochromes to enable wash&#8208;free, serum&#8208;compatible, long&#8208;term plasma membrane imaging. RSD2, in particular, demonstrates superior fluorogenicity, brightness, and photoswitching properties, facilitating high&#8208;resolution imaging in both live and fixed cells. It selectively labels membrane substructures across diverse cell types and maintains membrane specificity in the presence of serum. RSD2 is compatible with advanced microscopy techniques including confocal microscopy, instant structured illumination microscopy (iSIM), and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), achieving up to 40&#160;nm resolution. Using two&#8208;color dSTORM, we visualize silica nanoparticle trafficking via membrane nanotubes and gondola&#8208;like bulges in neuronal cells, marking the first such observation. RSD2 also enables imaging of migrasomes and retraction fibers, revealing dynamic membrane&#8208;mediated transport processes. This probe offers a robust and versatile platform for investigating membrane architecture and function, with broad applicability in cell biology, nanomedicine, and super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Programmed Generation of Coordination, Ionic, and All&#8208;In&#8208;One Cu(I) Chloride Architectures with Highly Efficient Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;programmed synthetic strategy directs ligand protonation and nucleation pathways to produce coordination, ionic, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one Cu(I) chlorides, yielding six new structures with tunable 520&#8211;625 nm emission. Among them, the 1D AIO phase A&#8208;1H[CuCl2] (A = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4AMP) exhibits record photoluminescence quantum yield, outstanding stability, and excellent solution processability, enabling rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free, robust solid&#8208;state lighting and high&#8208;brightness emitting devices.








Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;based hybrid halides feature highly designable structures, systematic tunability, and excellent photoluminescence; however, developing design rules that can predictably modulate their emission across different structural types remains under explored. Here, we report an acid&#8208;programmed generating approach, in which reaction acidity simultaneously modulates ligand protonation and the nucleation barrier, thereby generating coordination, ionic, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one copper(I) chloride architectures by tuning reaction acidity and affording six new compounds with emissions spanning 520&#8211;625&#160;nm. Among these, the AIO compound 3 A&#8208;1H[CuCl2] (A&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4AMP) exhibits a record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 99%, setting a new benchmark for AIO Cu(I)&#8208;based emitters. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveal that the ultrahigh PLQY originates from enhanced lattice rigidity and a triplet phosphorescence pathway. Solubility and thin film fabrication demonstrate excellent processability, while long&#8208;term stability stands in stark contrast to the notorious instability of conventional Cu(I) halides. Moreover, mixing compounds yields broad&#8208;range white&#8208;light emission, underscoring the potential of materials for tunable and high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state lighting. This study establishes acid&#8208;driven structural integration as a general strategy for constructing functional copper(I) halide compounds, laying the foundation for stable, solution&#8208;processable, and high&#8208;performance optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Salt Cluster With Surface Defect Shows Anomalous Acid&#8211;Base Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acid displacement of formic acid in sea&#8208;salt aerosols, releasing HCl, challenges conventional acid&#8211;base chemistry. Our gas&#8208;phase experiments show that this reaction occurs on pure NaCl cluster ions in the absence of water. Surface defects of the NaCl cluster ions enable this reaction via enhanced electrostatic interactions of the salt ions with the formate, outweighing the gas&#8208;phase acidity difference between HCl and formic acid.








Abstract
The acid displacement reaction of formic acid in sea&#8208;salt aerosols to release hydrogen chloride is an enigma in atmospheric chemistry: a weak acid transfers a proton to the conjugate base of a strong acid, reversing solution&#8208;phase acid&#8211;base chemistry. To shed light on this question, we compared the reactivity of formic acid with Na13Cl12+ and Na14Cl13+ under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions in a mass spectrometer. No reaction was observed with Na14Cl13+, a known magic cluster that corresponds to a cubic section of the crystal lattice. Na13Cl12+, which corresponds to the cubic section with a surface defect, reacts readily with release of hydrogen chloride and incorporation of formate into the salt structure. Quantum chemical calculations show that the reaction is substantially endothermic for the magic cluster. The surface defect, however, makes it exothermic. The reason lies in the induced fit of the formate ion in the Na13Cl11(HCOO)+ cluster. Its oxygen atoms interact with five sodium ions. In sum, these electrostatic interactions more than offset the 49 &#177; 13&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 difference in gas&#8208;phase acidity between hydrogen chloride and formic acid.

         <title>Selectively Electrocatalytic Reductive Dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol over Cu Nanowire Arrays at Industrial Current Densities</title>

         <dc:description>
A sustainable and low&#8208;cost electrocatalytic strategy is highlighted for selectively reductive dehydroxylation of 1,4&#8208;butenediol (BED) to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol (BTO) under ambient conditions. Cu nanowire arrays accelerate the dissociation of C&#9472;OH bond in BED and exhibit a high BTO production rate of 190.8 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reductive dehydroxylation is a promising strategy for sustainable synthesis of commodity and high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals but remains a formidable challenge due to the high dissociation energy of C&#9472;OH bond. Here, we report a selectively electrocatalytic reductive dehydroxylation of 1,4&#8208;butenediol (BED) to produce 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol (BTO) over Cu nanowire arrays (Cu NWAs) under ambient conditions. A high BED conversion of &#8764;90.5% and a BTO selectivity of &#8764;80.2% are achieved at &#8211;0.9&#160;V versus RHE. Even in a large&#8208;scale two&#8208;electrode H&#8208;type elecrolyser (1&#160;L), the Cu NWAs stably exhibit a BED conversion of &#8805;&#160;92.3%, a BTO selectivity of &#8805;&#160;82.7%, and a BTO production rate of 190.8 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at an industrial current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu surface facilitates the dissociation of C&#9472;OH bond in BED and the desorption of BTO, which thus promotes the selective dehydroxylation of BED to BTO. This work highlights a sustainable and efficient strategy for producing high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Dual Modification Strategy of Ionic Liquid for Durable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual modification strategy utilizing 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (BM) has been implemented to simultaneously improve the uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and passivate defects in perovskite. The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) attains a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.59%, while the perovskite solar module (PSM) achieves an exceptional efficiency of 22.50% with an aperture area of 12.8&#160;cm2. Notably, these PSCs exhibits outstanding photostability, maintaining unchanged PCE even after 1000&#160;h of continuous solar irradiation.








Abstract
The inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC), featuring self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as the hole transport layer, has achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 27%. However, the non&#8208;uniformity of SAMs and intrinsic defects within the perovskite film continue to constrain further enhancements in device performance. Herein, we developed a strategy for the synchronous modification of SAMs and perovskite by incorporating an ionic liquid of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (BM) to enhance the uniformity of SAMs and passivate defects in perovskite. Specifically, BM was incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to effectively occupy halide vacancies and passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+. Meanwhile, owing to its ionic properties and the interaction between its functional groups and SAM, BM can effectively regulate the colloidal properties and reduce surface roughness, achieving a more uniform SAM layer. By employing this dual modification strategy, BM significantly modulates the crystallization kinetics, thereby facilitating the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films characterized by substantially enlarged grain sizes and a markedly reduced defect density. Consequently, the device incorporating dual modification of BM achieved a champion PCE of 26.59%, demonstrating exceptional operational stability with no observable PCE degradation after continuous power output at maximum power point (MPP) for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Polyphenol Colchicine Nanoparticles Targeting Oxidative Stress and Inflammation for Treatment of Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortality, driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. While colchicine shows potential in reducing cardiovascular events, its therapeutic application remains limited and requires further optimization. This study introduces a coordination&#8208;driven, self&#8208;assembled nanoparticle system combining colchicine, tannic acid, and zinc to enhance therapeutic effects of atherosclerosis.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;inflammatory colchicine therapy has emerged as a new era for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, the therapeutic benefit of colchicine has not been clearly defined. Herein, we present a double coordination&#8208;driven approach to fabricate a stable metal&#8208;organic nano&#8208;assembly of colchicine (COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn) by uniting the tropolone ring of colchicine (COL), phenolic groups of tannic acid (TA), and Zn2+ ions. This design leverages the antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of COL and TA to create a nanoscale platform capable of scavenging radicals and modulating inflammatory pathways. Through robust Zn2+ coordination, the resulting COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn nanocomplexes exhibit enhanced stability under physiological conditions, ensuring efficient delivery and sustained bioactivity. In vitro assays confirm suppression of foam cell formation and multiple inflammatory mediators, suggesting significant potential for managing atherosclerosis by targeting both oxidative stress and inflammation. Intravenous administration of COL&#8208;TA&#8208;Zn in Apoe&#8722;/&#8722; mice significantly reduces atherosclerotic plaque area, MMP&#8208;9, TNF&#8208;&#945;, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby illustrating its superior anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy compared to COL alone. These findings highlight the promise of the dual coordination&#8208;driven nanoplatform in cardiovascular disease treatment.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of the Prototypical n&#8208;Type Polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) Enables Capacity Enhancement and High&#8208;Temperature Stability in Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular engineering of the prototypical n&#8208;type polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) through side&#8208;chain shortening and donor simplification yields P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) with 1.51&#8208;fold increase in capacity (56.9 &#8594; 86.0 mAh g&#8722;1). Both polymers maintain long&#8208;term cycling stability at 60 &#176;C&#8212;where small&#8208;molecule organic electrodes typically fail&#8212;thereby revealing design rules that link backbone structure to electron transport, Li+ diffusion, and thermal durability.








Abstract
Conjugated n&#8208;type polymers have long been explored as organic cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the widely studied P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) has received limited attention as a practical cathode because of its modest capacity (&#8764;55 mAh g&#8722;1). Here, we report the first systematic effort to re&#8208;engineer this prototypical polymer through side&#8208;chain shortening and donor simplification. Replacing bulky 2&#8208;octyldodecyl (2OD) chains with 2&#8208;butyloctyl (2BO) and simplifying the bithiophene (T2) donor to a vinylene (V) produced P(NDI2BO&#8208;V), which delivers a 1.51&#8208;fold higher capacity (56.9&#8594;86.0 mAh g&#8722;1) while retaining excellent cycling stability. Crucially, we show that n&#8208;type polymers can achieve remarkable cycling stability at elevated temperatures: both polymers remained stable at 60 &#176;C, where small molecules fail, with P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) keeping 97% after 1000 cycles and P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) 80% after 600 cycles. Mechanistic studies combining electrochemical analysis with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how donor linker units dictate structure and transport. Crystalline P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) exhibits higher electronic conductivity and undergoes a one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron redox process, whereas amorphous P(NDI2BO&#8208;V) offers enhanced Li+ diffusivity but follows a stepwise pathway. This work establishes a molecular design framework for conjugated polymer cathodes that combine high capacity, efficient charge transport, and long&#8208;term thermal stability, advancing their potential for practical LIB applications.

Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide&#8208;catalyzed long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;induced Group 13, 14, and 15 elementalizations of alkenes and alkynes are achieved through in situ production of tert&#8208;butyl radicals employing blue/green/orange (up to 600&#160;nm) LEDs.

Abstract
We present di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide (DTBP)&#8208;catalyzed long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;induced Group 13, 14, and 15 elementalizations of alkenes and alkynes, through in situ production of tert&#8208;butyl radicals, followed by a hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer process generating silyl, germyl, stannyl, alkyl, boryl, and phosphoryl radicals. This mild and photosensitizer&#8208;free methodology employing blue (450&#160;nm)/green (530&#160;nm)/orange (600&#160;nm) LEDs affords high chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance compared to conventional use of shorter&#8208;wavelength light. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational data are consistent with a vibration&#8208;mediated photolysis mechanism of DTBP involving electronic excitation from vibrationally excited ground states (S0&#956;n) to the excited state (S0&#956;n&#8594;Sn transitions), driven by ultraweak absorption of long&#8208;wavelength visible light.

         <title>Radical Electroprecipitation from a Water|Oil|Electrode Interface Prolongs &#8220;Electro&#8221;Chemiluminescence of the Tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)Ruthenium(II) and Benzoyl Peroxide System by 103</title>

         <dc:description>
Multiphase systems, including ones with liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundaries, are the home to many curious chemistries including reaction acceleration and spontaneous formation of reactive species. Here we show the liquid&#8208;liquid interface causes electrochemiluminescence and afterglow chemiluminescence lifetime to be enhanced by 220,000% in&#8208;time, far beyond when the electrical potential is applied.








Abstract
Reactive intermediates, including radicals and other short&#8208;lived molecules, are ubiquitous in pure chemical processes and often highly difficult to isolate. Recently, we found that energetic, reactive radical species can be trapped through electroprecipitation, where the precipitate contains a reactive intermediate. The principle is straight&#8208;forward: If a solubility equilibrium can be exceeded before the reactive intermediate lifetime, the intermediate can be precipitated. Classically, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a process where electrical energy is transferred to chemical energy, and then the chemical energy is released in the form of light emission (often in the presence of an electroactive luminophore). The apparent luminescence lifetime, limited by radical lifetimes, of ECL reactions in solution is short (sub&#8208;microsecond), and thus can hinder the performance of the technique as light emission is confined to the electrode surface and occurs only when the electrical potential to the system is applied. Here, we show that with a high concentration (10&#8211;250&#160;mM) of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) being co&#8208;reduced with a tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) complex, we can achieve an ECL emission that lasts for hundreds of seconds after potential arrest, corresponding to a thousand&#8208;fold (103) increase in apparent afterglow chemiluminescence lifetimes. This electroprecipitation process occurs at an aqueous|organic multiphase boundary, which are present all through nature and are arguably more representative of natural chemical processes. Furthermore, experimental parameters, including BPO concentration, applied potential, and electrode material, were investigated. Competitive and parasitic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and decarboxylation, diminish the electroprecipitation of reactive intermediates, and we detail mitigation and optimization efforts. Overall, this work reveals that multiphase interfaces can be used to electroprecipitate reactive radicals, separating their use in space and time.

         <title>Growth, Dissolution and Segregation of Genetically Encoded RNA Droplets by Ribozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribozymes enable sequence&#8208;encoded turnover of RNA droplet material, resulting in transiently active droplets that selectively segregate based on their genotype. This establishes a direct link between genetic information and droplet behavior, marking a step toward programmable, evolvable RNA&#8208;based compartments with life&#8208;like properties.








Abstract
Active droplets, membraneless compartments driven by internal chemical reactions, are compelling models for protocells and synthetic life. A central challenge is to program their dynamic behaviors using heritable genetic information, which would grant them the capacity to evolve. Here, we create transiently active RNA droplets by integrating sites for ribozyme catalysis directly into the sequence of self&#8208;assembling, four&#8208;arm RNA nanostars. To enable perfusion and observe the resulting dynamics over time, we develop a method for trapping individual droplets in hydrogel cages by targeted in situ photopolymerization. This enables us to quantify the sequence&#8208;programmable droplet dissolution and to control the degradation kinetics by choosing between fast (hammerhead) and slow (hairpin) ribozymes. Furthermore, we trigger the segregation of mixed droplet populations via the sequence&#8208;specific cleavage of a chimeric linker RNA. The droplet&#8208;encapsulated DNA templates code for the regrowth of new droplets, establishing the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for a minimal, genetically encoded cycle of dissolution and regrowth. By directly linking RNA sequence to droplet stability, composition, and life&#8208;cycle dynamics, our work provides a robust platform for engineering evolvable materials and advancing the bottom&#8208;up construction of synthetic&#160;cells.

         <title>Energy Level Engineering of Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks Through &#960;&#8208;Expansion of Cores Toward Tandem Photocatalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several kinds of 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazine cores were designed and synthesized. These COFs can serve as efficient and recyclable tandem photocatalysts toward two polymerization reactions through energy&#8208;level engineering.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating photoredox&#8208;active motifs show great promise as heterogeneous catalysts, yet their applications have been largely confined to one&#8208;step transformations. In this work, we design and synthesize a series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs with different &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazine cores to achieve superior photocatalytic performance. These 3D COFs exhibit excellent crystallinity, high surface areas, and remarkable chemical stability. More importantly, they can work as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for photocatalytic tandem polymerization reactions using styrene and fluoroalkyl anhydrides as substrates, yielding fluoroalkylated polystyrene polymers with narrow dispersity. These COFs constitute the first examples as tandem photocatalysts toward polymerization reactions. Moreover, optimal energy level alignment and enhanced photophysical properties are identified as key factors contributing to their high efficacy. This work not only provides a viable design strategy for multifunctional COF catalysts, but also expands their utility in complex synthetic sequences involving tandem catalytic processes.

         <title>SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite with Isolated Co2+ Sites as an Efficient and Durable Catalyst System for Non&#8208;Oxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts with the isolated Co2+ species in the 6MR (Co2+&#9472;Z2) and 8MR ([Co(OH)]+&#9472;Z) windows of the SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite were synthesized for non&#8208;oxidative ethane dehydrogenation to ethene. The Co2+&#9472;Z2 species demonstrate an unexpectedly high rate of ethene formation in comparison with the ([Co(OH)]+&#9472;Z species. The most active developed catalyst with Co2+&#9472;Z2 outperforms analogues of commercial K&#8208;CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 in terms of ethene formation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (EDH) is an attractive method for on&#8208;purpose ethene production, but achieving high activity and, especially, durability with catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals remains challenging. Herein, we introduce the Co/SSZ&#8208;13 system with exclusively divalent cobalt (Co2+) ions that meets the above requirements. The use of complementary characterization techniques enabled us to reveal two Co2+ species: Co2+&#9472;Z2 located in the six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring windows and [Co(OH)]+&#9472;Z in the eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring windows, with Z representing a charged zeolite framework site. A quantitative correlation between the rate of ethene formation and the site population establishes Co2+&#9472;Z2 as the active species. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms their structural and electronic stability under high&#8208;temperature reaction conditions. The optimized 0.9Co/SSZ&#8208;13 (0.9Co) catalyst showed highly durable operation over 200 dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles at 600&#8211;650&#176;C lasting for 150 h with industrially relevant productivity. In this regard, it outperforms almost all previously developed catalysts even those with platinum as an active component. The obtained results uncover the atomic&#8208;level origins of EDH activity/durability of the Co/SSZ&#8208;13 system and highlight the critical role of metal site location in designing highly active, selective, and durable catalysts for on&#8208;purpose ethene production.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Biohybrid Upcycling of Polylactic Acid Plastics to Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;photosynthesis hybrid system that integrates enzymatic PLA depolymerization and photocatalytic LA upgrading was constructed, which enables the PLA waste transformed into alanine under ambient conditions with a considerable yield rate of 61.91&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Upcycling of waste plastics into commodity chemicals such as amino acids represents a promising route toward achieving negative carbon emissions and enabling a circular carbon economy. However, existing thermocatalytic methods typically require harsh conditions. While photocatalytic upcycling operates under mild conditions, its dependence on a high&#8208;temperature hydrolysis step for plastic pretreatment undermines its overall practicality. Here we report a bio&#8208;photocatalytic hybrid system that converts polylactic acid (PLA) plastics into alanine under ambient conditions. The integrated system begins with enzymatic depolymerization of PLA to lactic acid (LA) with 92% conversion at 55&#176;C and pH 10, catalyzed by an engineered peptidase derived from the Micromonospora sp. strain. Without any purification, the resulting hydrolysate is fed directly to the photosynthesis system, where the LA monomers are converted to alanine over a Ni/ZnIn2S4 catalyst using ammonia as a nitrogen source. This photocatalytic process, which proceeds via an oxygen&#8208;centered radical intermediate pathway, achieves an alanine production rate of 61.91&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an overall yield of 60%. Life cycle assessment demonstrates that our tandem bio&#8208;photoconversion system substantially reduces the carbon footprint compared to single&#8208;step thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems. This work thus establishes a sustainable route for valued chemicals production from low&#8208;cost feedstocks.

&lt;p&gt;A bio-photosynthesis hybrid system that integrates enzymatic PLA depolymerization and photocatalytic LA upgrading was constructed, which enables the PLA waste transformed into alanine under ambient conditions with a considerable yield rate of 61.91&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcycling of waste plastics into commodity chemicals such as amino acids represents a promising route toward achieving negative carbon emissions and enabling a circular carbon economy. However, existing thermocatalytic methods typically require harsh conditions. While photocatalytic upcycling operates under mild conditions, its dependence on a high-temperature hydrolysis step for plastic pretreatment undermines its overall practicality. Here we report a bio-photocatalytic hybrid system that converts polylactic acid (PLA) plastics into alanine under ambient conditions. The integrated system begins with enzymatic depolymerization of PLA to lactic acid (LA) with 92% conversion at 55&#176;C and pH 10, catalyzed by an engineered peptidase derived from the &lt;i&gt;Micromonospora&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain. Without any purification, the resulting hydrolysate is fed directly to the photosynthesis system, where the LA monomers are converted to alanine over a Ni/ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst using ammonia as a nitrogen source. This photocatalytic process, which proceeds via an oxygen-centered radical intermediate pathway, achieves an alanine production rate of 61.91&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an overall yield of 60%. Life cycle assessment demonstrates that our tandem bio-photoconversion system substantially reduces the carbon footprint compared to single-step thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems. This work thus establishes a sustainable route for valued chemicals production from low-cost feedstocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ga&#8208;Induced Reversal of Pd Electronic States in ZrO2&#8208;Supported Pd2Ga1 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Ethanol Electrooxidation via the C1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga&#8208;induced electronic redistribution reverses the Pd electronic states, endowing the catalyst with outstanding EOR activity and durability as well as high selectivity toward the C1 pathway.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are recognized as a promising energy conversion technology due to their high energy density and the renewable, eco&#8208;friendly nature of ethanol. However, their commercialization is hindered by the lack of anode catalysts that simultaneously offer high activity, stability, and selectivity toward the C1 pathway in the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Herein, we report a rationally designed Pd2Ga1&#8208;ZrO2@NC electrocatalyst, in which Pd2Ga1 alloy nanoparticles are anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated ZrO2 nanoframework. In alkaline media, this catalyst exhibits exceptional EOR performance, achieving a remarkable mass activity of 27.3 A mgPd&#8722;1, 3.6 and 21.8 times higher than those of Pd&#8208;ZrO2@NC and commercial Pd/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates a high C1 pathway selectivity of 58.7% at 0.8 VRHE&#160;and retains 48.9% of its initial activity after 2000 accelerated durability test cycles, significantly outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal the crucial function of Ga as an electron donor, which reverses the electron transfer around Pd from outward (in Pd&#8208;ZrO2@NC) to inward (in Pd2Ga1&#8208;ZrO2@NC), creating an electron&#8208;rich Pd state. This electronic restructuring thereby lowers the *CO oxidation barrier, strengthens *OH adsorption, and enhances metal&#8208;support interaction, collectively boosting both the C1 pathway selectivity and the overall EOR performance. This work provides valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance alloy&#8208;oxide composite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Engineering Guides the Design of &#946;&#8208;Sheet Inhibitor to Anchor Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino acid side&#8208;chain engineering strategy, proposed based on the amino acid pairing in natural proteins, can modulate the complementarity of noncovalent interactions between side chains in engineered &#946;&#8208;sheets. This enables the construction of stable &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors for effective targeting of PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Customizing inhibitors for &#946;&#8208;sheet mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) remains a challenge in medicinal chemistry research. Directly separating &#946;&#8208;sheet elements from the PPI interface as inhibitors represents a feasible strategy. Although useful, peptides derived from PPIs typically lose their natural secondary structure, resulting in low affinity. How to construct stable &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors remains elusive, mainly due to the lack of reliable strategies to guide the design of &#946;&#8208;sheet backbones. In this study, we propose an amino acid side&#8208;chain engineering strategy (AASE) to design of &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors. Specifically, this strategy was based on the amino acid pairing (AAP) principle observed in the &#946;&#8208;sheets of natural proteins, and further integrates the complementarity of various non&#8208;covalent interactions between &#946;&#8208;strand side chains. When combined with high&#8208;throughput peptide screening technology, above strategy can generate structurally defined &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitors. We validated the physicochemical properties of the &#946;&#8208;sheet structures obtained under the aforementioned strategy and prioritized the peptide EH. The &#946;&#8208;sheet inhibitor formed by EH exhibits potent biological functions, enabling high&#8208;resolution imaging of tumors in the NIR window and guiding tumor resection. In addition, EH can inhibit tumor growth as a PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. This strategy provides valuable guidance for the design of PPI inhibitors with &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Electricity and Light for Efficient Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Recycling of Polystyrene Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic interplay of electricity, light and earth&#8208;abundant, nontoxic iron catalysis allowed for the efficient recycling of post&#8208;consumer polymers into value&#8208;added products. This robust depolymerization strategy was viable on multigram&#8208;scale, where the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction presents an attractive opportunity for a green hydrogen production.








Abstract
Due to their intensive use in every aspect of our everyday life, plastics are accumulating in the environment, hence representing a major societal challenge. The accumulation of plastic waste in the oceans is expected to reach 40 billion tons by 2050. Thus, efficient methods for chemical plastic waste recycling continue to be in high demand toward a future circular economy. Herein, we report a powerful and user&#8208;friendly strategy merging inexpensive and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysis, light irradiation and electricity to recycle polystyrene and styrene&#8208;containing copolymers into value&#8208;added benzoyl products with up to 73% yield. The robustness of this approach using iron&#8208;electrocatalysis under light irradiation was further demonstrated using postconsumer waste, also viable on multigram scale. Cathodic formation of molecular hydrogen through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy through a societally useful anodic oxidative transformation.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Solid Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Co3O4 Catalysts Towards Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation Reaction of Alkynols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co3O4 nanorod (Co3O4&#8211;NR) catalyst with abundant solid&#8208;frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) exhibits exceptional performance towards semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynols, which is superior to non&#8208;precious metal catalysts and even comparable to noble metal ones.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynols to enols represents a vital industrial reaction for fine chemical synthesis, yet developing highly selective non&#8208;noble metal catalysts remains an urgent challenge. Herein, we report a Co3O4 nanorod (Co3O4&#8208;NR) catalyst with abundant solid&#8208;frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) on specifically exposed {110} facets, where coordinatively unsaturated Co2+ acts as Lewis acid site whilst the surface hydroxyl group serves as Lewis base site. The Co3O4&#8208;NR catalyst exhibits exceptional performance toward semi&#8208;hydrogenation from 3&#8208;butyn&#8208;1&#8208;ol to 3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol with a product yield of 88.2%, which is preponderate to other non&#8208;noble metal catalysts. Poisoning experiments, in situ DRIFTS and theoretical calculations verify that the SFLPs sites serve as intrinsic active centers for H2 activation/dissociation and substrate adsorption. The hydrogenation of key intermediate (C4H7O*) is identified as the rate&#8208;determining step, where H&#948;+ species strongly tethered to surface&#160;&#8722;OH group suppresses over&#8208;hydrogenation and thereby enhances the semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity. Projected density of states (PDOS) analysis reveals an accelerated hydrogenation kinetics via d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between Co 3d orbitals and C 2p orbitals in C4H7O*. This work advances the design of efficient and cost&#8208;effective SFLPs&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts, which shows potential application in the synthesis of fine chemicals.

In the Research Article (e202519101), Tengfei Yan, Ofer Reany, Junqiu Liu, and co&#8208;workers present a reversible, light&#8208;controlled ON/OFF chloride channel based on azobenzene&#8208;functionalized semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils. These biomimetic systems achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive chloride transport through photoisomerization, demonstrating unprecedented controllability in both liposomal membranes and living cells. The (E)&#8208;isomer selectively enables chloride flux, induces significant mitochondrial and lysosomal disruption, and promotes apoptosis in cancer cells, while the (Z)&#8208;isomer remains inactive.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Polysulfates via S(VI)&#8208;Fluoride Exchange Iterative Exponential Growth (SuFEx IEG)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SuFEx iterative exponential growth enables the synthesis of uniform polysulfates, block copolymers (BCPs), and cyclic polymers through orthogonal activation of SuFEx&#8208;inactive groups. This modular platform also produces sequence&#8208;defined polysulfates that encode 16&#8208;bit information as an aperiodic arrangement of two building blocks, demonstrating programmable molecular design.








Abstract
Leveraging the high reactivity, modularity, and orthogonality of the S(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction, a new addition to click chemistry, we report here the SuFEx iterative exponential growth (SuFEx IEG) method for synthesizing uniform polymers and block copolymers (BCPs) with molecular weights up to 21&#160;kDa. The key step in SuFEx IEG was the on&#8208;demand, orthogonal activation of the pair of functional groups, the SuFEx&#8208;inactive tetrahydropyranyl and imidazylate groups, into SuFEx&#8208;active tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) and sulfonyl fluoride. With SuFEx IEG, we demonstrate the synthetic encoding of 16&#8208;bit information into the sequence&#8208;defined polysulfate of diphenyl sulfide and diphenyl ether. The modular nature of the SuFEx click reaction enabled the synthesis of uniform polysulfates, including hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polysulfates, that served as modules to create block copolymers (BCPs) and triblock copolymers without molecular weight distribution. The chain ends of the polymers and BCPs produced via SuFEx IEG were used to prepare uniform cyclic polymers and BCPs via intramolecular SuFEx cyclization. The SuFEx IEG method provides a robust and versatile approach for precisely constructing uniform linear and cyclic polymers, as well as sequence&#8208;defined polymers, across a broad molecular weight range.

         <title>Multidirectional Charge Separation in Self&#8208;Assembled Aggregates of Perylenebisimide&#8208;Porphyrin Bola&#8208;Supra&#8208;Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable aggregates of a new hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) bola&#8208;type supra&#8208;amphiphile have been synthesized by lyophilization of solutions of both single molecules in THF/water mixtures, followed by redispersion in pure water. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy verifies the spherical morphology. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy unravels multi&#8208;directional charge separation from the porphyrin to the PBI and within the PBI stacks. 








Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated bola&#8208;type supra&#8208;amphiphile and assembly thereof in water. The assembly is based on amphiphilic porphyrins and hydrophobic perylenebisimdes (PBI), which both form the resulting bola&#8208;form solely through the H&#8208;bonding motif, which is shielded by the assembly of the chromophores itself. The amphiphilic porphyrin was functionalized, on one hand, with a cyanuric acid and, on the other hand, with an oligo carboxylate dendron as polar head group. Two Hamilton receptors were linked to the PBI on each imide position. Assembly was achieved by lyophilizing solutions of both components in water/THF mixtures, followed by redispersion in pure water yielding stable suspensions. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) reveal a spherical morphology with diameters ranging from 15 &#8211; 100&#160;nm. Once formed, the assemblies showed broadened absorptions and quenched PBI&#8208;centered fluorescence. Using time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy, the nature of the fluorescence quenching was confirmed to be either charge separation, by which the porphyrin donates an electron to the PBI, or symmetry breaking charge separation, by which &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked PBIs donate and accept electrons. Denaturation of the supra&#8208;amphiphile went hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with a reinstation of the PBI fluorescence and suppression of charge separation.

         <title>Tailored Hierarchical Bonding Networks Derive Ultra&#8208;Stable Underwater Adhesion in Harsh Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane network enriched with dense interaction sites (hydroxyls, aromatic rings, cations, and hydrophobic groups), the adhesive delivers multiscale synergistic enhancement of both cohesion and interfacial adhesion. It demonstrates robust bonding strength (12.2&#160;MPa in dry conditions and 3.4&#160;MPa underwater), long&#8208;term stability across diverse extreme environments, and strong antibacterial/antifungal activity.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance water&#8208;resistant and underwater adhesives is critical for advancing underwater technologies, yet achieving robust functional adhesion with long&#8208;term durability in complex underwater environments remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a hierarchical bonding network strategy to realize stable adhesion under harsh underwater conditions. By engineering a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane backbone embedded with dense active interaction sites, including hydroxyl groups, benzene rings, cations, and hydrophobic moieties, we create synergistic multiscale interactions that amplify both cohesion and interfacial adhesion.&#160;The optimized adhesive achieves a strong bonding strength of 12.2&#160;MPa and an underwater adhesion of 3.4&#160;MPa on steel substrates and retains stability in corrosive underwater environments (acidic, alkaline, and saline solutions) over extended periods. It further demonstrates exceptional thermal resilience, maintaining functionality across temperatures from &#8208;196 to 150&#160;&#176;C.&#160;Integrating quaternary ammonium cations with long&#8208;chain alkanes endows the material with potent antibacterial activity (&#8805;99.9999% inhibition) and the highest antifungal grade. This work provides a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance multifunctional adhesives with strong adhesion, long&#8208;term durability, extreme temperature resistance, and antimicrobial properties, offering broad potential for applications in demanding underwater environments.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Enabled Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Site&#8208;Selective Cycloaddition of Unprotected Oximes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intermolecular cyclization of unprotected oximes with alkenes was achieved by dual photo&#8208; and copper catalysis. This protocol avoids oxygen&#8208;activating reagents and suppresses side reactions of free oximes, enabling streamlined synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrroline scaffolds with water as the by&#8208;product. Key to the method is energy&#8208;transfer photosensitization of a copper&#8208;oxime complex, inducing net oxidative addition of the N&#9472;OH bond to copper.








Abstract
While methodologies for N&#9472;O bond scission in O&#8208;functionalized oximes are well established, the analogous activation of free oximes remains challenging, largely due to the formidable hurdles associated with selective N&#9472;O bond cleavage and competing side reactions involving the acidic O&#9472;H moiety. Herein, we report a dual photo&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed strategy that directly promotes homolytic cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond in free oximes through photosensitization of oxime&#8208;ligated copper complexes, thereby overcoming prior limitations. Mechanistic studies, including full characterization of key copper intermediates, support an energy transfer (EnT) pathway. This distinctive activation mode enables a previously elusive intermolecular cyclization between unprotected oximes and alkenes, delivering valuable 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high efficiency.

         <title>Realizing Phase&#8208;Matching of Nonlinear Optical [ABa3Br2][Ga5Se10] (A&#160;=&#160;Cs, Rb, K, Na) Through Large Anisotropic Lattice Distortion</title>

         <dc:description>
The increase in birefringence stems from the large anisotropic lattice distortion and directly promotes phase matching ability in nonlinear optical crystals [ABa3Br2][Ga5Se10] (A&#160;=&#160;Cs, Rb, K, Na). 








Abstract
Achieving phase&#8208;matching (PM) behavior by enhancing the birefringence of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals has been a formidable challenge. Herein, salt&#8208;inclusion chalcogenides [ABa3Br2][Ga5Se10] (A&#160;=&#160;Cs, 1; Rb, 2; K, 3; Na, 4) that crystal in tetragonal system were synthesized and exhibit smaller c/a ratios (where a and c are the lattice constants) when compared with their Cl&#8208;analogues, indicative of an anisotropic lattice distortion. Along the a&#8208; and c&#8208;axes, the refractive indices show a significant divergence, corresponding to the decrease or increase in electron density. Such anisotropic behavior significantly enhances the birefringence of compounds 1&#8211;4 (0.044&#8211;0.066 @546&#160;nm), realizing the transition from non&#8208;PM (Cl&#8208;analogues) to PM (compounds 1&#8211;4) characteristics at near 2.0&#160;um laser. Moreover, compounds 1&#8211;4 represent a rare class of selenides that combine significant PM second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (&gt;1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2) with wide optical band gaps (&gt;3.0&#160;eV). This work achieves the critical transition from non&#8208;PM to PM behavior through significant anisotropic lattice distortion, thereby offering a new avenue for developing NLO materials.

         <title>Epitaxial Active Interface to Construct Intralattice&#8208;Bonded Asymmetric Bi1&#9472;O&#9472;Bi2 Sites for Robust CO2 Photoreduction to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice bonded asymmetric Bi1&#8208;O&#8208;Bi2 active site is constructed through the epitaxial growth. This configuration facilitates directed charge transfer and favors the crucial C&#9472;C coupling step to form the OCCO* intermediate, leading to selective production of acetic acid.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective synthesis of C2 chemicals from CO2 is a crucial pathway for carbon cycling, but it is limited by the high kinetic barrier of C&#9472;C coupling. This study proposes an epitaxial growth strategy for lattice&#8208;bonded asymmetric sites. By constructing a Bi1&#9472;O&#9472;Bi2 site at the Bi3NbO7 nano&#8208;dots/Bi3O4Br nanosheet (BNO/BOB) interface to promote C&#9472;C coupling for acetic acid production, the photocatalytic conversion rate of CO2 to acetic acid can reach 192.3 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, with 91.4% selectivity. The apparent quantum efficiency at 380 and 400&#160;nm reach 9.49% and 6.57%, respectively. The key mechanism originates from a cascade electron effect triggered by the interfacial Bi1&#9472;O&#9472;Bi2 sites: the interfacial charge redistribution induces a strong built&#8208;in electric field, where high&#8208;energy electrons selectively occupy the 2&#960; antibonding orbitals of CO* intermediates, significantly weakening the C&#9472;O bond in CO* intermediate. Furthermore, the asymmetric charge redistribution effectively neutralizes the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent CO* intermediates, synergistically stabilizing the OCCO* transition state through d&#8208;&#960; electron feedback from Bi sites. The dual effects synergistically lower the energy barriers for both the C&#9472;C coupling and hydrogenation steps, ultimately steering the reaction pathway towards long&#8208;lasting acetic acid formation.

A four&#8208;component synthesis of azetidines with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center via strain&#8208;release 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;carbofunctionalization of 1&#8208;azabicyclobutanes (ABB) is described. Each reaction component can be modified to permit a high&#8208;throughput&#8208;like library preparation, producing azetidines with various appendages, including biorelevant molecules. The post&#8208;modification of selected products could also generate skeletally distinct azetidines.








Abstract
Despite the high demands for azetidines as privileged motifs in medicinal chemistry, efficient synthesis platforms that enable the rapid preparation of diversely decorated azetidines remain limited. Although the bis&#8208;functionalization of highly strained 1&#8208;azabicyclobutane (ABB) has been one of the most viable, modular, and versatile methods for the synthesis of structurally diverse azetidines, the catalytic installation of aliphatic pendants to ABB remains underexplored. In this work, we report the multicomponent synthesis of the elusive all&#8208;carbon quaternary azetidines from ABBs through the radical addition of azetidines to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, ketones, a 1,3&#8208;enyne, and a vinylphosphonate ester. The reaction is facilitated by a bromide/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed polar&#8208;radical relay strategy, enabling the radical difunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via sequential ring&#8208;strain&#8208;release azetidinylation and Suzuki&#8208;type arylation or alkenylation. Variation in the individual components enabled the synthesis of &gt;60 azetidine derivatives, including modifications of selected biorelevant molecules. The functional group interconversion of representative azetidine derivatives illustrates the method's potential to produce unprecedented spirocyclic azetidine hybrids, which may be useful for exploring uncharted areas of chemical space in drug design. Additionally, a diastereoselective synthesis using Evans&#8217; oxazolidinone enabled the preparation of an enantiopure azetidine, potentially useful as a platform for library preparation of stereochemically diverse azetidines.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Un&#8208;Activated C(sp3)&#9472;H Bond</title>

         <dc:description>
Ni: a new solution for asymmetric C(sp3)&#9472;H activation. The stereoselective synthesis of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centres is achieved via enantioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H arylation using a Ni&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived catalyst. Rational catalytic cycle design uncovers a new reaction pathway that can efficiently induce chiral information during the stereoselective and rate&#8208;determining metalation event.








Abstract
We report the first example of an intermolecular, enantioselective Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#9472;H arylation, providing direct access to challenging all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic centers. Key to this success is the use of a specially designed BINOL&#8208;derived ligand, which enables efficient desymmetrization of gem&#8208;dimethyl groups through a rate&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining C&#9472;H activation step. This catalytic system demonstrates remarkable functional group tolerance, affording a wide variety of arylated products in high yields (up to 85%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95:5 e.r.). Mechanistic studies, combining kinetic isotope effect measurements, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, reveal that the Ni&#8211;BINOL complex promotes a unique concerted metalation&#8211;deprotonation pathway assisted by ligand coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This work establishes nickel as a powerful and sustainable alternative to precious metals for asymmetric C&#9472;H activation, opening new perspectives for the construction of enantioenriched quaternary carbon centers of high relevance in drug discovery and materials science.

         <title>Conjugation Engineering Boosts Alkynyl&#8208;Copper Photocatalysis for Efficient Selective Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel alkynyl copper photocatalysts exhibiting broad light absorption, high charge carrier separation efficiency, and excellent stability were designed and synthesized through a conjugation engineering strategy in phenylacetylide&#8208;copper (PACu). These photocatalysts demonstrated outstanding conversion rates and selectivity during the electron&#8208;mediated oxygen activation process. 








Abstract
Phenylacetylide&#8208;copper (PACu), as an important photoactive intermediate in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, suffers from limited visible&#8208;light absorption, rapid radiative recombination, and poor photostability, hindering its practical application. Herein, we report a conjugation engineering strategy to address these challenges by replacing phenylacetylene with extended &#960;&#8208;system ligands, such as 2&#8208;ethynylnaphthalene (NA), 9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene (FA), and 1&#8208;ethynylpyrene (BA), yielding a series of new alkynyl&#8208;copper photocatalysts (NACu, FACu, BACu). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation narrows the band gap to 1.95&#160;eV (BACu), extends absorption beyond 600&#160;nm, promotes charge separation, and suppresses CuI oxidation during photocatalysis. The optimized BACu demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic activity and stability in [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition, Glaser coupling, and benzylamine oxidation, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion and selectivity with excellent recyclability. This work provides fundamental insights into electronic structure modulation via conjugation engineering, offering a universal strategy for designing efficient and stable metal&#8208;alkynyl photocatalysts.

         <title>A Doughnut&#8208;Like Eu30 Catalyst for CO2 Photoreduction with Turnover Numbers Over Ten Million</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 30&#8208;europium doughnut&#8208;like cluster Eu30 constructed via a stepwise annular growth assembly mechanism serves as a high&#8208;performance catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with 1.72&#160;&#215;&#160;107 turnover numbers based on the cluster concentration. Experimental and computational results indicate that the excellent performance of Eu30, as the first example of pure lanthanide cluster catalyst, can be attributed to its high redox activity with appropriate energy levels.








Abstract
Polynuclear metal clusters can be potentially high&#8208;performance catalysts for the CO2 reduction owing to the unique spatial structures among multiple active centers. Herein, two 30&#8208;nuclear doughnut&#8208;like lanthanide clusters (Eu30 and Dy30) were synthesized via in situ tandem reaction following a stepwise annular growth mechanism. In contrast to the Dy&#8208;based analog, Eu30 serves as a high&#8208;performance catalyst in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with 98% selectivity and a record&#8208;high turnover number reaching 1.720&#160;&#215;&#160;107, a rare case with only lanthanide metals as the active centers. Experimental and computational results indicate that the excellent performance of Eu30, as the first example of pure lanthanide cluster catalyst, can be attributed to its high redox activity with an appropriate LUMO energy level.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Reconstruction of Cu&#8211;ZnZrOx Catalyst Enables Synergistic CO2/CO Co&#8208;Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that adding CO to CO2&#8211;H2 feeds induces the restructuring of the Cu&#8211;ZnZrOx catalyst, generating abundant CuZn&#8211;ZnOx interfacial sites. These interfaces drive a synergistic, spatially separated dual&#8208;pathway mechanism, enabling highly efficient methanol synthesis from CO&#8211;CO2 feeds and enhancing activity by up to 2.2&#8208;fold compared to CO&#8208;free feed.








Abstract
Catalytically active phase depends strongly on reaction conditions. In CO2 hydrogenation, efforts have largely emphasized CO2 activation while overlooking how to design active phase for the co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and the kinetically distinct byproduct CO. Here, it is found that adding CO to CO2&#8211;H2 feeds boosts methanol productivity by up to 2.2&#8208;fold via a pronounced synergistic promotion of both CO2 and CO hydrogenation over a Cu&#8211;ZnZrOx catalyst. In situ spectroscopy reveals that CO accelerates Zn reduction and migration onto Cu, increasing Zn0/Cu ratio, Zn2+/Cu, and Cu+/Cu fraction, while reducing exposed surface Cu from 42% to 19%. This CO&#8208;induced restructuring enriches Zn exposure, drives CuZn alloy formation, and creates abundant CuZn alloy&#8211;ZnOx interfaces that stabilize Cu+ sites. These interfaces enable a cooperative dual&#8208;pathway mechanism: CO2 is hydrogenated mainly via the formate route at alloy&#8211;ZnOx sites, whereas CO follows the formyl route on Cu sites. Additionally, in situ&#8208;formed water accelerates conversion of the rate&#8208;determining CH3O* intermediate in the CO pathway. Together, CO&#8208;driven evolution of active sites, synergistic dual&#8208;pathway catalysis, and water&#8208;assisted promotion yield highly efficient methanol synthesis from mixed CO&#8211;CO2 feeds.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of H&#183; to H&#8722;&amp;H+ Enabled by Chemical Looping for Hydrogenation&#8208;Dehydrogenation Tandem Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provided a dynamic modulation strategy for hydrogen species in hydrogenation&#8208;dehydrogenation coupling reaction systems. By constructing an &#8220;electron allocator&#8221; through metal vacancy&#8208;induced electron delocalization, the allocator facilitates electron donation and acquisition via a chemical looping process, achieving the conversion of homolytically dissociated H&#183; into highly active H&#8722;&amp;H+ species and ultimately achieving synergistic enhancement of both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes.








Abstract
Coupling hydrogenation and dehydrogenation is of great significance, as both are pivotal bond reconstruction modes and co&#8208;occur in about 10% of chemical syntheses. However, stoichiometric imbalance often necessitates exogenous hydrogen, which causes &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; and inhibits dehydrogenation, challenging thermodynamics and kinetics of tandem process. Herein, we propose a dynamic strategy based on chemical looping to modulate hydrogen species. We designed Run@NiCu&#8208;VM catalyst with metal vacancy (VM) induced &#8220;electron allocator&#8221; properties, enabling reversible electron capture and release via chemical looping, which drives the neutral H&#183; to convert into H&#8722;&amp;H+, while simultaneously completing electron cycling. The converted H&#8722;&amp;H+ promote hydrogenation of polar &#9472;C&#9552;N bonds in the tandem reaction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandimethanamine, while neutral H&#183; enhances the dehydrogenation rate by avoiding charge repulsion with H&#8722;&amp;H+ generated from dehydrogenation of &#9472;CH2OH. The coupled hydrogenation&#8208;dehydrogenation process achieves a 1.7&#8208;fold rate enhancement, delivers 92% 2,5&#8208;furandimethanamine yield, outperforms most reported catalysts, and exhibits broad substrate applicability.

     alt="Dynamic Modulation of H&#183; to H&#8722;&amp;amp;H+ Enabled by Chemical Looping for Hydrogenation-Dehydrogenation Tandem Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provided a dynamic modulation strategy for hydrogen species in hydrogenation-dehydrogenation coupling reaction systems. By constructing an &#8220;electron allocator&#8221; through metal vacancy-induced electron delocalization, the allocator facilitates electron donation and acquisition via a chemical looping process, achieving the conversion of homolytically dissociated H&#183; into highly active H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;amp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species and ultimately achieving synergistic enhancement of both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupling hydrogenation and dehydrogenation is of great significance, as both are pivotal bond reconstruction modes and co-occur in about 10% of chemical syntheses. However, stoichiometric imbalance often necessitates exogenous hydrogen, which causes &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; and inhibits dehydrogenation, challenging thermodynamics and kinetics of tandem process. Herein, we propose a dynamic strategy based on chemical looping to modulate hydrogen species. We designed Ru&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;@NiCu-V&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with metal vacancy (V&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) induced &#8220;electron allocator&#8221; properties, enabling reversible electron capture and release via chemical looping, which drives the neutral H&#183; to convert into H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;amp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, while simultaneously completing electron cycling. The converted H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;amp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; promote hydrogenation of polar &#9472;C&#9552;N bonds in the tandem reaction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-furandimethanamine, while neutral H&#183; enhances the dehydrogenation rate by avoiding charge repulsion with H&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;amp;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated from dehydrogenation of &#9472;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. The coupled hydrogenation-dehydrogenation process achieves a 1.7-fold rate enhancement, delivers 92% 2,5-furandimethanamine yield, outperforms most reported catalysts, and exhibits broad substrate applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Preparation of Homogenous Antibody Conjugates via Glycosite&#8208;Specific Transglycosylation Enabled by Readily Available Glycosyl Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A streamlined platform for glycosite&#8208;specific antibody conjugation is enabled by LacNAc&#8208;derived cyclic acetal donors, which can be prepared in only two steps and used directly in single&#8208;enzyme Endo S2&#8208;mediated transglycosylation. The platform supports the broad construction of homogeneous gsADCs and gsDACs, with donor 7 producing glycoengineered antibodies that exhibit markedly enhanced stability toward Endo S2&#8208;mediated hydrolysis. 








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific antibody conjugation through glycoengineering offers a promising route to generate homogeneous glycosite&#8208;specific antibody&#8210;drug conjugates (gsADCs) with improved therapeutic indices. Dozens of gsADCs are advancing from preclinical studies to clinical trials. However, current methods involve either multiple enzymes or lengthy preparation of substrates. Herein, we report a novel and synthetically streamlined platform utilizing LacNAc&#8208;derived 4,6&#8208;acetal glycosyl donors for glycosite&#8208;specific transglycosylation mediated by a single enzyme. These glycosyl donors can be synthesized in as few as two steps, representing a major advancement in synthetic accessibility compared to previously reported glycosyl donors, which often require more than 15 steps. Computational analysis showed that the acetal ring restricts conformation, directing donor 7 to a &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stabilized groove of the enzyme. Donor 7, along with a positive control, was evaluated in the context of gsADCs, consistently demonstrating potent and selective cytotoxicity toward HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells, while sparing HER2&#8208;negative cells. Furthermore, donor 7 was successfully adapted to generate glycosite&#8208;specific degrader&#8208;antibody conjugates (gsDACs), highlighting its broad utility. Additional studies revealed that donor 7 produces antibodies with markedly enhanced resistance to Endo S2 mediated hydrolysis. Together, these findings establish a practical and broadly applicable platform for glycosite&#8208;specific antibody conjugation, paving the way for next&#8208;generation antibody&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Dynamic Semiconductor Interface for Scalable Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Chlorine Disinfectants from Natural Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co dynamic equilibrium in CoWOx enables ultrastable active chlorine synthesis of BiVO4 photoanode from seawater. The CoWOx/BiVO4 photoanode achieves exceptional Faradaic efficiency and selectivity over a broad potential range.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical seawater electrolysis for the chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) suffers from low selectivity against competing reactions and high onset potentials, which severely limits its efficiency for disinfectant production and marine&#8208;based chemical synthesis. Herein, we engineer an amorphous CoWOx layer on BiVO4 photoanodes that enables highly selective active chlorine (AC) production directly from natural seawater. The CoWOx/BiVO4 photoanode delivers a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.78&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.2&#160;VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination, with a record&#8208;low onset potential of 0.38&#160;VRHE. Notably, it maintains&#160;&gt;&#160;95% Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for AC production across a wide potential range of 0.9&#8211;1.8&#160;VRHE, and retains 86.9% selectivity at 0.6&#160;VRHE, overcoming the challenge of achieving efficient ClOR at low potentials. The incorporation of W suppresses the dissolution of Bi and V, while a dynamic Co2+/Co3+ equilibrium ensures operational stability over 150&#160;h. In situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that CoWOx accelerates Cl&#8722; oxidation to &#8226;Cl intermediates and steers the reaction pathways toward selective AC formation by thermodynamically favoring key chlorine adsorption configurations. Scaled&#8208;up 25&#160;cm2 photoanodes achieves an AC production rate of 838&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1. The resulting disinfectant exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum bactericidal efficacy, including 99.99% inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus within 24&#160;h. This work establishes a scalable photoelectrode design for the direct, energy&#8208;efficient&#160;and selective production of valuable active chlorine from seawater.

Abstract
Fluorinated four&#8208;membered rings represent valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals; however, the asymmetric synthesis of such fluorinated frameworks bearing chiral quaternary carbon centers has not yet been achieved.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first successful nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of sterically congested all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, achieving broad substrate scope (37 examples) with high efficiency (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee, and TON up to 500). Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that van der Waals interactions play a pivotal role in governing enantioselectivity. This strategy further enables concise asymmetric syntheses of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including Valerate and Esfenvalerate.








Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes has long posed a significant challenge due to their pronounced steric hindrance. Conventional approaches typically rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. The developed catalytic system exhibits a broad substrate scope, delivering excellent reactivity and enantioselectivity across 37 examples (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee, and TON up to 500). Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that van der Waals interactions play a pivotal role in governing enantioselectivity. This strategy further enables concise asymmetric syntheses of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, including Valerate and Esfenvalerate.

         <title>Accelerated O&#9472;O Bond Cleavage and Stabilized Fe Sites by Synergistic d&#9472;p Fe&#9472;Sn Dual&#8208;Atom Pair for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we constructed dual&#8208;atom pair sites consisting of d&#8208;block iron (Fe) and p&#8208;block tin (Sn) anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSnNC), achieving remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that Sn not only accelerates direct O&#9472;O bond cleavage via a dissociative pathway but also redirects the*OH desorption and stabilizes Fe centers.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed FeNC materials have emerged as the promising catalysts for replacing precious Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, their widespread application remains limited by sluggish kinetics and the long&#8208;term stability of the isolated Fe single&#8208;atom sites. Herein, we report a highly active and durable catalyst (FeSnNC) featuring d&#8208;block iron and p&#8208;block&#8208;metal tin dual&#8208;atom pair sites. In situ infrared spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, together with ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#9472;Sn dual&#8208;atom pair sites enable the bridge absorption of O2 and facilitate direct O&#9472;O bond cleavage. The redirection of *OH desorption to the Sn site alleviates Fe&#8208;site degradation, while Sn incorporation can also reinforce the Fe&#9472;N bond, jointly enhancing ORR activity and durability. Under alkaline conditions, the catalyst delivers a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V and a kinetic current density of 69&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.85&#160;V, with negligible performance loss after 10,000 cycles. When applied in a zinc&#8211;air battery, FeSnNC exhibits a peak power density of 262&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a cycling lifetime exceeding 1,100 hours at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the great potential of d&#8211;p metal atomic pair sites in ORR catalysis and provides new insights into the rational design of atomically precise metal catalysts.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Triggered Structural Transformations in 4&#8208;Hydroxypyridinium Halides for Solar&#8208;Blind UV Functional Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of twelve 4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium halides was synthesized to identify high&#8208;performance candidates for advanced solar&#8208;blind UV optics. Centrosymmetric to non&#8208;centrosymmetric structural transformations in this family are achieved by tuning solution acidity. Compound II exhibits the highest birefringence, while XI shows strong nonlinear optical properties.








Abstract
Birefringent and nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are crucial for advanced optical applications, yet achieving large birefringence (&#916;n), noncentrosymmetric (NCS) structures, and broad transparency from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SUV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions remains challenging. Here, we report a 4HPX family of twelve 4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium halides, constructed from 4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium cations [4HPH]+ and halide anions [X]&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;F (I, II), Cl (III, VII, X), Br (IV, VIII, XI), I (V, VI, IX, XII)). Solution acidity dictates the structural transformations of this family, from centrosymmetric (I&#8211;IX) to NCS (X&#8211;XII) phases, where C&#9472;O bond lengths act as definitive structural fingerprints. Their optical bandgaps exceed those of all known halogen polyanion&#8208;based crystals due to the large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps of both [4HPH]+ and [X]&#8722; and can be systematically tuned via hydrogen&#8208;bond strength. The large hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy of [4HPH]+ endow this family with exceptional &#916;n and suitable second&#8211;harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Notably, II [C5H6NO]+(HF2)&#8722; exhibits the largest &#916;n (0.293) within the 4HPX family and among reported water&#8211;free SUV crystals. Meanwhile, I&#8211;V (0.222&#8211;0.293) also outperform commercial birefringent materials. NLO crystals X&#8211;XII show SHG responses. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design of next&#8208;generation birefringent and NLO crystals.

         <title>Photosynthesis of Urea by Cooperative Radicals Addition Using a Peptide as a Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cooperative radical addition pathway for efficient urea synthesis catalyzed by a bio&#8208;inspired proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) photocatalyst via a tandem PCET process.








Abstract
Innovative strategies for efficient photocatalytic urea production are desirable due to the wide applications of urea and derivatives in agriculture and pharmaceuticals, which remain highly challenging. Here, we introduce a simple but efficient radical addition approach to address this challenge by fully utilizing the in situ, synchronously generated aminyl radical (&#183;NH2) and hydroperoxyl radical (HO2&#183;) via the coupling of photocatalytic NH3 oxidation and O2 reduction. The two radicals reassembled and cooperatively reacted with NH2COOH to form urea with markedly lower kinetic barrier than the industrial process. This approach not only achieved record&#8208;high urea production and conversion rates (42.6&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 70%, respectively) but also enabled the direct, single&#8208;step synthesis of unsymmetrical urea derivatives with good yields.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Sonoafterglow Probes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sonoafterglow luminophore with a nonconjugated linker is found to emit a stronger sonoafterglow compared to its counterpart with a conjugated linker due to its inhibited rapid electron transfer; this luminophore is further developed into an activatable probe that selectively targets the cancer biomarker, enabling sensitive tumor imaging and efficient sonodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Afterglow imaging uses delayed luminescence to suppress tissue autofluorescence and improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios for in vivo diagnostics and therapy. However, because afterglow induction typically requires external light, conventional photoactivated approaches remain suboptimal. Here, we report two hybrid molecular sonoafterglow luminophores that pair tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)3) as a sonosensitizer with a phenoxy&#8208;adamantylidene afterglow substrate: cRuPA and ncRuPA, which are connected via a conjugated alkyne and a nonconjugated amide linker, respectively. After ultrasound treatment, only ncRuPA produces a strong sonoafterglow. In cRuPA, rapid electron transfer across the conjugated alkyne cleaves the dioxetane intermediate before emission can occur, whereas the nonconjugated amide in ncRuPA blocks this transfer, stabilizing the dioxetane and enabling sustained luminescence. ncRuPA is further developed into an activatable probe (ncRuPAAPN) that selectively turns on its sonoafterglow in response to the cancer biomarker aminopeptidase N. ncRuPAAPN enables sensitive tumor imaging and mediates efficient sonodynamic therapy via ultrasound&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production. These Ru&#8208;based sonoafterglow probes represent the first hybrid sonoafterglow molecules and open new molecular&#8208;design routes toward cancer theranostics.

         <title>Harnessing RAFT Polymerization for Hierarchical Structuring of Thermosets by Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a solvent&#8208;free strategy for direct ink writing of hierarchically structured thermosets by harnessing RAFT polymerization throughout material fabrication. RAFT&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers self&#8208;assemble in a selective diacrylate crosslinking diluent to form shear&#8208;thinning inks and undergo end&#8208;group reactivation during photocuring, enabling covalent nanodomain anchoring, nanostructure retention, and high&#8208;fidelity printing of complex 3D architectures under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Integrating molecular self&#8208;assembly with additive manufacturing has opened new avenues for the direct production of thermosetting polymers with intricate geometries and tailored microstructures. The wide range of available chemical compositions enables diverse applications for the materials, including nanostructured porous materials, solid polymer electrolytes, and inorganic composites. Here, we introduce a novel concept by developing photocurable polymeric inks with precisely controlled nanostructures suitable for direct ink writing (DIW). In particular, amphiphilic block copolymers (BCPs) synthesized via reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization is combined with a crosslinker that also acts as a selective solvent, yielding inks with stable and well&#8208;ordered nanostructures. Upon photocuring of these inks, the nanostructures were largely preserved, and reinitiation of the RAFT end&#8208;groups during network formation covalently anchored the nanodomains to the matrix, thereby improving nanoscale morphology retention and enhancing mechanical performance. These inks exhibit shear&#8208;thinning behavior with rapid structural recovery after extrusion, enabling high&#8208;fidelity DIW. Our strategy offers a powerful route to precisely fabricating hierarchical thermosetting materials under ambient conditions, requiring no complex processing steps and specialized equipment. This work significantly broadens possibilities for designing advanced thermosetting materials with customizable architecture and enhanced functionalities.

Transient substrate&#8208;induced co&#8208;assembly between a lysine&#8208;rich peptide and Fmoc&#8208;glycine is reported in the Communication (e202511352) by David Y.W. Ng, Tanja Weil, and co&#8208;workers. The non&#8208;equilibrium nanostructure creates a reactive microenvironment enabling promiscuous amino&#8208;acid&#8208;driven hydrolysis and C&#9552;N condensation reactions. Cleavage of the labile Fmoc group triggers collapse of the assembly, illustrating how broad prebiotic catalysis could have emerged under kinetic control.

         <title>Bright Circularly Polarized Electrochemiluminescence from Heterobinuclear IrIII&#8211;AuI Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and bright circularly polarized electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL) is achieved in a class of enantiopure hetobinuclear iridium(III)&#8211;gold(I) complexes owing to the combination of high ECL efficiency with stability, good emission dissymmetry factor and high brightness, thus paving the way to the next&#8208;generation of bright CP&#8208;ECL probes.








Abstract
The development of efficient circularly polarized electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL) probes is still at its infancy and examples are still very limited. Yet, their achievement would enable gathering a readout that carries privileged information on the probe's chiral environment by monitoring luminescence polarization bias with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Notwithstanding, this is a highly challenging task and requires judicious chemical engineering of chiral ECL&#8208;active emitters. Herein, we aim at expanding the palette of CP&#8208;ECL luminophores by presenting a novel class of enantiopure heterobinuclear Ir(III)&#8211;Au(I) complexes, which are investigated thoroughly by means of chemical, structural, and (chiro&#8208;)optical techniques. The ground and excited state properties are also elucidated by using density functional theory (DFT) approaches including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) perturbation. The chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes display luminescence with a polarization bias of the emitted light that is function of the helical arrangement of the coordination sphere around the Ir(III) center. Overall, the photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;active complexes unraveled in this work combine unparallelly high photoluminescence quantum yield in the orange region, excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness up to 4.5&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with a notable ECL activity. Finally, these features provide emitters with CP&#8208;ECL efficiency that encompass remarkably by a factor 3.5 that of the well&#8208;known benchmark tris&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II).

         <title>Harnessing Colloidal Dispersion for Laccase&#8208;Driven Enzymatic Depolymerization of Polystyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polystyrene (PS), long considered non&#8208;degradable by biocatalytic pathways, can now be broken down under aqueous conditions using atmospheric air and a laccase&#8211;mediator system composed of a commercially available fungal enzyme and 1&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazole as small organic mediator. By formulating PS into stable colloidally nanoparticles, we unlock access for biocatalytic attack, leading to a drastic molar mass reduction. This mild, effective method opens new paths for sustainable plastic depolymerization without harsh chemicals or energy&#8208;intensive processes. 








Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most widely used synthetic polymers, with annual global production of around 20 million tons. However, its robust C&#9472;C backbone renders it highly recalcitrant to (bio)chemical depolymerization, and no sustainable re&#8208;/up&#8208;cycling method has yet been developed. Here, we establish a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the efficient depolymerization of PS under mild aqueous conditions, using a laccase&#8211;mediator system (LMS) composed of Trametes versicolor laccase, 1&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), and ambient oxygen. To overcome substrate accessibility issues, PS is formulated into colloidally stable nanoparticles, promoting interfacial remote biocatalysis. Under such conditions, up to 99.9% decrease in molar mass is achieved from an initial PS of over 2&#160;million g mol&#8722;1, synthesized by ab initio free&#8208;radical emulsion polymerization. This colloidal dispersion strategy is also effective for commercial PS and expanded PS waste processed by post&#8208;dispersion in surfactant&#8208;containing aqueous media. Mechanistic studies suggest that LMS&#8208;mediated depolymerization proceeds via HBT radical diffusion into PS nanoparticles, triggering hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;based oxidation and &#946;&#8208;scissions of PS chains. This approach provides an efficient method for PS depolymerization using aqueous conditions, ambient O2 and a native enzyme without harsh solvents or experimental conditions.

         <title>Interfacial Synthesis of Cs2PtCl6 Perovskite for Strong Coupling with V4C3Tx MXene Toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the bifunctional Cs2PtCl6@V4C3TX composite, together with its application in high&#8208;performance urea oxidation reaction (UOR) coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), demonstrate its potential for simultaneous clean energy production and organic pollutant remediation.








Abstract
A key innovation in this work is the development of a trapping method to synthesize perovskite Cs2PtCl6 nanoparticles at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface under ambient conditions. The resulting nanoscale Cs2PtCl6 particles are able to combine with various MXenes via PtCl62&#8722; units, among which V4C3TX MXene forms strongly coupled Cs2PtCl6@V4C3TX composites. Cs2PtCl6@V4C3TX exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), delivering a dramatically reduced overpotential of &#8764;39&#160;mV a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which outperforms the pristine V4C3TX, Cs2PtCl6, and other Cs2PtCl6@MXenes composites investigated. On the other hand, Cs2PtCl6@V4C3TX exhibits negligible oxygen evolution reaction, but remarkably high&#8208;performance urea oxidation reaction. The selective anodic reactivity simultaneously reduces the overall energy input required for HER. Comprehensive studies with other MXenes and their Cs2PtCl6 hybrids highlight the unique and critical role of V4C3TX in facilitating electron transfer and catalytic stability, paving the way for simultaneous production of clean energy and remediation of organic pollutants.

         <title>The Combination of Chiral Assembly and Chiral Template Effects Boosts Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that the hierarchical order of perovskite nanocrystal assemblies formed within a nanostructured, chal liquid&#8208;crystalline template exhibits extremely high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This is due to the helical arrangement of PNCs in the template voids and capitalizes on the inherent electrooptic properties of the template. Ultimately, this enables the fabrication of CPL&#8208;active thin films with practically relevant chiroptical functionality.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) represent a promising class of materials for display and light communication technologies, owing to their emission covering the entire visible range with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency. However, these materials suffer from low selectivity in the handedness of the emitted light, with most studies focusing on green emission. We address these issues by exploiting and broadening the scope of interactions between achiral PNCs and chiral organic templates. For this purpose, we select three types of PNCs with red, green, and blue emissions and introduce them into a chiral liquid&#8208;crystalline matrix in the form of composite thin films. Electron microscopy confirmed the assembly of PNCs within nanoscale gaps formed by supramolecular, liquid crystalline structures. The obtained composites displayed a CPL dissymmetry factor&#160;glum&#160;up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.24. The highly dissymmetric CPL properties were found to result from an interplay between two effects: chiral assembly of PNCs within a chiral environment (intrinsic) and the selective filtering by the chiral matrix. This system enables control over the dominant factors by adjusting the CPL spectral region and type of particle assembly, providing thin film materials with highly dissymmetric and spectrally tunable CPL responses.

         <title>Contact Electrification via Redox&#8208;Active Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel molecular design strategy to perform electronic charge transfer during contact electrification by functionalizing surfaces with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. To elucidate and quantify the underlying molecular&#8208;level electron transfer processes, we combine X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical analysis, density functional theory calculations, and an atomic force microscopy&#8208;based contact electrification assay. 








Abstract
Contact electrification, as the transfer of charge upon the contact of two (dis)similar materials, is strongly influenced by surface chemistry, which governs the efficiency of charge separation. For harvesting electrical energy from mechanical energy, material pairs with high electron&#8208;transfer efficiency are essential. Here, we introduce a strategy to use electronic charge transfer in contact electrification via surface functionalization with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. Specifically, we functionalize Au(111) surfaces with mercaptomethyl&#8208;terminated redox&#8208;active molecules, namely triphenylamine and tetrathiafulvalene as donors and 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane as an acceptor, achieving stable and covalent immobilization, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical characterization, and density functional theory calculations, and enabling molecular&#8208;level electron&#8208;transfer. To quantify charge transfer at the micrometer scale, we introduce a contact electrification assay combining atomic force microscopy&#8208;based force spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. This approach allows for a precise measurement of charge transfer between Au(111) surfaces functionalized with redox&#8208;active molecules, revealing an electron&#8208;driven mechanism capable of achieving surface charge densities of (120&#160;&#177;&#160;17)&#160;&#181;C m&#8722;2. Our findings deepen the fundamental understanding of contact electrification by demonstrating that electron transfer&#8212;depending on the choice of materials&#8212;can indeed be its origin, and pave the way for the development of more efficient triboelectric devices.

         <title>Regulating Promiscuous Catalysis via Substrate&#8208;Induced Transient Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel substrate&#8208;induced transient co&#8208;assembly between a short Lys&#8208;rich peptide and Fmoc&#8208;Gly&#8208;OH. In the activated state, the assembly exhibits promiscuous catalytic activity through the rate enhancements of hydrolysis and C&#9552;N condensation reactions. Over time, the substrate Fmoc&#8208;Gly&#8208;OH is cleaved into smaller fragments, leading to the collapse of the hydrogel and a decrease in catalytic activity.








Abstract
In nature, substrate&#8208;induced assembly is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of enzyme&#8208;driven chemical transformations. Systems chemists have introduced synthetic substrate analogues that have proven effective in enhancing catalytic activities of assembling peptide folds, and mimic primitive enzymes. However, how catalytic promiscuity, the ability of one catalyst to catalyse multiple orthogonal reactions, might have shaped the diversification of prebiotic chemistry, remains largely unaddressed. Herein, we report a novel transient, substrate&#8208;induced co&#8208;assembly between a lysine&#8208;rich pre&#8208;assembling peptide and Fmoc&#8208;glycine. The nanostructure formed under nonequilibrium conditions provides the suitable microenvironment to promote the potential of catalytically active amino acids, performing orthogonal hydrolysis and C&#9552;N condensation reactions. Simultaneously, carbamate bond cleavage of the labile Fmoc group destabilises the co&#8208;assembly in the activated state, causing the structure to collapse gradually. By encoding catalytic promiscuity into assembling building blocks under kinetic control, we shed light on the emergence of primitive catalysis with broad substrate scope at the origin of life.

         <title>Oxalate&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Fe(II) Drives Concerted Two&#8208;Electron Reduction of NO2 by Substantial Spin Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>In the environment, oxalic acid (OA) coordinates with iron species to form oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complexes. These complexes show unique antiferromagnetic interactions, enabling a previously unreported two&#8208;electron reduction pathway of NO2, in which NO2 is directly reduced to NO. This mechanism stands in sharp contrast to the conventionally single&#8208;electron reduction pathway, where NO2 is first reduced to nitrite. This discovery broadens the understanding of the nitrogen cycle's chemistry.


Abstract
NO2 reduction plays a key role in the active nitrogen cycle, influencing atmospheric oxidation capacity and secondary aerosol formation. NO2 reduction is commonly believed to proceed via a single&#8208;electron reduction pathway, yielding NO2&#8722; or HONO as primary products. Here, we report that oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complex can lead to the two&#8208;electron reduction of NO2 directly to NO, while the citrate&#8208;coordinated Fe(II) primarily reduces NO2 to HONO through the common single&#8208;electron reduction pathway. We systematically compare the coordination and magnetic properties between this oxalate&#8208;bridged Fe(II) complex with the citrate&#8208;coordinated one. Unlike the paramagnetic Fe(II) citrate complex with disordered Fe spin alignments, the oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complex exhibits antiferromagnetic interactions with antiparallel spin alignments of the unpaired electrons between the two Fe(II) centers. We propose that such antiferromagnetic interactions facilitate the concerted transfer of the two electrons with antiparallel spin alignments from each Fe(II) centers in the oxalate&#8208;bridged Fe(II) complex to the empty lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NO2, leading to NO formation. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a two&#8208;electron reduction pathway of NO2 by the oxalate&#8208;bridged binuclear Fe(II) complex formed from environmentally abundant iron oxides and oxalic acid, providing new insights into the active nitrogen cycling.

         <title>Sequential Heterolytic Carbon&#8208;Halide and Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Activation in Unactivated Piperidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organometallic cascade reaction of 4&#8208;halo&#8208; and 4,4&#8208;dihalopiperidines consisting of heterolytic C&#9472;F bond activation, fast ring opening of a short&#8208;lived carbocation toward a stabilized iminium ion, and final alkyl or aryl delivery from the concomitantly generated ate metal complex is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two cationic reaction intermediates trapped together in a single crystal provides a unique snapshot of this process.








Abstract
The thermodynamic stability of unactivated Csp3&#9472;F and Csp3&#9472;Csp3 bonds remains a major challenge in organic synthesis as methods that achieve effective cleavage and high&#8208;yielding functionalization under mild conditions are rare. Herein, we introduce a cascade reaction involving heterolytic activation of 4&#8208;halopiperidines with organoaluminum reagents which is followed by fast ring opening toward a thermodynamically favored iminium ion that undergoes C&#9472;C bond formation via aryl or alkyl transfer from a concomitantly generated fluoroaluminate counteranion. Fluoropiperidines were found to be more reactive than other halides and are smoothly transformed into tertiary homoallyl amines with good to excellent yields. This reaction occurs at room temperature with high functional group tolerance and without noticeable by&#8208;product formation. Similarly, Csp3&#9472;F bond scission is observed with 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidines, giving rise to monofluorinated alkene products as the Csp2&#9472;F bond generated during this process does not react. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of two cationic reaction intermediates simultaneously isolated in a single crystal provides a snapshot of the ring&#8208;opening process and together with chemical trapping and control experiments is in agreement with an ionic mechanism and a three&#8208;step reaction sequence. By contrast, defluorinative halide exchange leaving the piperidinyl ring intact prevails when 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidines are treated with aluminum trihalide Lewis acids.

A universal model describing photoreaction kinetics in dithienylethene (DTE) systems is presented. It enables reliable determination of photocyclization and photocycloreversion quantum yields under various conditions. It is applicable to a broad range of photoswitch concentrations and accounts for competitive reactions. Statistical treatment of the complete data series reduces the influence of individual measurement errors.








Abstract
A universal and flexible model fully describing photoreaction kinetics in dithienylethene (DTE) systems is presented. The proposed method enables reliable determination of photocyclization and photocycloreversion quantum yields at various conditions. Most importantly, it is applicable to a broad range of photoswitch concentrations and accounts for competitive reactions, such as annulation of the closed form. By employing both analytical and numerical solutions to the kinetic equations, we achieve consistent results: the numerical method ensures high accuracy in quantum yield determination, while the analytical method allows for the prediction of DTE photoreaction behavior. The robustness of the model was validated across four distinct DTE photoswitches under varying concentrations, solvents, excitation wavelengths conditions, demonstrating its broad applicability and reliability.

         <title>Minutes&#8208;Scale Ultrafast Synthesis of New Oxyhalides Solid Electrolytes with Interfacial Ionic Conduction for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oxyhalide solid electrolyte was synthesized in an ultrafast minutes&#8208;long process. Ta2O5, acting as a core&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;catalyst, drives the formation of a shell&#8208;like conductive amorphous oxyhalide, enabling an innovative interfacial conduction mechanism. Within this mechanism, bridging oxygen and non&#8208;bridging oxygen synergize with Ta&#9472;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Li coordination to optimize ion&#8208;transport pathways.








Abstract
Halide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) show exceptional promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet their dependence on prolonged ball milling to achieve required ionic conductivity critically compromises energy efficiency. Here, we report a novel Zr&#8208;based oxyhalide SSE (oh&#8208;LZC) synthesized via an ultrafast ball&#8208;milling process (18&#160;min)&#8212;a record for halide SSEs. Remarkably, extending processing to just 1.5&#160;h boosts ionic conductivity from 0.11 to 1.09&#160;mS cm&#8722;1&#8212;outperforming most reported Zr&#8208;based halides at equivalent synthesis durations. Critical to this advance is the strategic substitution of expensive Li2O with cost&#8208;effective Ta2O5 as the oxygen source&#8212;which simultaneously acts as a core&#8208;like pseudo&#8208;catalyst. During ultrafast milling, this drives formation of a shell&#8208;like conductive amorphous oxyhalide, directly enabling a novel interfacial conduction mechanism as confirmed by high&#8208;resolution microscopy and spectroscopy. ASSBs assembled with oh&#8208;LZC synthesized in 18&#160;min exhibit excellent compatibility with uncoated LiCoO2, delivering robust cycling stability (&gt;80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). Validated with alternative oxygen sources (Nb2O5), this pseudo&#8208;catalyst approach demonstrates versatility, pioneering accelerated synthesis protocols for halide SSEs and beyond.

         <title>Ring Strain&#8208;Promoted Activation of Pyridines by a Saturated BSi2 Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly strained boratadisilirane with the elusive anionic BSi2 ring motif. Cleavage of the Si&#9472;Si bond during reactions with pyridine derivatives activates them in three different ways: 1) for pyridine itself selective ortho&#8208;CH activation and concomitant hydrogen transfer to a second pyridine molecule occurs, 2) with dimethylaminopyridine, unprecedented C&#9472;C bond formation happens between the two DMAP equivalents, and 3) in pentafluoropyridine the para&#8208;CF bond is activated under formation of regioisomers.








Abstract
Ring strain is a well&#8208;established strategy to increase reactivity. Employing an elusive saturated BSi2 ring motif, we here exploit the size mismatch between boron and silicon to this end. The reaction of disilenide Tip2Si = SiTipLi with BH3&#183;SMe2 selectively affords the lithium salt of anionic boratadisilirane c&#8208;SiTip2SiHTipBH2&#8722; (Tip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), which according to DFT calculations on the parent system BSi2H6&#8722; is much more strained than isoelectronic analogues such as cyclopropane (C3H6), boratirane (BC2H6&#8722;), and cyclotrisilane (Si3H6). Indeed, it spontaneously and selectively activates a range of pyridine derivatives: pyridine itself undergoes ortho&#8208;CH activation under dearomatization of a second equivalent; 2 equivalents of para&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) are C&#9472;C&#8208;coupled in ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;position; and pentafluoropyridine (PFP) is CF&#8208;activated in para&#8208;position.

     alt="Ring Strain-Promoted Activation of Pyridines by a Saturated BSi2 Cycle"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a highly strained boratadisilirane with the elusive anionic BSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring motif. Cleavage of the Si&#9472;Si bond during reactions with pyridine derivatives activates them in three different ways: 1) for pyridine itself selective &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-CH activation and concomitant hydrogen transfer to a second pyridine molecule occurs, 2) with dimethylaminopyridine, unprecedented C&#9472;C bond formation happens between the two DMAP equivalents, and 3) in pentafluoropyridine the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-CF bond is activated under formation of regioisomers.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination with Electronically Enhanced Vibrational Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a practical workflow for simulating vibrational circular dichroism spectra enhanced by vibronic coupling. We achieve qualitative agreement with experiment for Co(II) and Ni(II) spartein complexes, circumventing inaccuracies in theoretical excitation energy predictions. We show that even with economical density functional theory, high VCD similarity scores can be reached, paving the way to absolute configuration assignment.








Abstract
Intensity enhancement in vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) arises in open&#8208;shell transition metal complexes from coupling between ground&#8208;state vibrational transitions and magnetic dipole&#8208;allowed transitions to low&#8208;lying excited states (LLESs). In this work, we apply Nafie's vibronic coupling theory to Me(II)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;sparteine&#8208;Cl2${\rm Cl}_2$ (Me&#160;=&#160;Zn, Co, Ni) complexes to investigate these enhancement effects. We show that the VCD intensity is extremely sensitive to the excitation energies that neither time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) nor state&#8208;averaged complete active space self&#8208;consistent field (SA&#8208;CASSCF) calculations can predict with sufficient accuracy. We argue that instead of using more accurate quantum chemistry methods these excitation energies can be treated as parameters and optimized against experimental spectra. With this approach, we obtain simulated VCD similarity scores above 0.4, a threshold considered reliable for absolute configuration assignment. The ability to quantitatively reproduce enhanced experimental spectra with computations opens up new research areas, offering amongst else unique possibilities for the study of the chiral structure of systems such as transition metal complexes and metalloproteins that so far have remained&#160;intractable.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding Enabled Ambient&#8208;Driven Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Salmonella's ion&#8208;binding driven motion, a supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with dynamic coordination crosslinks enables a coordination motorized oscillator (CoMO) that harvests low&#8208;grade thermal energy. Reversible metal&#8208;ligand bonding converts molecular transitions into macroscopic oscillation, powering collective motion and adaptive soft robots (CoMbots).








Abstract
Harnessing ambient low&#8208;density energy and converting it into macroscopic motion is a hallmark of living systems. However, artificial systems are often limited by high energy requirements and intricate control mechanisms. Inspired by Salmonella, which uses dynamic ion&#8208;binding coordination for continuous motion, we proposed a novel concept of self&#8208;oscillating motors leveraging molecular&#8208;level dynamic bonding to harvest trivial ambient energy and power macroscopic, self&#8208;sustained behavior. Specifically, we developed a coordination motorized oscillator (CoMO) based on novel supramolecular PDMS material with 25&#8208;fold thermo&#8208;inflation ability of normal PDMS and nearly 2000&#8208;fold that of the passive layer. CoMO can harvest ambient energy as low as body temperature to reversibly dissociate coordination crosslinks, transforming molecular transitions into sustained macroscopic oscillation. Its universality facilitates the amplification of macroscopic motion via the collective behaviors of CoMOs. Moreover, this principle empowers the development of ambient&#8208;driven coordination motored robots (CoMbot) with multi&#8208;modal locomotion and adaptability across diverse terrains. Such dynamic chemical transitions enabled chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling for self&#8208;sustained systems, paving new avenues for robust transition&#8208;mechanical transducing material systems and soft machineries with unprecedented capabilities.

         <title>Dynamics and Mechanism of Off&#8208; to On&#8208;Switching in Dreiklang a Decoupled Reversibly Switchable Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dreiklang is a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein with a unique photohydration/dehydration mechanism. Using complementary transient absorption and femtosecond&#8212;microsecond transient IR, we follow the off&#8208;to&#8208;on photo&#8208;dehydration. A multistep process is revealed, where a hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;picoseconds photoreaction is followed by microsecond structural reorganization, providing new mechanistic insight.








Abstract
Dreiklang is a reversibly switchable (rs) fluorescent protein (FP) with a unique off&#8208;state, a UV absorbing hydrated form of the typical FP chromophore. Here we report ultrafast dynamics of the off&#8208; to on&#8208;state transition in Dreiklang using complementary ultrafast optical and vibrational transient absorption to resolve chromophore driven protein structural dynamics. This approach allows observation of the real&#8208;time response in a protein to bond breaking and forming events. The excited electronic state decays in a nonsingle exponential fashion in tens to hundreds of picoseconds, undergoing photodehydration with a yield of several per&#8208;cent. The primary photoproduct formed is identified as the cis protonated form of the FP chromophore, initially in a perturbed H&#8208;bonded environment. This primary product relaxes on a few microseconds timescale by a mechanism involving changes to a glutamic acid residue and modifications of the amide backbone, possibly involving a carbonyl to imine tautomerization. The temporal and spectral resolution of Dreiklang's photodehydration provides data against which to test quantum chemical calculations of reaction dynamics in proteins and suggests a route to modifying and potentially enhancing its photoswitching properties.

         <title>Stereodivergent Access to C&#8208;N Atropisomers via Phosphonium Salt&#8208;Enabled Desymmetrizing Remote Cyclization/Aromatization Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and highly practical enantiodivergent approach has been developed for synthesizing axially chiral phthalimide derivatives in either enantiomeric form. This enantioselective divergence is induced by chiral phosphonium salt catalysts bearing identical stereogenic elements. The protocol's scalability and practicality were demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale synthesis and product derivatization, highlighting its significant application potential, particularly in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) for small organic molecules.








Abstract
In this study, we describe a highly efficient organocatalytic enantiodivergent method for synthesizing C&#8208;N axially chiral compounds via remote asymmetric cycloaddition/aromatization cascade. By leveraging formally remote stereocontrol from two classes of chiral phosphonium salts sharing identical stereogenic elements, prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides undergo asymmetric formal [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition/aromatization in an atropodivergent manner, affording structurally diverse C&#8208;N axially chiral products. This approach features broad substrate scope and enables practical, atom&#8208;economical synthesis of both enantiomeric configurations of C&#8208;N atropisomers under mild conditions, with high efficiency and excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, an unexpected synergistic desymmetrization/dynamic kinetic resolution process was observed in this transformation. Mechanistic studies elucidated the origin of stereochemical induction. Furthermore, the utility of enantioenriched products is demonstrated through downstream transformations and, specifically, in constructing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active C&#8208;N axially chiral organic small molecules, which may hold significant potential for chiral optoelectronic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficient Raman Enhancement on Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Stabilized Perovskite Heterostructures for Guiding Early Theranostics of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an organic semiconductor modified perovskite heterostructure, which exhibited high stability without compromising the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance of perovskites with a significant EF &gt;&#160;107. This system was developed as an integrated theranostic SERS platform for miR&#8208;146a monitoring with a detection limit down to 0.2&#160;fM, guiding early theranostics to enhance the therapeutic efficiency for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Perovskites have recently emerged as attractive optoelectronic semiconductors due to tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, and long carrier lifetime, making it ideal as a kind of chemical&#8208;mechanism based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. However, perovskites generally demonstrate poor stability at ambient conditions, limiting their applications for SERS bioanalysis. Herein, we created a perovskite&#8208;based heterostructure through effectively passivating defects at the interface with hydrophobic organic semiconductors, which simultaneously enhanced the stability and efficiency of perovskite SERS substrate. The significant enhancement factor of 107 was mainly stemmed from the resonance Raman effect and the highly&#8208;efficient charge transfer process driven by a novel light&#8208;induced hot electron transfer mechanism in plasmon&#8208;free substrates previously never reported. This system was subsequently developed as an integrated theranostic SERS platform for miR&#8208;146a monitoring with a detection limit down to 0.2&#160;fM, successfully guiding the early theranostics to enhance the therapeutic efficiency for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work brings new light into the design of efficient and stable semiconductor SERS substrate and opens novel diagnosis and treatment options for AD.

         <title>Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy for Photoinduced Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Using Cu(I)&#8208;Phenothiazine Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(I)&#8208;anchored photoactive two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) serve as both catalysts and radical producers to boost fast polymerization rates and ensure complete catalyst recycling in photoinduced ATRP, which is an almost impossible mission in conventional ATRP processing.








Abstract
The concurrent development of innovative photocatalysts (PCs) that achieve fast reaction rates while ensuring efficient catalyst recycling remains a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale polymer production. Herein, we present a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy that combines a photoactive component with a cyclic trinuclear Cu(I)&#8208;incorporated triangular complex as the intrinsic copper source within three imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As&#8208;synthesized photoactive Cu(I)&#8208;containing COFs demonstrated exceptional performance in aqueous photoinduced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo&#8208;ATRP), achieving a record&#8208;breaking turnover number (TON) of 1640 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 82 min&#8722;1, while maintaining narrow polymer dispersity of 1.20. Such performance surpasses previously reported heterogeneous PCs designed for photo&#8208;ATRP. Notably, the COF&#8208;encapsulated &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalytic design endows the system with remarkable operational stability and near&#8208;quantitative catalyst recovery. More importantly, such new COFs demonstrate outstanding process compatibility, enabling scalable production of well&#8208;defined block copolymers in a single microreactor, without intermediate purification.

         <title>Achieving Combined Photoluminescence and SHG in a New Polar Hybrid Glass&#8208;Ceramic with Square&#8208;Pyramidal [SbBr5] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By providing two textbook&#8208;style comparative examples of hybrid antimony(III) bromides, we obtained a rare hybrid antimony(III) bromide&#8212;based on square&#8208;pyramidal [SbBr5] monomers&#8212;that undergoes reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal transitions, and for the first time achieved the combined luminescence and nonlinear optical properties in its polar glass&#8208;ceramic.








Abstract
Hybrid glass&#8208;ceramics have garnered extensive research interest due to their exceptional optical properties. Integrating luminescence and second harmonic generation (SHG) in hybrid glass&#8208;ceramics is of particular interest for designing advanced devices, but is challenging owing to the lack of design principles. In this study, we present two textbook&#8208;style comparative examples of hybrid antimony(III) bromides, (PPTPP)2[Sb2Br8] (1) and (PPTPP)2[SbBr5] (2), where PPTPP+ = (3&#8208;phenylpropyl)(triphenyl)phosphonium. Compound 1 with centrosymmetric seesaw [Sb2Br8] dimers crystallizes in C2/c space group and is photoluminescently silent, whereas 2 with square&#8208;pyramidal [SbBr5] monomers crystallizes in polar P21 space group and exhibits photoluminescence under excitation at 416&#160;nm. Both 1 and 2 have higher thermostability with decomposition temperatures of 552&#160;K, and undergo crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass transitions upon heating and natural cooling, with melting temperatures of 445 and 484&#160;K and vitrification temperatures of 331 and 340&#160;K, respectively. Notably, the glassy sample of 2 exhibits an onset recrystallization temperature of 383&#160;K, enabling the facile fabrication of a polar glass&#8208;ceramic (2&#8208;GC) thin film under ambient conditions. Crucially, 2&#8208;GC present the first example of a hybrid glass&#8208;ceramic system integrating luminescence (centered at 691&#160;nm) and SHG (12.8 times stronger than that of its polycrystalline counterpart), pioneering an innovative route for designing multichannel materials.

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanine Provides PF5&#8208;Proteins as Phosphoprotein Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic code expansion with a unique hyper&#8208;fluorinated phosphotyrosine analog. In this work, we successfully incorporated the unnatural amino acid pentafluorophosphato&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;phenylalanine, carrying seven fluorine atoms and a permanent negative charge into three different proteins via the use of mutated orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases. Biological testing revealed the great potential of this approach for furnishing functional phosphoprotein mimetics. 








Abstract
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important posttranslational modifications altering the structure, stability, and activity of more than 13&#160;000 human proteins. In this work, the phosphotyrosine mimetic pentafluorophosphato&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;phenylalanine (PF5CF2Phe) was genetically encoded and incorporated into three different proteins. Screening two libraries of orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases identified enzymes enabling the efficient and specific incorporation of PF5CF2Phe into red fluorescent protein (RFP) via amber stop codon suppression. Two model proteins, human ubiquitin (Ubq) and the B1 immunoglobulin&#8208;binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1), were prepared with PF5CF2Phe mutations and investigated for potential interaction partners. While native GB1 showed no binding to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), PF5&#8208;GB1, with PF5CF2Phe at position 17, was a strong inhibitor of the phosphatases PTP1B and SHP2. PF5&#8208;Ubq was produced and converted into the first example of a protein carrying the most prominent phosphotyrosine mimetic, phosphono&#8208;difluoromethyl phenylalanine (PO3CF2Phe). With increasing need in the biosciences to delineate the functions of complex phosphorylation patterns, genetic encoding of PF5CF2Phe yielding phosphoprotein mimetics opens unique opportunities for precise functional studies where site&#8208;specific and homogeneous protein modifications are required.

         <title>Activate 1&#8208;TM Channel of Disordered Rock Salts via Electrostatic Repulsion Regulation for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although cation&#8208;disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathodes show great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their practical application has been hindered by sluggish Li+ transport kinetics, as Li+ migration is typically confined to 0&#8208;transition&#8208;metal (0&#8208;TM) channels. In this work, we propose a dual&#8208;functional electrostatic repulsion regulation strategy to activate 1&#8208;TM Li+ transport channels, thereby constructing kinetically favorable long&#8208;range Li&#8314; diffusion pathways.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) has emerged as a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, its practical deployment is hindered by intrinsic Li+ diffusion mechanism, where only 0&#8208;transition metal (0&#8208;TM) channels permit feasible Li&#8314; migration while 1&#8208;TM and 2/3/4&#8208;TM channels exhibit prohibitively high Li+ diffusion energy barriers. Here, we leverage electrostatic repulsion regulation to activate the 1&#8208;TM channel, which holds the highest potential for activation while constrained by restrictive tetrahedral site geometries, thereby introducing more Li+ diffusion pathways and establishing a well&#8208;connected percolating 3D Li+ diffusion network within the DRX lattice to fundamentally addressing the kinetic limitations of DRX. Systematic investigations reveal that in the optimized sample, the tetrahedral height of 1&#8208;TM channels increased significantly from 2.525 to 2.613 &#197;, concomitant with a volumetric expansion from 3.254 to 4.010 &#197;3, along with the Li+ migration energy barrier significantly reduced from 1.48 to 0.26 eV. The enhanced Li+ transport kinetics yield enhanced capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 mA g&#8722;1), alongside superior rate capability (&#8764;200 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1). This work establishes a material design paradigm overcome transport bottlenecks in disordered cathode architectures.

         <title>Iridium Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Rearrangement of Oxindoles with Aryl Diazoesters: Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Tertiary 2&#8208;Indolyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored &#946;&#8208;aryl axially chiral iridium porphyrin catalyzes the site&#8208;selective asymmetric rearrangement of oxindoles with aryl diazoesters, bypassing the inherent C3 nucleophilicity of oxindoles. Through enantioselective carbonyl ylide formation, epoxidation, and rearrangement, this approach delivers diverse chiral tertiary 2&#8208;indolyl alcohols in up to 99% yield and 93% ee.








Abstract
The asymmetric functionalization of indoles at the C2 position to afford chiral tertiary alcohols poses a formidable challenge in organic synthesis, primarily due to the inherent preference for C3 reactivity. Herein, we report the asymmetric generation and transformation of carbonyl ylides from oxindoles using a &#946;&#8208;aryl axially chiral iridium porphyrin complex. This system enables a highly site&#8208;selective and enantioselective reaction between oxindoles and aryl diazoesters, involving enantioselective carbonyl ylide formation, tandem epoxidation, and rearrangement. The process efficiently provides a series of chiral tertiary 2&#8208;indolyl alcohols that are difficult to access via direct Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles.

         <title>Acinetobacter baumannii &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;Legionaminyltransferase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis Reveals Legionaminic Acid Form Selectivity by Antibodies in Pooled Human IgGs</title>

The study reports the first biochemical characterization of a legionaminyltransferase (LegT) and its application in synthesis. Acinetobacter baumannii K8 strain AbGtr18 is a donor substrate promiscuous &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;LegT selective toward GalNAc&#945;OR acceptors. Its application in constructing a focused library of glycosides with varied nonulosonic acid (NulO) forms reveals selective recognition of naturally occurring legionaminic acid forms by antibodies in IVIG.








Abstract
Legionaminic acids (Legs) are prokaryote&#8208;specific nine&#8208;carbon acidic monosaccharides belonging to the nonulosonic acid (NulO) family. Various Leg forms are found in the polysaccharides or glycoproteins produced by numerous pathogenic bacteria, including capsular polysaccharides of carbapenem&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Hypothetic legionaminyltransferases have been predicted from gene sequences but none has been biochemically validated. In this study we report the first biochemical characterization of a legionaminyltransferase. We demonstrate&#160;that AbGtr18 from an A. baumannii K8 strain is a donor promiscuous &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;legionaminyltransferase selective for &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine&#8208;glycoside (GalNAc&#945;OR) acceptors. In addition, streamlined chemical synthetic routes, including regio&#8208;selective triflylation and azide substitution processes, were developed to prepare precursors or chemoenzymatic synthons of various forms of Legs. Applying the novel &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;legionaminyltransferase AbGtr18 in one&#8208;pot multienzyme (OPME) synthesis with or without additional chemical derivatization enabled rapid construction of a focused library of NulO&#8208;glycosides (NulO&#945;2&#8211;6GalNAc&#945;OR) containing nine NulO forms. Binding and inhibition studies with these compounds revealed selective Leg forms recognized by the antibodies in the pooled human immunoglobulin (IgGs), reflecting natural occurrence of these Leg forms and indicating their prior encounters by human immune systems. AbGtr18 thus emerges as both a potential target for antibiotic development and a powerful biocatalyst for accessing synthetically challenging NulO&#8208;glycosides with therapeutical potentials.

         <title>Programmable Pulsed Acidic Water Oxidation for Enhanced H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to traditional constant potential electrolysis (CPE), pulse potential electrolysis (PPE) regulates the catalyst's surface microenvironment, thereby significantly improving the preparation of H2O2 through the water oxidation reaction in acidic systems.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high&#8208;value, eco&#8208;friendly chemical with significant medical and industrial applications. H2O2 electrosynthesis via water oxidation reaction (WOR) in acidic environments is crucial yet challenging. In this study, we introduce a novel approach by employing programmable pulse potential electrolysis (PPE) with machine learning (ML) optimization to synthesize H2O2 in acidic conditions using a Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) catalyst. This approach achieved a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 64.16% and a H2O2 production rate of 25.62&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 min&#8722;1, which represents a 28.9&#8208;fold increase in FE and a 51.8&#8208;fold boost in H2O2 yields in comparison to constant potential electrolysis (CPE). Furthermore, it was revealed that H2O2 generation influenced by the nonFaradaic current stage at the anode. Meanwhile, hydrogenation processes at the cathode increase the abundance of C&#9472;H functional groups on the surface of BDD catalyst, which in turn enhances the production of H2O2. The findings also confirm that H2O2 is produced through a step involving &#8226;OH radical formation, as supported by both experimental observations and DFT simulations. This study not only demonstrates the significant potential of PPE in WOR but also underscores the powerful role of ML in optimizing complex multi&#8208;parameter experimental conditions.

         <title>Homogenizing Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers via Covalent Organic Frameworks for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A COF&#8208;modified SAM homogenization strategy was developed to address the critical issue of molecular aggregation and poor interfacial quality in MeO&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based inverted PSCs. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between COFs and MeO&#8208;4PACz effectively prevent aggregation, enhancing the charge transport and substrate wettability. PSCs employing Zn&#8208;PT&#8208;COF exhibit a champion PCE of 26.39% (certified as 26.12%) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have emerged as promising hole transport layers (HTLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their unique capability to modulate energy level alignment and interfacial quality. However, the widely used SAM molecule [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;4PACz) suffers from molecular aggregation, poor wettability with perovskite precursors, and limited electrical conductivity, which together hinder the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient charge extraction. Herein, we propose a rational SAM homogenization strategy by introducing two tailor&#8208;designed covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;PT&#8208;COF and Zn&#8208;PT&#8208;COF&#8212;into MeO&#8208;4PACz SAMs via co&#8208;assembly. These COFs are designed with rigid porphyrin cores to enhance charge transport and flexible hydrophilic side chains to improve substrate wettability. The incorporation of COFs effectively disrupts MeO&#8208;4PACz aggregation through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding, resulting in uniform, conductive, and well&#8208;anchored SAMs. Consequently, the modified SAMs promote perovskite crystallization, reduce buried interface defects, and improve charge extraction. Devices employing Zn&#8208;PT&#8208;COF&#8208;modified SAMs exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.39% (certified as 26.12%) with negligible hysteresis and outstanding operational stability, retaining 95% of initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h continuous operation. This study offers a comprehensive molecular&#8208;level strategy to overcome intrinsic limitations of MeO&#8208;4PACz, providing a pathway for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Through Stronger Hindrance to Higher Reactivity: Influence of the Alkyl Chains on the Activation Energy of Ether Cleavage on Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
For ether cleavage on Si(001), steric hindrance by the side chains was shown to determine the reactivity on the surface. In contrast to a simple expectation, the stronger steric hindrance of the butyl group in butyl methyl ether leads to a lower activation energy for ether cleavage on Si(001) when compared to diethyl ether. This effect was traced back to different degrees of destabilization of the precursor and the transition state.








Abstract
Reactivity in surface chemistry is often discussed in terms of the interaction between surface states and the functional groups of the reacting molecule. Herein, we demonstrate that for finite submonolayer coverage, i.e., surface coverage at which the molecular adsorbates cannot be treated as isolated molecules anymore, the seemingly innocent side chains of the adsorbate can also play a decisive role. For the example of ether cleavage on Si(001), which represents the surface analogue of an SN${\rm S}_{\rm N}$2&#8208;type reaction, we show both experimentally and based on ab initio calculations that steric hindrance by the side chains determines the activation energy for C&#8208;O dissociation into the final state. In contrast to a simple expectation, the stronger steric hindrance of the butyl group in butyl methyl ether leads to a lower activation energy for ether cleavage on Si(001) when compared to diethyl ether. This effect was traced back to different degrees of destabilization of the precursor and the transition state. Given the fact that for almost all technologically relevant processes the surface coverage is typically above the isolated&#8208;molecule limit, our findings are of general importance for surface functionalization and can help to properly design future&#160;experiments.

         <title>One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Carbon&#8211;Halide Bond Activation at a Phosphorus Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenaphosphanorcaradiene complex enables phosphorus&#8208;centered C&#9472;X bond activation through four distinct pathways: SN2 and SNAr substitutions, E2 elimination, and radical C&#9472;C coupling. By mimicking transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like one&#8208;electron (1e) and two&#8208;electron (2e) processes, this platform provides both mechanistic insight into phosphorus redox chemistry and a modular route to trisubstituted phosphines.








Abstract
The activation of small molecules by main&#8208;group elements has garnered significant attention as a potential alternative to transition metal catalysis. While transition metals excel in switching between single&#8208;electron (1e) and two&#8208;electron (2e) pathways due to their accessible d&#8208;orbitals, such switchability remains uncommon for main&#8208;group elements. In this work, we report the phosphorus&#8208;centered selective activation of various organohalides by phosphorus&#8208;atom transfer reaction of metallophosphanorcaradiene complex, which presents four distinct modes, SN2 or SNAr&#8208;type substitution, E2 elimination, or reductive radical coupling via halogen&#8208;atom transfer. These reactivities selectively show 1e or 2e pathways depending on the substrate, mimicking oxidative addition and radical activation steps traditionally reserved for transition metals. These divergent modes of reactivity are enabled by the substantial orbital interactions between the single phosphorus atom center and [Cp*(Idipp)(CO)Ru] fragment, which can be viewed as a metalloligand, allowing for switchable reactivities between 2e and 1e pathways. Furthermore, this platform enables the modular synthesis of phosphines bearing three different substituents through a &#8220;P&#160;+&#160;2E&#160;+&#160;Nu&#8221; strategy, establishing a new phosphorus&#8208;atom transfer route to organophosphorus molecules (E&#160;=&#160;electrophile; Nu&#160;=&#160;nucleophile).

         <title>Photoactivatable Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional photoswitches undergo reversible transitions between two thermodynamically stable states upon irradiation at two distinct wavelengths. A hydrazone&#8208;photoswitch precursor is now introduced that can be converted in situ to an active photoswitch upon photoirradiation. The photoactivation and photoisomerization pathways can be precisely and independently controlled by switching the wavelength of the light.








Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules enable on&#8208;demand generation of active species via external light stimulation, allowing for precise spatiotemporal control over their activation. Molecular photoswitches, which typically undergo reversible transitions between two thermodynamically stable states upon irradiation with distinct wavelengths, are highly valuable tools with broad utility in different research areas. Herein, we introduce a new class of photoactivatable photoswitches: the switchable molecules are designed to undergo initial photochemical activation from a stable precursor upon irradiation at &#955;1, generating active photoswitches that exhibit reversible isomerization when irradiated with two other wavelengths (&#955;2 and &#955;3) of light. Crucially, neither &#955;2 nor &#955;3 alone activates the photoswitch precursor, ensuring temporal and orthogonal control over both activation and switching processes. This photoactivatable system operates through a sequential photochemical pathway that involves a photoinduced tetrazole&#8211;hydrazone transformation, followed by E/Z photoisomerization of the resulting hydrazone motif. Upon irradiation at &#955;1, the diaryl tetrazole precursor undergoes rapid photolysis with concomitant nitrogen extrusion, generating a reactive nitrile imine (NI) intermediate. This intermediate subsequently undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic addition to furnish the hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch in situ. Notably, strategic incorporation of heteroatoms within the molecular architecture significantly enhances the thermal stability of both E/Z isomers by facilitating intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Binary&#8208;Doped Narrowband Blue OLEDs Enabled by a Single&#8208;Component Host Matrix with a Spatial Bipolarity Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of constructing the spatial bipolarity hosts is proposed by connecting boron&#8211;oxygen and carbazole&#8208;derived groups with a silyl linker. The binary&#8208;doped narrowband blue devices feature an emission peak at 472&#160;nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 42.3% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off, and an operational half&#8208;lifetime of 3076&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are vital for high&#8208;definition displays, yet the achievement of such devices via a concise binary&#8208;doped fabrication architecture remains challenging. Herein, an effective and robust single&#8208;component host matrix with a spatial bipolarity configuration is developed for high&#8208;performance OLEDs. Two elaborately designed molecules are constructed on a non&#8208;conjugated silyl linker connecting boron&#8211;oxygen and carbazole&#8208;derived groups. The boron&#8211;oxygen electron&#8208;accepting and carbazole&#8208;based electron&#8208;donating moieties exhibit synergistic and complementary group functions, achieving wide bandgaps of excited energy states, along with thermally activated delayed fluorescence and bipolar carrier transport features. Following the incorporation of a blue multiresonant guest emitter, the doped emissive film showcases enhanced horizontal orientation and photoluminescent efficiency. The binary&#8208;doped narrowband blue OLEDs achieve the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 42.3% with low roll&#8208;off (efficiency of 38.3% at 1,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2), and the improved operational stability with a half&#8208;lifetime of 3076&#160;h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This study reveals that the utilization of a spatial bipolarity host matrix is a promising approach to realize narrowband blue OLEDs with concise architecture and high performance.

         <title>Cryogenic Carbon Monoxide Oxidation on Cuprous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconstructed Cu2O surface with pyramidal units (PY) contains both adsorption and reaction sites for CO oxidation. A suite of spectroscopy techniques and calculations were used to characterize the fundamental surface chemistry occurring below 100&#160;K, where typically a metal/oxide interface is required. This earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide shows that local surface ensembles of atoms can vary in reactivity.








Abstract
Performing oxidation reactions at low temperatures using earth&#8208;abundant materials is crucial for advancing solutions for sustainable chemistry. CO oxidation serves as a benchmark reaction to characterize oxidation and to advance fundamental concepts in surface chemistry. While there are several examples of CO oxidation occurring on metal oxides at low temperatures, from 300&#160;K to &#8764;200&#160;K, reactivity in the cryogenic temperature regime typically requires a metal nanoparticle on a metal oxide. Here, we show oxygen atoms on the (111) facet of Cu2O react with CO to form CO2 at temperatures below 100&#160;K. Combining spectroscopic experimental evidence with calculations, we propose a low barrier path for CO oxidation at reconstructed surface sites on Cu2O(111). This finding is a rare example of an earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide, in this case copper, that can provide highly reactive multifunctional sites, enabling both adsorption and reaction fundamental steps toward the efficient heterogeneous oxidation of chemicals.

         <title>Grafting Cell&#8208;Penetrating Poly(disulfide)s to Substrates of Interest: Dynamic Covalent Bioconjugation for Traceless Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting&#8208;to rather than the grafting&#8208;from strategy envisioned 10 years ago is shown to make cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s compatible with dynamic covalent bioconjugation at high dilution (50&#160;nM) and top rates (1500&#160;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1), genetic engineering and transduction domains, that is traceless tags for protein delivery, including intact functional anti&#8208;NPC antibodies.








Abstract
Although increasingly understood and appreciated, thiol&#8208;mediated uptake (TMU) remains underused because practical traceless tags that solve daily delivery problems are not yet available. The most popular cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs) were initially introduced as traceless tags that could be grafted from any thiol&#8208;containing substrate of interest (SOI) in situ and would depolymerize in the cytosol right after uptake. This approach was operational but not ideal for solving practical problems because the concentrations of SOIs &gt;30&#160;&#181;M needed in neutral water are above those acceptable in most biological studies. Here, we report that CPD grafting&#8208;to SOIs, rather than grafting&#8208;from, provides access to dynamic covalent cysteine bioconjugation with protein concentrations down to 50&#160;nM, which is more than 600 times below standard grafting&#8208;from CPD chemistry. With rate constants up to 1500 M&#8722;1s&#8722;1, CPD grafting&#8208;to is as fast as the record covalent cysteine bioconjugation (heteroaromatic sulfones), in the range of the best bioorthogonal reaction (IEDDA), and 3000 times faster than cystine grafting&#8208;to. Experimental evidence for CPD grafting to probes, peptides and proteins with one, two, or several proximal thiols, efficient TMU of their conjugates, and the cytosolic release of functional SOIs, such as fluorescent antibodies against the nuclear pore complex, supports the discovery of operational traceless TMU tags, at last.

         <title>Engineering Heterocyclic Linkages to Expand the Structural and Functional Diversity of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in heterocycle&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks, focusing on de novo synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modification strategies as well as their physiochemical properties and representative applications.








Abstract
Heterocycle&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (HC&#8208;COFs) are a promising class of crystalline porous polymers constructed by linking organic modules into extended structures via heterocyclic moieties. HC&#8208;COFs have received considerable attention due to their robust linkages, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and abundant heteroatomic sites. These intrinsic characteristics endow HC&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability, enhanced light&#8208;harvesting ability, and tunable redox activity, thus making them promising systems for widespread applications such as separation, catalysis, sensing, luminescence, biomedicine, energy storage, and environmental remediation. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of de novo synthesis and post&#8208;synthetic modification strategies employed for the production of HC&#8208;COFs, along with their physicochemical properties and representative applications. Finally, we highlight the future opportunities and challenges of HC&#8208;COFs for next generation functional materials. This review would offer an insightful understanding of the subtle interplay between heterocyclic linkages and overall skeleton, thus providing a useful guidance on how to further solve the COF trilemma regarding crystallinity, stability and functionality.

         <title>Three Conformations, Four Stimuli: Balancing Bond Order and Aromaticity in a Dual&#8208;BN Dihydrophenazine Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three states, four inputs: a diborylated dihydrophenazine (BNNB) links aromaticity changes to B&#9472;N bond rotations, giving bent, intermediate, and planar conformations. Heat, force, light, or redox changes select the states and yield distinct optical signals, including extremely Stokes&#8208;shifted emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. 








Abstract
Designing &#960; systems that respond to several stimuli or switch among multiple conformations remains challenging. A diborylated dihydrophenazine, in which aromaticity changes are coupled to internal B&#9472;N rotations, operates as a multistate optical switch addressable by heat, force, light, or redox inputs. The system exemplifies a new route to &#960;&#8208;conjugated multimodal switches, as reported by Tian et&#160;al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70012).

The cover shows a chameleon symbolizing the ability of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) to perform different reactions under changing conditions. As a chameleon shifts color with its environment, ADHs alter their catalytic activity. The enzyme is depicted forming an aldehyde, amide, or thioester. In the Research Article (e202515469), Francesco G. Mutti and co&#8208;workers show that some ADHs catalyze oxidative coupling of primary alcohols with amines, H2S, or thiols, enabling efficient synthesis of diverse amides, thioacids and thioesters.

The Ag&#8211;Cu dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom pairs on a graphitic carbon nitride surface achieve spatial decoupling of adsorption and transformation functions. The Cu1 acts as a Lewis acid center to adsorb and activate nitrate ion, while the neighboring Ag1 site serves as a dedicated hydrogenation center to rapidly convert *NO into NH3. This atomic&#8208;level spatially decoupled tandem mechanism remarkably enhances reaction selectivity, achieving highly efficient ammonia production.

         <title>Transferring Porosity Across Physical States Using Metal&#8211;Organic Cages: Porous Liquids, Glasses, Rubbers, and More</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete porous metal&#8211;organic cages provide a platform to extend porosity beyond crystalline solids. Their peripheral functionality governs inter&#8208;cage interactions and physical state, enabling preservation of intrinsic porosity across liquids, glasses, and rubbers. This minireview explores how such control unlocks unique porous states with emerging properties and applications.








Abstract
The development of porous materials that retain tailored porosity across different physical states beyond crystalline solids (e.g., liquid or glassy) could yield new functional materials for diverse applications, yet it remains challenging. To address this, researchers have turned to discrete porous cages such as metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs). The organization and physical state of these materials are governed by inter&#8208;cage interactions that can be modulated without altering the intrinsic porosity of the individual cages. In this minireview, we highlight how the peripheral functionality of such cages governs their interactions and physical state and explain how it can be harnessed to preserve and transfer porosity across distinct physical states, including liquids, glasses, and rubbers. We conclude by outlining emerging properties and potential applications for the resultant unique porous states.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an in&#8208;depth overview and guide to the origin, modulation, and dynamics of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in TiO2&#8208;based catalysts for optimizing catalysis. It explores the functions of oxygen vacancies, surface/alloy formation energies, and TiO2 structural/thermal aspects. The benefits of pre&#8208;SMSI conditions, the changing dynamics of SMSI in catalysis, challenges, and future directions are highlighted.








Abstract
The concept of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), a topic of investigation for over four decades, remains an important area of research in heterogeneous catalysis. While substantial progress has been made in understanding SMSI across various metal/support systems, its complexity continues to evolve. TiO2, recognized as the first support material to exhibit SMSI, has been instrumental in advancing this understanding. However, the lack of a comprehensive guide on how various factors influence SMSI on TiO2 has limited the ability to systematically control these interactions. This review seeks to provide a consolidated view of the current understanding of SMSI in TiO2&#8208;supported metal catalysts. It highlights the sensitivity of SMSI on TiO2 to a range of parameters, including pretreatment conditions and reaction environments. The dynamic nature of SMSI under reaction conditions is also explored, underscoring its complexity and potential for fine&#8208;tuning catalyst performance. Additionally, practical insights into innovative chemical methods for controlling SMSI on TiO2 are discussed, offering strategies for modulating SMSI to meet specific catalytic requirements. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to offer a valuable guide for the rational design of metal/TiO2 catalysts, ultimately contributing to a more refined and controllable approach to SMSI on TiO2.

         <title>The Highest Oxidation States of the Rare&#8208;Earth Elements and the Challenge of Praseodymium(+5) Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare Earth Elements are known to form tri&#8208; and also di&#8208;valent compounds. A few tetra&#8208;valent compounds are also known, and recently the first molecules and crystals with Praseodymium(+5) were synthesized. By defining the atomic Ionization Quotient IQ, Ln(+4) compounds with suitable ligands appear possible for almost all 4f elements, while Pr(+5) may remain the pentavalent exception.








Abstract
Oxidation&#8208;State is one of the most important heuristic concepts in modern practical and theoretical chemistry. Its exploration deepens our understanding of both this concept as well as some fundamental properties of the element families. However, the well&#8208;defined oxidation state of the IUPAC leads to discussions in borderline cases, where conceptual clarity and detailed knowledge of the electronic structure are required. Our review focuses on the high oxidation states of the intriguing case of the 17 rare&#8208;earth elements (REEs: Sc, Y, La&#9472;Lu), with particular attention to the&#160;+&#160;5 oxidation state in some new praseodymium compounds. We provide a comprehensive overview from early speculation to the first identification of Pr(+5) in the gas phase to its recent molecular and solid compounds. We explain why high&#8208;valent REE compounds are so difficult to synthesize, from the perspective of atomic 4f valence orbital radii and energies. The predicted and synthesized Pr(+5) compounds with F, O, or N ligands pave the way for the development of new complexes and extended periodic networks in the field of highly&#8208;oxidized rare&#8208;earth chemistry. Our aim is to summarize current knowledge, distill emerging insights, and offer a roadmap for future investigations into the higher oxidation states of these elements.

         <title>Microcondensate&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Infusion of mRNA Across the Plasma Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delivery of mRNA without lipid nanoparticles remains challenging. FcB(L17E)3&#8208;driven microcondensates with nucleic acids, aided by short ssDNA, enable coacervate formation, actin&#8208;dependent cytosolic infusion, and in vivo protein expression, offering a potential platform for next&#8208;generation mRNA therapeutics and vaccination.








Abstract
This study presents a strategy for developing micrometer&#8208;sized coacervates comprised of cationic intracellular delivery peptide FcB(L17E)3 and nucleic acids (termed &#8220;microcondensates&#8221;) as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;free platform for intracellular messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. This approach is based on our previous finding that FcB(L17E)3 forms a microcondensate through interactions with IgG labeled with a negatively charged fluorescent dye. Similarly, the negative charge of nucleic acids causes siRNAs to form microcondensates with FcB(L17E)3, resulting in the facile infusion of the siRNAs through the plasma membrane with 40% gene knockdown efficiency. mRNAs form aggregates with FcB(L17E)3 due to their longer chains, which prevents efficient delivery. Remarkably, adding short single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) to mRNA enables microcondensate formation with FcB(L17E)3, facilitating protein expression. Additionally, this microcondensate system successfully facilitated the intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) by optimizing the charge ratio between FcB(L17E)3 and nucleic acids. Finally, the subcutaneous injection of microcondensates into mice successfully induced protein expression in vivo. The achievement of in vivo mRNA delivery and protein expression using microcondensates may offer a strategy for nucleic acid delivery with potential applicability in cancer immunotherapy and mRNA&#8208;based vaccination.

         <title>Integrating Sorbents in CO2 Electroreduction: A Model System to Disentangle Layer Contributions in Membrane Electrode Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are essential for upscaling of CO2 electroreduction but pose challenges for mechanistic studies due to their complex, multilayered architecture. This work introduces a planar interdigitated electrode array as a simplified model system to decouple transport and reaction processes. Using a silica/ionic liquid sorbent electrolyte, the study identifies diffusion and sorption kinetics as reactant supply limitations and provides design guidelines for scalable, gas&#8208;phase MEA architectures with improved reactant delivery and product release.








Abstract
Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are crucial in high&#8208;performance CO2 electrolysis, reducing iR losses and overcoming low solubility issues by supplying CO2 in the gas form. However, liquid anolyte permeation to the cathode causes salt precipitation, stability issues, and parasitic H2 evolution, hindering industrial implementation. Full gas&#8208;phase operation could mitigate these problems, but a model system to study gas&#8208;phase concepts is&#160;lacking.
This study presents a planar bimetallic interdigitated electrode array (BIDEA) as a model system, using a sorbent electrolyte for CO2 electroreduction as a case study. The simplified system, combined with numerical models, reveals key process limitations, such as diffusion over the material and the role of sorption kinetics in limiting CO2 supply to the cathode. Spectroscopic analysis provided mechanistic insights, demonstrating the model system's applicability to disentangle layer effects in integrated&#160;systems.

         <title>In situ Crystal Structure Growth and Control for Enhancing Comprehensive Performance in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel&#8208;Layered Lithium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special ultra&#8208;high nickel&#8208;layered cathode LiNi0.91Co0.045Mn0.045O2 with gapped internal structure as well as surface rock&#8208;salt phase is achieved based on an in situ growth method and a multistep sintering strategy, which exhibits enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transport dynamics and improved cycle stability.








Abstract
The ultra&#8208;high nickel&#8208;layered cathodes, LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.9), featuring high energy density and low cost, have been the exploration and application targets for the next&#8208;generation batteries. Current ultra&#8208;high nickel cathodes fail to meet the commercial demands, owing to the structure degradation during cycle. Additionally, the dense structure of traditional secondary particles restricts the migration of Li+ and further limits the capacity and rate performance. In this work, we focus on modulating intrinsic structure and morphology of cathodes originating from in situ growth method and have further controllably synthesized a special ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode with gapped structure and thin surface rock&#8208;salt phase (G&#8208;Ni91). Compared to the traditional dense&#8208;structure cathode (D&#8208;Ni91), G&#8208;Ni91 delivers better performance in all aspects, whether it is initial capacity, cycle stability, rate performance, high&#8208;voltage operation, and high&#8208;temperature condition. Multiscale characterizations manifests that smaller primary particle size, gapped interspace and less Li+/Ni2+ antisite in G&#8208;Ni91 supply enhanced Li+ transport dynamics. Moreover, the thin surface rock&#8208;salt phase and more uniform primary particles are regarded as contributions to the improved cycling stability. This work provides a feasible original intrinsic structural design and modification from precursor to cathodes, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance of ultra&#8208;high nickel&#8208;layered cathodes.

&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.9), featuring high energy density and low cost, have been the exploration and application targets for the next-generation batteries. Current ultra-high nickel cathodes fail to meet the commercial demands, owing to the structure degradation during cycle. Additionally, the dense structure of traditional secondary particles restricts the migration of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and further limits the capacity and rate performance. In this work, we focus on modulating intrinsic structure and morphology of cathodes originating from in situ growth method and have further controllably synthesized a special ultra-high nickel cathode with gapped structure and thin surface rock-salt phase (G-Ni91). Compared to the traditional dense-structure cathode (D-Ni91), G-Ni91 delivers better performance in all aspects, whether it is initial capacity, cycle stability, rate performance, high-voltage operation, and high-temperature condition. Multiscale characterizations manifests that smaller primary particle size, gapped interspace and less Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; antisite in G-Ni91 supply enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport dynamics. Moreover, the thin surface rock-salt phase and more uniform primary particles are regarded as contributions to the improved cycling stability. This work provides a feasible original intrinsic structural design and modification from precursor to cathodes, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance of ultra-high nickel-layered cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Hydrophobicity with Water Enables Ultrafast Hydrolysis of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate at Very Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entrapping water within the microstructure of hydrophobic PET unlocks ultrafast hydrolysis under remarkably mild conditions. The approach demonstrates a rare combination of high chemical efficiency, low environmental burden, and strong potential for scale&#8208;up &#8212; significantly advancing the prospects for sustainable recycling of condensation polymers.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of plastics holds great promise but remains constrained by sustainability issues, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) epitomizing this challenge. Herein, we introduce a conceptually novel strategy that overcomes PET's intrinsic hydrophobicity by physically re&#8208;engineering the polymer's microstructure to enable ultrafast alkaline hydrolysis under exceptionally mild conditions. We leverage the ability of propylene carbonate (PC)&#8212;an inexpensive, commercial, green solvent&#8212;to selectively dissolve PET, to thermally induce phase separation, and subsequently act as a carrier for water insertion between polymer chains. Upon complete PC replacement, the water uptake exceeds twice the polymer mass, preventing chain re&#8208;compaction and establishing an interfacial environment that facilitates hydroxyl ion diffusion to ester bonds and depolymerization with minimal alkali consumption. As a result, water&#8208;swollen PET fully depolymerizes (96% TPA yield) at atmospheric pressure within 5&#160;min at 90 &#8728;C$^{\circ }{\rm C}$ or under 2&#160;h at room temperature, vastly outperforming conventional hydrolysis methods. The process achieves a &gt;$&gt;$20&#8208;fold reduction in energy footprint versus direct PET hydrolysis. It performs robustly on challenging, real&#8208;world feedstocks&#8212;including textiles and mixed plastic waste&#8212;enabling selective depolymerization unaffected by PET crystallinity. A techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirms energy efficiency and strong economic feasibility, demonstrating overall competitiveness with existing engineered technologies. Beyond PET, the physical mechanism underpinning the strategy offers a scalable and sustainable platform for recycling a wide range of condensation&#160;polymers.

         <title>Cationic Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Defluorinative Amination of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipyridine&#8208;based Tp&#8208;Bpy COF was transformed into a highly electron&#8208;deficient, cationic Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me COF backbone via one&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification, preserving crystallinity while modulating its electronic structure. The modified COF enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven activation of inert C&#9472;F bonds for efficient C&#9472;N bond formation across diverse substrates&#8212;even under natural sunlight&#8212;highlighting its promise for green heterogeneous photocatalysis.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;a unique class of crystalline, porous materials&#8212;are distinguished for their structural tunability, large surface area, high chemical stability, and tunable functionalities, which can be modified through pre&#8208; or post&#8208;synthetic modifications. These features make COFs highly attractive platforms for heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Building on these inherent advantages, we strategically modulated the electronic structure of a bipyridine&#8208;based COF (Tp&#8208;Bpy) via simple one&#8208;step methylation to yield a dicationic, highly electron&#8208;deficient framework (Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me). This post&#8208;synthetic modification preserved the structural integrity of COF and introduced profound changes to its electronic environment, including a notable upward (positive) shift in the valence band position. Consequently, the cationic Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me COF exhibited an exceptional ability to activate one of the most inert bonds in organic chemistry, the C&#9472;F bond, under visible light irradiation. This study establishes Tp&#8208;Bpy&#8208;Me as a robust and efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for defluorinative C&#9472;N bond formation across a broad range of substrates, including various fluoroarenes and nucleophiles. Remarkably, the photocatalytic transformation proceeds even under natural sunlight, highlighting its potential for sustainable, energy&#8208;efficient applications. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of C&#9472;F bond activation toward C&#9472;N bond formation using a COF&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>Crystal Facet Engineering of BiOCl Fillers in Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiOCl nanosheets with exposed {001} and {010} facets (BOC&#8208;001 and BOC&#8208;010) demonstrate pronounced crystal facet effect when employed as fillers in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). BOC&#8208;010 demonstrates a superior ability to promote the dissociation of LiTFSI and facilitates more efficient Li+ migration at its surface, in comparison with BOC&#8208;001. Consequently, the CSPE with BOC&#8208;010 delivers significantly enhanced Li+ conductivity and a higher Li+ transference number. This study first unveils the crystal facet effect of filler in SPEs and offers a promising strategy to enhance SPEs performance.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their high flexibility and good interfacial contact with electrodes. Incorporating appropriate inorganic fillers into the polymer matrix is a normal and effective method to improve its performance. Despite extensive research on novel fillers, the role of filler crystal facets in SPEs remains unexplored. In this work, BiOCl nanosheets with exposed {001} and {010} facets (BOC&#8208;001 and BOC&#8208;010) are selectively applied as fillers to form composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPE&#8208;BOC). Both calculations and experimental measurements reveal that filler of BOC&#8208;010 promote the dissociation of LiTFSI more effectively and facilitate faster Li+ migration on its surface, compared to BOC&#8208;001. As a result, CSPE&#8208;10BOC&#8208;010 exhibits an enhanced Li+ ionic conductivity (0.83&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 at 60 &#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.38). The Li symmetric cells with the CSPE&#8208;BOC&#8208;010 exhibit an ultra&#8208;long lifespan, with more than 2,000 hours of stable cycling at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Li/CSPE&#8208;10BOC&#8208;010/LFP battery also has an excellent cycling performance at 60&#160;&#176;C, retaining140&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;C after 390 cycles. This work deepens the understanding of the crystal plane characteristics of fillers in SPEs and offers a novel, promising strategy to enhance SPE performance.

         <title>Surface Vacancy Engineering Re&#8208;Routes First&#8208;Cycle Redox for Stabilized Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical treatment creates anionic/cationic vacancies and atomic displacements. During the first cycle charge, these vacancies triggered early reversible O oxidation, at the expense of suppressed Ni oxidation, preventing brutal lattice collapse. This prevented further Mn dissolution during discharge and improved Coulombic efficiency (CE). By re&#8208;routing the first&#8208;cycle redox process, the long&#8208;term cycle was improved with stabilized Ni and O redox over 50 cycles. 








Abstract
We demonstrate that atomic&#8208;scale surface disorder can control the first&#8208;cycle redox sequence of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides, eliminating the detrimental process of oxygen release and lattice collapse that degrades performance. In Li1.14Ni0.32Mn0.54O2 (LNMO), a simple chemical treatment introduces oxygen and transition metal (TM) vacancies confined to the particle surface while preserving the bulk layered framework. Multi&#8208;modal synchrotron analyses reveal that these vacancies trigger an early oxygen oxidation below 4.4&#8201;V, delay nickel oxidation to higher potential, and suppress the formation of covalent Ni4+&#9472;O states. This modified pathway prevents irreversible oxygen release, suppresses manganese dissolution, and maintains metal&#8208;oxygen coordination at high voltages. Consequently, the treated cathode delivers higher first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE), mitigated voltage fade, and superior capacity retention. By directly linking engineered surface disorder to redox reactions and associated structural transformations, this work establishes a general design principle for durable, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

During the first cycle charge, these vacancies triggered early reversible O oxidation, at the expense of suppressed Ni oxidation, preventing brutal lattice collapse. This prevented further Mn dissolution during discharge and improved Coulombic efficiency (CE). By re-routing the first-cycle redox process, the long-term cycle was improved with stabilized Ni and O redox over 50 cycles. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that atomic-scale surface disorder can control the &lt;i&gt;first-cycle redox sequence&lt;/i&gt; of Li-rich layered oxides, eliminating the detrimental process of oxygen release and lattice collapse that degrades performance. In Li&lt;sub&gt;1.14&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.54&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LNMO), a simple chemical treatment introduces oxygen and transition metal (TM) vacancies confined to the particle surface while preserving the bulk layered framework. Multi-modal synchrotron analyses reveal that these vacancies trigger an early oxygen oxidation below 4.4&#8201;V, delay nickel oxidation to higher potential, and suppress the formation of covalent Ni&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O states. This modified pathway prevents irreversible oxygen release, suppresses manganese dissolution, and maintains metal-oxygen coordination at high voltages. Consequently, the treated cathode delivers higher first-cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE), mitigated voltage fade, and superior capacity retention. By directly linking engineered surface disorder to redox reactions and associated structural transformations, this work establishes a general design principle for durable, high-energy-density cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Picosecond Stabilization of Transferred Charge Carriers at Plasmonic Metal&#8211;Molecule Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge and heat transfer processes between plasmonic nanoparticles and adsorbed moleculal monolayers are observed using ultrafast infrared spectrocopy. Analysis of free carrier absorption and vibrational signals indicates that overflowing charge carriers are stabilized, extending their lifetime to several picoseconds. Both the charge and heat transfer properties vary significantly depending on the type of adsorbed molecules.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles efficiently absorb light across a broad spectral range, enabling energy transfer to adjacent molecules or semiconductors for photocatalytic applications. However, the nature and timescale of charge carrier involvement in these transfer processes remain a subject of ongoing debate. In this study, we employ broad&#8208;band femtosecond time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy (1100&#8211;3000&#160;cm&#8722;1) as a sensitive probe of free charge carriers to investigate charge transfer dynamics in selected molecules adsorbed on silver nanoparticles. Charge transfer is observed exclusively under resonant excitation of the plasmon and in the presence of adsorbed molecules. Notably, the dynamics of the resulting infrared absorption vary significantly with probe frequency and molecular identity. By applying both Drude and Polaron models, we present compelling evidence that the transferred charge carriers undergo stabilization through solvation and polaron formation. As a consequence, the molecule&#8208;specific time constants for charge back&#8208;transfer extend well beyond the commonly assumed sub&#8208;picosecond regime, indicating a more complex relaxation landscape. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of light&#8208;induced changes in molecular IR modes closely parallels that of the free carrier signal, reinforcing the presence of strong charge carrier&#8211;adsorbate interactions.

         <title>Pseudohalide&#8208;Guided Redox Control Enables Electrochemical Auto&#8208;Tandem Nickel Catalysis for Butafulvene Synthesis.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a conceptually novel electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed transformation that enables the direct conversion of propargyl carbonates into butafulvenes through a tandem reductive coupling&#8208;oxidative cyclization sequence. Mechanistic studies reveal that pseudohalide ligands guide the redox state of nickel, enabling selective Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalysis under electroreductive conditions.








Abstract
Electrochemical nickel catalysis offers a unique platform for redox&#8208;controlled reactivity, yet its application to tandem catalysis remains underexplored. We report the development, mechanistic elucidation, and synthetic application of a conceptually novel electrochemical strategy that enables auto&#8208;tandem nickel&#8208;catalyzed (e&#8208;ATC) conversion of propargyl carbonates into butafulvenes, highly strained, antiaromatic scaffolds with limited synthetic accessibility. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations reveal that this transformation merges a reductive coupling with a mechanistically distinct cycloisomerization, both mediated by a single nickel catalyst under electroreductive conditions. Crucially, pseudohalide ligands play a central role in steering a controlled Ni(0)/Ni(II) redox manifold by suppressing one&#8208;electron Ni(I) pathways, thereby favoring a polar two&#8208;electron mechanism. The method enables broad access to butafulvenes, including fused&#8208;ring variants that are inaccessible by previous catalytic routes. Further derivatizations demonstrate the synthetic utility of these butafulvenes as precursors to strained dendralenes and complex polycyclic frameworks.

         <title>Modular Access to sp3&#8208;Rich Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Bioisosteres via Energy&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Carbene Insertion</title>

We report an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;enabled strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted BCPs via strain&#8208;release triplet carbene addition to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). Key advantages include the modular installation of versatile bridge ester substituents, enabling downstream diversification, while retaining the bridgehead substituents from the BCB precursor. Experimental and DFT studies support a mechanism involving photoinduced energy transfer to generate a triplet carbene, followed by addition across the highly strained C&#9472;C &#963; bond of the BCB framework.








Abstract
Substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are increasingly recognized as valuable sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres for ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;disubstituted benzene rings, offering improved pharmacokinetic properties and broad utility in drug discovery. Herein, we report an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;enabled strategy for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted BCPs via strain&#8208;release triplet carbene addition to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). This method employs readily accessible diazoacetates and a diverse set of BCBs under mild blue&#8208;light irradiation, providing direct access to 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCPs. Key advantages include the modular installation of versatile bridge ester substituents, enabling downstream diversification, while retaining the bridgehead substituents from the BCB precursor. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated through the preparation of BCP analogues of bioactive fragments. Combined experimental and DFT studies support a mechanism involving photoinduced energy transfer to generate a triplet carbene, followed by stepwise addition across the highly strained C&#9472;C &#963; bond of the BCB framework.

         <title>Spirosilanes Activate Gold(I)&#8208;Catalysts in Cycloisomerization and Intermolecular Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

Spirosilanes activate LAuCl complexes to promote catalysis. This silver&#8208;free activation through weak interactions is nondestructive so that low loadings of LAuCl are possible as well as their recycling. It can also be beneficial for asymmetric catalysis. 








Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions have established as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering efficient pathways to construct diverse molecular structures and notably scaffolds with high complexity. Most processes rely on the use of LAuCl precatalysts, which are generally activated, i.e., cationized, by silver salts. In this work, we explore the role of silicon&#8208;based Lewis acids based, such as spirosilane, derivatives as alternative activators in lieu of silver salts. It was found that Martin spirosilanes mediate the activation of gold precatalysts, facilitating diverse cyclization and cycloisomerization reactions as well as intermolecular reactions. NMR studies and computational investigations suggest that no real cationization, i.e., formation of an ionic pair, takes place, but rather activation through weak interaction between silicon and the chlorine atom of LAuCl. This preserves the Au&#9472;Cl bond and ultimately enables the LAuCl complex to be recovered. On the same line, the LAuCl&#8211;silane interaction has also proven to be beneficial for asymmetric catalysis. This work significantly contributes to the expansion of gold&#8208;catalyzed transformations by opening up the prospect of a more sustainable gold catalysis. It also opens perspectives on the use of silicon&#8208;based Lewis acids as versatile cooperative agents in organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Using Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Orthogonally&#8208;Reactive Dispersants to Design Tough Nanostructured Materials: Application to Epoxy Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be efficiently performed in orthogonally reactive dispersants such as epoxides (DGEBA or ECC) to generate a range of reactive block copolymer dispersions displaying different morphologies. Subsequent polymerization of the epoxide dispersant (through epoxy&#8208;amine reaction or cationic photopolymerization) affords the preparation of (nano)structured epoxy networks with enhanced toughness.








Abstract
We report here how the polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approach can be implemented in orthogonally reactive dispersants to afford the preparation of nanostructured polymer networks. Precisely&#8208;defined PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PLMA block copolymers self&#8208;assembling into different morphologies are first obtained in epoxy monomers through RAFT dispersion polymerization. The subsequent polymerization of the epoxide (through step growth or chain growth polymerization) affords the straightforward preparation of epoxy networks that integrate diverse BCP structures and exhibit significantly enhanced fracture toughness at extremely low block copolymer content (1%&#160;w/w).

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Induced Morphological Transitions for On&#8208;Demand Detachment in Worm&#8208;Based Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a temperature&#8208;responsive adhesive hydrogel via polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), where adhesion strength is modulated by temperature&#8208;driven morphological transitions resulting core block hydrophilicity change. This system enables detachment at both high and low temperatures&#8212;particularly on complex surfaces&#8212;while enhancing the hydrogel's reusability and recyclability.








Abstract
Temperature&#8208;responsive materials are vital for applications relating to on&#8208;demand detachable adhesives, as they enable rapid, damage&#8208;free detachment. However, low&#8208;temperature responsive systems often lack pronounced phase change, which can lead to undesirable mechanical interlocking with complicated substrate interfaces. Polymerisation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has been effectively employed to fabricate worm&#8208;like hydrogels exhibiting temperature&#8208;induced phase transitions; however, its application in on&#8208;demand detachment remains underexplored. Building on this, we leverage precise morphological tuning across a broad temperature range (1 to 70&#160;&#176;C) to modulate the hydrogel phase. Our hydrogel exhibits a reversible transition from a robust adhesive state at room temperature to a non&#8208;adhesive liquid phase upon both cooling and heating. This approach overcomes the limitations associated with low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature responsive detachment on complex surfaces, thereby broadening its utility.

         <title>Generality&#8208;Driven Optimization of Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Mono&#8208;Reduction of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyls by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Machine Learning</title>

A multi&#8208;substrate high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) strategy enables the general asymmetric mono&#8208;reduction of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyls using chiral oxazaborolidinium ion (COBI) catalysts. Simultaneous quantitative 1H and 19F NMR analyses integrated with machine learning (ML) deliver enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones in excellent yields and selectivities, providing rapid access to valuable chiral building blocks.








Abstract
The longstanding quest for substrate generality stems from the unpredictability of single&#8208;model optimization. Leveraging high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), we present a practical multi&#8208;substrate screening strategy for the general asymmetric mono&#8208;reduction of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyls. Quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy combined with simultaneous chiral analysis by 19F NMR for pooled crude mixtures accelerated the workflow eightfold. Robust screening of 31 chiral oxazaborolidinium ion (COBI) variants across eight substrates tackled even ethyl/methyl differentiation. HTE data were utilized in a machine learning (ML) model with CGR (Condensed Graphs of Reaction)&#8208;based descriptors, identifying catalysts for target substrates without quantum chemical calculations. The ARMS (Automated Reaction Mapping for various Substituents) system was introduced to streamline SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) preprocessing for multi&#8208;substrate datasets. The resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones, obtained in excellent yields (up to&#160;&gt;99%) and selectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99% ee, &gt;20:1 r.r.), could be readily transformed into high&#8208;value compounds, such as (S)&#8208;bupropion.

         <title>Square&#8208;Planar Ruthenium Alkylidyne Complexes Undergo Stepwise Rather Than Concerted [2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloadditions with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
After decades of research into metal alkylidyne complexes and their extensive use as catalysts for alkyne metathesis, one might think that there is nothing fundamentally new to be discovered in this field. The present study into formally d4&#8208;configured Ru alkylidynes shows that this notion is incorrect: not only is a novel and convenient entry route disclosed but also an entirely unprecedented stepwise pathway for [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions is uncovered.








Abstract
A new entry into square&#8208;planar, formally d4&#8208;configured ruthenium alkylidyne complexes is disclosed, using p&#8208;tolyl(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane as a convenient and safe alkylidyne synthon. The method furnished complex 12 supported by an electron&#8208;rich PNP&#8208;pincer ligand, which undergoes remarkably facile [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and strained alkynes; these reactions represent the first examples of metallacyclobutadiene formation by a d4&#8208;configured transition metal alkylidyne complex. Strikingly, however, the cycloadditions proceed by a stepwise mechanism, which stands in marked contrast to the concerted pathway entertained by all prototypical d0 and d2 Schrock&#8208;type alkylidynes, including the molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium complexes that currently dominate the field of alkyne metathesis. In essence, it is the non&#8208;bonding lone pair forming the largely metal&#8208;centered HOMO of significant dz2 character that accounts for this unorthodox behavior. The newly gained insight into this key reactivity determinant also allows the few other known reactions of formally d4&#8208;configured alkylidene complexes previously described in the literature to be explained and will empower further explorations of their chemistry.

         <title>Bright and Color&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Excimer Emission from Pre&#8208;Organized, Naphthalene Diimide Molecular Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents color&#8208;tunable and efficient excimer circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from arylenediimides through core&#8208;substitution. The study highlights pre&#8208;organized chiral bischromophoric designs, which produce some of the brightest green and red CPL emitters among purely organic systems, exhibiting solution&#8208;state dissymmetry factors in the order of&#160;10&#8722;2.








Abstract
Within the realm of organic materials, excimer emission has emerged as an efficient strategy for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active systems, owing to its intrinsic combination of high brightness and large dissymmetry factors (glum). Nevertheless, progress with this approach has been constrained by limited color tunability and substrate scope, with red&#8208;emissive circularly polarized excimer emission remaining essentially unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that core&#8208;substitution chemistry of naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives offers a versatile platform to achieve tunable excimeric CPL spanning the visible range, from 500&#160;nm (green) to 650&#160;nm (red), reported here for the first time. By employing cyclophane and clip&#8208;like pre&#8208;organized molecular architectures, excited&#8208;state chirality was effectively introduced, affording bright circularly polarized excimer emission with impressively high glum values of up to 4.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (green) and 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 (red), along with remarkable CPL brightness. These results, combining outstanding brightness with the rare realization of red&#8208;emissive excimeric CPL, place these systems among the highest&#8208;performing small molecule CPL emitters to date.

The study highlights pre-organized chiral bischromophoric designs, which produce some of the brightest green and red CPL emitters among purely organic systems, exhibiting solution-state dissymmetry factors in the order of&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the realm of organic materials, excimer emission has emerged as an efficient strategy for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)-active systems, owing to its intrinsic combination of high brightness and large dissymmetry factors (g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;). Nevertheless, progress with this approach has been constrained by limited color tunability and substrate scope, with red-emissive circularly polarized excimer emission remaining essentially unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that core-substitution chemistry of naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives offers a versatile platform to achieve tunable excimeric CPL spanning the visible range, from 500&#160;nm (green) to 650&#160;nm (red), reported here for the first time. By employing cyclophane and clip-like pre-organized molecular architectures, excited-state chirality was effectively introduced, affording bright circularly polarized excimer emission with impressively high g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values of up to 4.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (green) and 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (red), along with remarkable CPL brightness. These results, combining outstanding brightness with the rare realization of red-emissive excimeric CPL, place these systems among the highest-performing small molecule CPL emitters to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical, Template&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Two Different Organometallic Capsules from a Tetrakisimidazolium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dodecasilver capsules were synthesized from tetra&#8208;NHC&#8208;decorated calix[4]resorcinarene ligands and Ag2O through hierarchical template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly utilizing {Ag(NCCH3)4(BF4)8}7&#8722; or (CF3SO3)88&#8722; templates. The dodecanuclear assemblies represent the largest organometallic capsules obtained to date from poly&#8208;NHC ligands.








Abstract
Controlling the assembly of molecular nanocapsules through metal&#8208;carbon bonds constitutes a major challenge in the field of supramolecular organometallic chemistry. Here, we demonstrate the construction of two nanosized dodecanuclear organometallic capsules, [{Ag(CH3CN)4(BF4)8}&#8834;Ag12(1)6](BF4)5 and [(CF3SO3)8&#8834;Ag12(1)6](CF3SO3)4 from the calix[4]resorcinarene&#8208;based tetrakisimidazolium salts H4&#8208;1(X)4 and AgI ions employing the metal&#8208;carbene directed self&#8208;assembly and hierarchical template strategies. An [Ag(CH3CH)4(BF4)8]7&#8722; anion or eight triflate anions served as templates. The dodecanuclear capsules are the largest poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;derived assemblies known so far. Salt H4&#8208;1(SbF6)4 reacts with Ag2O to give the tetranuclear assembly [(SbF6)&#8834;Ag4(1)2](SbF6)3 featuring an encapsulated SbF6&#8722; anion. Transmetalation of the tetra&#8208;NHC ligands from silver to gold yielded in all cases tetranuclear assemblies of type [Au4(1)2]X4.

         <title>Transient&#8208;Promoter&#8208;Stabilized NiFe Oxyhydroxide Enables Durable kW&#8208;Scale Water Splitting Under Fluctuating Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient&#8208;promoter strategy facilitates the formation, stabilization, and porosity of NiFe oxyhydroxide from its precursor Ni3Fe1.2Cr0.8Ox for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Direct integration with fluctuating power in a kilowatt&#8208;scale 512 cm2 anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) achieves 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.78&#160;V per cell at 60 &#176;C, highlighting a scalable non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal pathway to durable green hydrogen production.








Abstract
Renewable&#8208;powered water electrolysis provides a carbon&#8208;neutral route to hydrogen, yet large&#8208;scale deployment is constrained by reliance on stable but carbon&#8208;intensive grid electricity. Direct integration with fluctuating renewable power requires catalysts and devices that can endure dynamic operating conditions. Here we present a transient&#8208;promoter strategy for NiFe oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, realized from Ni3Fe1.2Cr0.8Ox precursor, for kilowatt&#8208;scale anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Ex situ and operando spectroscopy establish that Cr (i) modulates Ni/Fe oxidation states to enrich positive charge and facilitate oxyhydroxide formation, (ii) induces porosity that enhances electrolyte penetration and OH&#8722; adsorption, and (iii) leaches sacrificially to protect Ni/Fe active sites. Lab&#8208;scale AEMWE device achieves an industrially relevant current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.68&#160;V and sustains continuous operation for over 30 days under both constant and fluctuating loads. Scaling from 1 cm2 AEMWE to an 8&#8208;cell, 512 cm2 stack, the system can handle an electrical power of 2.5&#160;kW at peak, and delivers 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.78&#160;V per cell at 60 &#176;C. The stack remains resilient over 13 simulated solar cycles (&gt;50&#160;h), underscoring the feasibility of integrating renewable electricity with durable, NiFe oxyhydroxide OER catalyst based AEMWEs.

A selective arylation of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds in amides and alcohols has been achieved using photo&#8208;induced divalent palladium catalysis at room temperature. This current approach enables C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling utilizing aryl iodides as both hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and arylating agents, effectively bypassing the common &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and annulation pathways.








Abstract
Catalytic modification of C&#8722;H bonds using palladium is highly appealing, but transformations involving alkyl&#8208;Pd(II) intermediates with &#946;&#8208;hydrogens are challenging due to the propensity for &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. To address this, selective arylation of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds in amides and alcohols has been achieved using divalent palladium as an excited&#8208;state transition metal (TM) species at room temperature. Our approach unveils a non&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral pathway to achieve C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings, utilizing aryl iodides as both hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and arylating agents for the first time under Pd&#8208;photochemical conditions. The mechanism involves photo&#8208;induced Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed aryl radical generation, HAT, and aryl migration, effectively bypassing the common &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and annulation pathways. Mechanistic investigations using isotope&#8208;labeled compounds and density functional theory (DFT) studies support the mechanistic rationale, affirming both the feasibility and intricacies of this effective transformation.

         <title>Fully Aromatic Fluorinated Polyamide Nanofilms with Molecular Gating for Ultrafast Crude Oil Fractionation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully aromatic fluorinated polyamide (FAFPA) nanofilms feature a switchable molecular gating&#8208;on/gating&#8208;off state to activate and reconstruct sub&#8208;nanochannels for the permselectivity of hydrocarbon liquids, enabling ultrafast and stable crude oil fractionation. The gating&#8208;on FAFPA nanofilms show an unprecedented separation factor for 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene of about 33 and toluene permeance of over 2&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which surpasses the permselectivity of most reported membranes.








Abstract
Crude oil is the &#8220;black gold&#8221; of the world and its fractionation by thermal distillation is a highly energy&#8208;consuming process. Polymer membranes are manifesting the potential in revolutionizing crude oil fractionation for developing energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;footprint petrochemical engineering. Nevertheless, conventional polymer membranes suffer from inferior fractionation performance with unsatisfied permeance and selectivity owing to their polar channel chemistry as well as low&#8208;connective and vulnerable channel architecture. We report a kind of robust, fully aromatic fluorinated polyamide (FAFPA) nanofilm that features a switchable molecular gating&#8208;on/gating&#8208;off state to activate and reconstruct sub&#8208;nanochannels for the permselectivity of hydrocarbon liquids, enabling ultrafast and stable crude oil fractionation. We demonstrate the gating&#8208;on state is launched by the interplay of FAFPA networks and polar&#8208;matched trigger molecules bearing &#945;&#8208;H such as alcohols and ketones, redefining the sub&#8208;nanochannel chemistry and improving the spatial connectivity of sub&#8208;nanochannels to accelerate the selective transport of hydrocarbons. The gating&#8208;on FAFPA nanofilms show a record&#8208;high separation factor of 33 for 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene with a molecular weight of 204&#160;Da as well as a profound n&#8208;hexane permeance, 24&#8208;fold higher than that of the gating&#8208;off state. Moreover, these gating&#8208;on FAFPA nanofilms can stably handle typical black crude oil at an elevated temperature of 80 &#176;C for garnering a 32&#8208;fold increased permeance while sustaining nearly constant selectivity toward hydrocarbons.

         <title>Electrochemical pH&#8208;Swing CO2 Capture Facilitated by Suppressed Bubble Accumulation at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas bubbles at the electrode/electrolyte interface strongly impact electrochemical pH&#8208;swing CO2 capture by hindering CO2 diffusion into the high&#8208;alkalinity region near the cathode surface. Based on this finding, a polymer&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based reactor was designed by leveraging the cationic effect to suppress bubble accumulation induced by H2 evolution, achieving a threefold improvement in carbon capture rate in direct air capture.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 capture features high modularity and low system complexity. When the pH swing produced by electrolysis reactions acts as the driving force of CO2 capture, the entire process is further endowed with enhanced tolerance to poisoning. Nevertheless, the correlation between the type of electrolysis reaction and electrochemical CO2 capture efficiency remains poorly understood, rendering the reactor inefficient. Here, we show that the behavior of gas bubbles exerts a strong influence on CO2 capture rates and Faradaic efficiencies. We demonstrate that eliminating bubble accumulation by suppressing H2 evolution at the cathode/electrolyte interface facilitates CO2 capture, which ensures the access of CO2 to the alkaline electrode surfaces. We devise a polymer&#8208;electrolyte CO2 capture reactor utilizing oxygen reduction as the driving force and the cation effect to reduce the activity of H2 formation. The system offers a capture rate of 1.40&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 mLCO2 min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 220&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.9% and poisoning resistance to O2 and impurities in simulated flue gases. In direct air capture (DAC) mode, the reactor achieves a capture rate of about 0.029&#160;mLCO2 min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a stable 200&#8208;h operation at approximately 0.019 mLCO2 min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and 0.95&#160;V, outperforming existing electrochemical DAC devices.

         <title>Distinctive Coordination Configuration and Interfacial Water Balance Induced by Anti&#8208;Kirkendall Effect Attain Exceptional Catalytic Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of acid&#8208;etched PtFeCoNi catalysts (PtFeCoNi&#8208;N) are successfully designed with unconventionally hindered Ni outward migration in the presence of Fe and Co. Compared to acid&#8208;etched PtNi jagged nanowires with Ni outward migration, more Ni is located in the interior/center of pod&#8208;like PtFeCoNi&#8208;N nanowire based on the anti&#8208;Kirkendall effect, which facilitates EOR catalysis and promotes the C1 pathway to produce CO2 due to electronic effect induced by more core and subsurface Ni.








Abstract
A critical challenge for the application of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) lies in the sluggish kinetics of C&#9472;C cleavage. Herein, a significant portion of Ni is retained in the interior of nitric acid etched PtFeCoNi pod&#8208;like nanowires (PtFeCoNi&#8208;N) with incomplete voids/cavities due to anti&#8208;Kirkendall effect. The efficient electronic tuning toward surface Pt gives rise to the superior ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) activity of 1.82 A mgPt&#8722;1 and 3.21&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 4.80&#8208;fold and 5.10&#8208;fold improved relative to Pt/C, respectively. Strikingly, after chronoamperometric test of 50&#160;000&#160;s and 1500 consecutive potential cycles, 86.81% and 82.42% of the initial activity of PtFeCoNi&#8208;N are retained. Multiple spectroscopic characterizations reveal that the PtFeCoNi&#8208;N shows excellent selectivity toward C1 pathway even above 1.0&#160;V. The lowered Pt coordination related to less occupancy of antibonding states plays a crucial role for enhancement in activity and selectivity. The interfacial microenvironment balance between hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O and free H2O contributes to H2O dissociation for CO* oxidation. Density functional theory elucidates the origin of anti&#8208;Kirkendall effect and the intimate electronic interaction with surface Pt that endows PtFeCoNi&#8208;N with superior inclination toward C1 pathway. This work presents a novel catalyst design strategy of reversing the dissolution of transition metals.

         <title>A Cathepsin B&#8208;Triggered CO&#8208;Releasing Molecule with a Non&#8208;Toxic Metal Core for Targeted Tumor Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;based, enzyme&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM) is site&#8208;specifically conjugated to the antibody trastuzumab. This novel ET&#8208;CORM&#8208;antibody conjugate releases carbon monoxide upon cleavage by the tumor&#8208;associated protease cathepsin B. The construct enables selective intracellular CO delivery to HER2&#8208;overexpressing and CatB&#8208;expressing cells, presenting a new strategy for targeted, CO&#8208;based cancer therapies.








Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) has shown therapeutic potential across various diseases, including cancer. To enable controlled delivery, many CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed. However, their clinical translation has been limited due to concerns about stability, potential toxicity, and insufficient targeting ability. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of an enzyme&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM) that can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to antibodies. This novel ET&#8208;CORM is built on a biocompatible iron core, and releases CO upon cleavage by the cancer&#8208;associated protease cathepsin B (CatB). The incorporation of a bioorthogonal handle into ET&#8208;CORM enabled its efficient and site&#8208;specific conjugation to the clinically used antibody trastuzumab via the interchain disulfide bonds. The resulting ET&#8208;CORM&#8211;antibody conjugate (ET&#8208;CORM&#8208;Ab) exhibited an average drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) of 6.8, corresponding to approximately 20 CO molecules per conjugate. This construct allowed for selective intracellular CO delivery to HER2&#8208;overexpressing and CatB&#8208;expressing cells in vitro. This study represents a metal&#8208;based CORM&#8211;antibody conjugate activated by a tumor&#8208;associated enzymatic trigger, opening new avenues for investigating CO&#8208;mediated effects and advancing CO&#8208;based cancer therapies to the clinics.

         <title>Natural Resin Nanofilms through Flexible Coordination for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically robust natural resin nanofilms engineered through flexible coordination between rosin ligands and metal ions at interface enable durable and efficient molecular separation.








Abstract
Forestry biomass, with its diverse functionalities and abundant resources, holds great potential for the sustainable development of thin&#8208;film technologies. However, high brittleness arising from the rigid structural units of most forestry biomass materials significantly hinders thin&#8208;film processing. We demonstrate the transformation of rosin, a typical brittle forestry resin, into mechanically robust nanofilms with flexible chemical linkages. Carboxylic rosin derivatives solubilized in turpentine, a natural oleoresin solvent, were chemically assembled into nanofilms via interfacial coordination with aqueous metal ions. Tunable metal&#8208;rosin coordination enables precise structural modulation of nanofilms to achieve exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus&gt;120&#160;GPa) while its dynamic nature renders nanofilms high elasticity for pliable integration. The resulting nanofilm composite membranes exhibit durable and efficient molecular sieving during nanofiltration, with pressure resistance up to 20&#160;bar and superior permselectivity. As an emerging form of natural resin, these nanofilms may revolutionize the paradigm of biomass&#8208;based thin films by overcoming brittleness through flexibility.

         <title>Anionic Hofmeister Effect Differentiated Subcellular Distributions of pH&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Organic Cages for Tumor Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of an anionic Hofmeister effect triggered subcellular distributions of pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic cage for precision tumor therapy was developed, where BF4&#8722;&#8208;coordinated cages exhibit preferential cell membrane anchoring, while their Cl&#8722;&#8208;incorporated counterparts demonstrate more endocytosis for lysosome targeting and pH&#8208;activated photodynamic immunotherapy.








Abstract
The precise control of subcellular distribution offers significant advantages for advancing the understanding of cellular biology and targeted theranostics strategies. Herein, we report anionic Hofmeister effect triggered allostery of pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic cage MOC&#8208;68, which regulates the subcellular distributions with the salting&#8208;out MOC&#8208;68&#8208;BF4 exhibiting preferential cell membrane anchoring, while the salting&#8208;in MOC&#8208;68&#8208;Cl demonstrating more endocytosis for lysosome targeting. Owing to the integration of multi&#8208;functionalities of protonating imidazole moieties, conformationally adaptive amine vertices, and microsecond luminescent lifetimes into a nanocage, these MOCs show pH&#8208;responsive singlet oxygen (1O2) generation through energy transfer pathways, and achieve microenvironment&#8208;programmed photodynamic precision by anchoring MOC&#8208;68&#8208;BF4 to near&#8208;neutral cell membranes whereas enriching MOC&#8208;68&#8208;Cl in acidic lysosomes, which drives spatially resolved 1O2 generation gradients via protonation&#8208;optimized metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer. Moreover, MOC&#8208;68&#8208;Cl achieves superior photocytotoxicity through PANoptosis&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death, driving primary tumor ablation via localized 1O2 burst while systemically activating T cell&#8208;dependent adaptive immunity to concurrently suppress tumor progression and inhibit lung metastasis. This work highlights the potential of anion&#8208;mediated biological behaviors of MOCs, providing a way to advance nanocage biomedicine for future precision theranostic applications.

         <title>Amide and Thioester Synthesis Via Oxidative Coupling of Alcohols with Amines or Thiols Using Alcohol Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are best known for reducing ketones to chiral alcohols, but their oxidative potential is rarely exploited. Here, we show that selected ADHs catalyze newly discovered promiscuous transformations: the oxidative coupling of primary alcohols with amines or thiols, enabling the direct and efficient synthesis of a broad range of amides and thioesters under mild reaction conditions.








Abstract
Amide and thioester moieties are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and functional materials, but their chemical synthesis suffers from poor atom economy and ungreen conditions, while biocatalytic methods require ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes, activated intermediates, or show limited scope and activity. Here, we report the oxidative coupling of alcohols with ammonia or amines catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) via hemiaminal intermediates to form primary and secondary amides at pH 9.5&#8211;10.5. Pf&#8208;ADH preferably converted linear aliphatic or arylaliphatic alcohols (up to 90% conversion), while Pp&#8208;ADH and Aa&#8208;ADH preferably converted branched or aromatic alcohols (up to 99% conversion). Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of an N&#8208;methyl amide gave&#160;&gt;99% conversion and 87% isolated yield. The method was extended to thioacid and thioester formation via hemithioacetal intermediates using hydrogen sulfide or thiols at pH 7. Pf&#8208;ADH favored linear aliphatic alcohols (up to 93% conversion), Pp&#8208;ADH branched alcohols (up to 82% conversion), and Aa&#8208;ADH aromatic alcohols (up to 98% conversion). A KPi/MTBE biphasic system enabled the reaction with poorly soluble long&#8208;chain thiols. Structure&#8208;guided engineering of Aa&#8208;ADH led to the Y151A and L186A variants with expanded activity toward longer&#8208;chain amines or thiols. This work highlights how enzyme promiscuity with protein engineering can enable new&#8208;to&#8208;nature synthetic pathways for the production of valuable compounds.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Matching Effect Triggering Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic and Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the relationship between spin&#8208;state modulation strategy of low&#8208;Pt&#8208;based catalyst and pH&#8208;dependent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways can effectively alleviate oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates site&#8208;blocking effect, enhance ORR activity in acidic/alkaline conditions and further promote ORR kinetics in practical energy&#8208;storage/conversion devices.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts operable across broad pH ranges is hindered by strong adsorption of hydroxyl intermediates (*OH). This work introduces a conceptually novel strategy of spin&#8208;state modulation via interfacial engineering to regulate platinum nanocrystals anchored on atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C substrates (Pt/FeSA&#8208;NC). Based on density functional theory (DFT) predictions, we construct a spin&#8208;state&#8208;tunable architecture by precisely controlling Pt particle size (2&#8211;8&#160;nm), which induces spin&#8208;matching effects that effectively mitigate *OH over&#8208;binding in pH&#8208;dependent ORR path. Mechanistic studies indicate that the synergy between FeN4&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;support interactions and size&#8208;dependent spin polarization facilitates charge transfer, weakening *OH adsorption and promoting its desorption. In alkaline conditions, &#8764;2&#160;nm Pt nanoclusters with moderate spin density achieve a peak power density of 179&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in Zn&#8208;air batteries with 150 h stability. Under acidic media, &#8764;8&#160;nm Pt nanoparticles with low&#8208;spin configuration deliver a mass activity of 0.65 A mgPt&#8722;1 and a peak power density of 730&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), outperforming commercial Pt/C and retaining 90% activity after 3000 cycles. This finding provides a spin&#8208;engineering paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts with ultralow Pt loading.

         <title>Direct C&#9472;H Lactonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by LMCT Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a photochemical method for oxidative &#947;&#8208;C&#9472;H lactonization of simple carboxylic acid substrates upon LMCT photoactivation. Intriguingly, these conditions suppress the rapid decarboxylation characteristic of oxidized carboxylates, suggesting the intermediacy of metal&#8208;stabilized acyloxy radical instead of the dissociative process typically invoked in LMCT photoactivations.








Abstract
Photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) activation of carboxylic acids has increasingly become recognized as a versatile platform for the development of synthetically useful new reactions. When the metal species is also capable of mediating an oxidative radical coupling process, this approach has been shown to be a powerful strategy for decarboxylative coupling of carboxylate feedstocks with diverse nucleophilic reaction partners. LMCT photoreactions that could engage the acyloxy radical intermediate in other canonical reactions of heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals such as 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) would broaden the scope of possible reactions. The rapid intrinsic rate of decarboxylation, however, presents a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the LMCT&#8208;promoted C&#9472;H lactonization of benzoic and aliphatic carboxylic acids. Mechanistic investigations suggest that under the optimized reaction conditions, the key acyloxy radical intermediate can be stabilized by the metal center, enabling 1,5&#8208;zHAT to outcompete decarboxylation.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Field Coupling Driven in Situ Interfacial Growth of COF&#8208;functionalized Membranes for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;field coupling&#8208;driven in situ interface synthesis is employed to grow stable COF functional materials within commercial membranes, aiming to enhance the performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Meanwhile, this initiative fosters a novel perspective on the universal application of in situ preparation of functionalized separators. 








Abstract
Conventional modification methods for the separator of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries often struggle to realize the functional materials well adhering on and across the substrate. Herein, we employ a scalable top&#8208;down strategy in an oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil system to interfacially polymerize COF nanoparticles across a polyolefin substrate as a self&#8208;standing separator for Li&#9472;S batteries. By providing a suitable environment for the membrane to remain flat during polymerization, COF particles can penetrate from the surface into internal pores, forming a uniform and robust architecture. The resulting COF&#8208;functionalized membrane incorporates abundant &#8208;OH groups that effectively promote Li+ transport and restrict polysulfide shuttling. Benefiting from this synergy, the modified separator achieves high ionic conductivity (0.92 mS cm&#8722;1), an elevated polysulfide diffusion barrier (0.390&#160;versus 0.283&#160;eV), and excellent electrochemical performance, including 678 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. This in situ interface polymerization strategy offers a new path for more comprehensively functionalizing COF&#8208;based membrane to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Triplet Metallovinylidenes of Palladium and Platinum Based on a Chelating P/Diazoalkene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chelating diazoalkenes is presented and their coordination complexes with Pd and Pt are characterized. Irradiation triggers N2 loss and gives access to the first triplet metallovinylidenes spectroscopically characterized utilizing FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. Structural verification is given by in crystallo X&#8208;ray diffraction while computational studies support the unique bonding of the new diradical class.








Abstract
Triplet carbenes featuring a metal adjacent to the carbene center (metallocarbenes; R&#9472;C&#9472;M) are an emerging class of diradicals within the field of reactive intermediates. Here, we report the synthesis of the first spectroscopically characterized triplet metallovinylidenes (R&#9472;C&#8594;M; M&#160;=&#160;Pt, Pd). The synthetic access is based on a rigid P/C chelating diazoalkene ligand and its coordination to Pt and Pd. The C/P chelating ligand geometrically constrains the R&#9472;C&#8594;M angle and inhibits free bending. Irradiation of the free diazoalkene ligand generates a triplet vinylidene, characterized by Q&#8208;band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Irradiation of the metal coordination complexes (Pt and Pd) affords triplet metallovinylidenes, which were characterized at low temperatures including photochemically triggered in crystallo X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements allowed the determination of the large triplet zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) with D values of 124.5&#160;cm&#8722;1 (Pt) and 8.0&#160;cm&#8722;1 (Pd) in excellent agreement with the electronic structure obtained by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Amplification of Birefringence and Nonlinear Optical Response in a Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a coordination&#8208;driven strategy to enhance birefringence and nonlinear optical response in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). By transforming a loosely packed molecular crystal into a 2D CMOF, significant birefringence amplification (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.226) is achieved. First&#8208;principles calculations and measurable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response confirm substantial anisotropy and noncentrosymmetric behavior. These results establish a new approach for designing birefringent and nonlinear optical crystals, with potential applications in ultraviolet photonics and polarization optics.








Abstract
Crystalline materials exhibiting programmable optical anisotropy are of great interest for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging. In this study, we introduce a coordination&#8208;driven approach that significantly enhances optical anisotropy by transforming a loosely packed molecular crystal (crystal&#8208;1) into a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (crystal&#8208;2). This structural transformation leads to a more than 20&#8208;fold increase in birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.226 at 546&#160;nm) and activates a measurable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) activity. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the observed optical enhancement is driven by three main factors: coordination&#8208;driven enhancement of asymmetry, alignment of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, and anisotropic electron distribution. These findings highlight the potential of coordination polymerization as a versatile approach for designing hybrid optical materials with tailored anisotropy, providing a foundation for the development of MOF&#8208;based photonic devices.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholesterol Surfactants into Biofunctional Nanodiscs with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis strategy for cholesterol&#8208;oligo&#8208;glycerol&#8208;based surfactants with tunable nonionic to anionic head groups is reported. The precise control of multivalent surface charges directs self&#8208;assembly and transforms cholesterol vesicles into nanodiscs. Structurally optimized sulfated nanodiscs exhibit significant antiviral activity against HSV&#8208;1. This approach emphasizes the therapeutic potential of charge&#8208;directed supramolecular lipid nanostructures.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of lipid structures derived from amphiphilic molecules plays a crucial role in the development of biomimetic systems. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy for developing cholesteryl&#8208;oligo&#8208;glycerol&#8208;based surfactants with tunable head group functionalities ranging from nonionic to anionic. This approach enables the systematic incorporation of functional groups and thus precise control of surface charge and hydrophilicity. To investigate the influence of multivalent charges on supermolecular&#8208;assembly behavior, we compared three structurally cholesterol (CL) related surfactants: CL&#8208;4S, with four sulfate groups, CL&#8208;1S, with a single sulfate group, and CL&#8208;4OH, a nonionic analog with four hydroxyl groups. We then incorporated these surfactants into lipid bilayers of 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DMPC) and cholesterol (CL) to study their behavior in membrane&#8208;like environments. Experimental, simulation, and theoretical studies demonstrated that the CL&#8208;4S formulation was able to convert lipid vesicles into nanodiscs, unlike CL&#8208;1S and CL&#8208;4OH, demonstrating the importance of adequate charges in supramolecular transition. Furthermore, both 1S&#8208;Vesicles (CL&#8208;1S based sulfated vesicles) and 4S&#8208;Nanodiscs (CL&#8208;4S based sulfated nanodiscs) showed inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 (HSV&#8208;1), indicating the potential of this multivalent supramolecular platform for antiviral applications.

     alt="Charge-Driven Self-Assembly of Cholesterol Surfactants into Biofunctional Nanodiscs with Antiviral Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular synthesis strategy for cholesterol-oligo-glycerol-based surfactants with tunable nonionic to anionic head groups is reported. The precise control of multivalent surface charges directs self-assembly and transforms cholesterol vesicles into nanodiscs. Structurally optimized sulfated nanodiscs exhibit significant antiviral activity against HSV-1. This approach emphasizes the therapeutic potential of charge-directed supramolecular lipid nanostructures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly of lipid structures derived from amphiphilic molecules plays a crucial role in the development of biomimetic systems. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy for developing cholesteryl-oligo-glycerol-based surfactants with tunable head group functionalities ranging from nonionic to anionic. This approach enables the systematic incorporation of functional groups and thus precise control of surface charge and hydrophilicity. To investigate the influence of multivalent charges on supermolecular-assembly behavior, we compared three structurally cholesterol (CL) related surfactants: CL-4S, with four sulfate groups, CL-1S, with a single sulfate group, and CL-4OH, a nonionic analog with four hydroxyl groups. We then incorporated these surfactants into lipid bilayers of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and cholesterol (CL) to study their behavior in membrane-like environments. Experimental, simulation, and theoretical studies demonstrated that the CL-4S formulation was able to convert lipid vesicles into nanodiscs, unlike CL-1S and CL-4OH, demonstrating the importance of adequate charges in supramolecular transition. Furthermore, both 1S-Vesicles (CL-1S based sulfated vesicles) and 4S-Nanodiscs (CL-4S based sulfated nanodiscs) showed inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), indicating the potential of this multivalent supramolecular platform for antiviral applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Theoretical Screening of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrochemical Urea Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput screening accelerates the discovery of efficient MN4C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for urea synthesis. A volcano relationship between *N adsorption and activity is identified, and the *NO3&#160;&#8594;&#160;*N conversion limiting potential emerges as a key descriptor for catalyst evaluation.








Abstract
Electrochemical urea synthesis offers a promising approach for sustainable nitrogen and carbon utilization, yet its progress is hindered by the unclear reaction mechanism and the lack of effective catalyst design principles. Here, we conduct a high&#8208;throughput screening of over 40 MN4C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to identify promising candidates for electrochemical urea synthesis. This strategy improves screening efficiency by 94.8% compared to conventional methods. Our analysis demonstrates that Ti&#9472;, V&#9472;, Nb&#9472;, Mo&#9472;, and Hf&#8211;N4C catalysts concurrently fulfill the essential criteria, including thermodynamic stability, favorable adsorption of small molecules, suppression of competing reactions, and low energy barriers for both hydrogenation and C&#8211;N coupling. Mechanistic investigations reveal two distinct C&#8211;N coupling pathways and demonstrate that hydrogenation of *N species is a prerequisite for subsequent coupling. Notably, we reveal a linear correlation between the limiting potentials of NO3&#8722; reduction and overall urea synthesis, establishing *NO3&#160;&#8594;&#160;*N activity as a reliable descriptor for catalyst screening. This work provides mechanistic insights and a predictive framework for the rational design of efficient urea electrocatalysts.

         <title>Incorporating Redox&#8208;Active Hexaazatrinaphthylene into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

We report the first HATN&#8208;based 2D conductive MOF (HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn), featuring Zn&#8208;bis(dioxolene) linkages that provide dual redox&#8208;active sites, conductivity, and remarkable Na+ storage performance. HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn delivers high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability over 5000 cycles, and robust performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work highlights a rational design strategy for durable, high&#8208;performance MOF anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) hold tremendous promise as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), owing to their electrical conductivity, porosity, appropriate interlayer spacing that facilitates ion intercalation, and stability in organic electrolytes. Yet, creating cMOFs hosting multiple redox&#8208;active sites remains challenging. This paper reports a hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN)&#8208;based 2D cMOF, HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn, assembled by coordinating redox&#8208;inactive Zn2+ through bis(dioxolene) linkages. HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn forms hexagonal rod&#8208;like crystals with electrical conductivity that promote rapid Na+ diffusion and storage. As an anode, this material delivers a high reversible capacity of 319&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and retains a capacity of 86&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, demonstrating outstanding cycling stability at room temperature. Notably, HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn sustains performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, showing an initial capacity of 117&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and 84.4% retention after 200 cycles at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1, underscoring stability under harsh conditions. This stability is attributed to the structural robustness provided by redox&#8208;inactive Zn2+. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that dual redox&#8208;active sites in the HATN moiety and Zn&#8208;bis(dioxolene) linkages facilitate multiple electron transfer. This work highlights the design potential of combining redox&#8208;active ligands with redox&#8208;inactive metal nodes in 2D cMOFs for durable SIB anodes.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Supramolecular Polymerization and Morphology&#8208;Depended Photoconductivity Modulation in a Squaraine&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Squaraine Bulk p/n Heterojunction</title>

         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A&#8211;D molecule with squaraine donor and NDI acceptor linked by an amide linker undergoes supramolecular polymerization forming nanoscale p/n heterojunctions. Depending on solvent polarity, this process yields J&#8208;type crystalline nanoparticle&#8208;like or H&#8211;type amorphous fibrous aggregates, in which the former exhibits approximately twice the photoconductivity of the latter.








Abstract
We designed a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecule, TISQ, consisting of squaraine as the electron donor and naphthalene diimide as the electron acceptor, connected via amide linkages that promote hydrogen bonding. This molecule undergoes self&#8208;assembly with spatial segregation of donor and acceptor moieties depending on the nature of the solvent. In polar solvents, J&#8208;type aggregates are formed via a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation mechanism, whereas in low&#8208;polarity solvents, H&#8208;type aggregates are formed through an isodesmic pathway. Microscopic analyses showed that J&#8208;type aggregates adopt nanoparticle&#8208;like morphologies, whereas H&#8208;type aggregates assemble into higher&#8208;order fibrous structures. Photoconductivity measurements demonstrated that J&#8208;type aggregates exhibit enhanced charge transport relative to H&#8208;type aggregates. The maximum transient photoconductivity (&#966;&#931;&#956;) of the J&#8208;type aggregate thin film reached 6.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, exhibiting a photoconductivity 2.0 times greater than that of the H&#8208;type aggregate thin film (3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Although bulk heterojunction solar cells with photoactive layers of the D&#8211;A&#8211;D molecule face challenges in forming continuous macroscopic p/n heterojunctions, these findings underscore that controlled self&#8208;assembly of D&#8211;A&#8211;D molecules facilitates the formation of nanoscale p/n heterojunctions and the aggregate morphology plays a critical role in the charge transport.

         <title>Defluoroalkylation of Trifluoromethane with Organolithium Reagents: Mechanism and Synthesis of Fluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rare example of the transformation of HCF3 into a fluoroalkene functional group through defluoroalkylation. We rationalise product formation through DFT calculations, scale&#8208;up the synthesis through continuous flow methods, and show that a fluoroalkene reagent derived from HCF3 is a competent nucleophile for the fluoroethenylation of a range of aldehydes.








Abstract
Trifluoromethane (HCF3, HFC&#8208;23) is a byproduct of fluoropolymer production that has limited applications. It is often stored or destroyed at the point of production, but if released into the environment is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 14&#160;600 times that of CO2. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical technologies for upgrading HCF3 typically occur with conservation of the CF3 group. These approaches will come under increased scrutiny as concern over the environmental impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continues to grow. A more sustainable approach involves synthetic transformations that repurpose the atomic content of HCF3 while also destroying the CF3 group. In this paper, we report a rare example of the transformation of HCF3 into a fluoroalkene functional group through defluoroalkylation. We rationalise product formation through DFT calculations, scale&#8208;up the synthesis through continuous flow methods, and show that a fluoroalkene reagent derived from HCF3 is a competent nucleophile for the fluoroethenylation of a range of aldehydes.

         <title>Modulation of Photoluminescence and Solar Thermal Energy Storage in Norbornadiene&#8211;Quadricyclane Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichromophoric donor&#8211;acceptor norbornadiene switches exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, tunable photoisomerisation and fluorescence, and record solar energy storage performance. Ortho&#8208;dimers act as efficient photoswitches, whilst para&#8208;dimers are highly emissive. Solvent choice further tunes quantum yields, and a device efficiency of 2.9% with measurable heat release highlights their potential for MOST. 








Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair is a promising system for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. Multichromophoric systems with two or more photoswitches can offer red&#8208;shifted absorption, higher energy densities, and additional functionality. Here, a series of ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted NBD dimers bearing methoxy, hexoxy (for solubility), and cyano groups were synthesised and evaluated for their MOST properties. Compared to monomers, the dimers display red&#8208;shifted absorption and improved solar spectrum match, with onsets between 448&#8211;488&#160;nm, owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor design and extended conjugation. A key finding is the tunable relationship between molecular structure, photoluminescence and photoisomerisation: para&#8208;dimers exhibit efficient fluorescence, whilst ortho&#8208;dimers are superior photoswitches with quantum yields of isomerisation, &#934;i, up to 63%. Solvent choice further modulates behaviour; &#934;i is higher in acetonitrile, whereas fluorescence is more efficient in toluene. This interplay allows tailoring for specific functions. The best&#8208;performing photoswitches were studied in a liquid&#8208;chip device, achieving a record solar conversion efficiency of 2.9%. Catalytic back&#8208;conversion using cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon and macroscopic heat release experiments at 0.1&#160;M yielded a 5.78&#160;&#176;C temperature increase. This first experimental macroscopic heat release of a dimeric system provides important insights into design challenges and opportunities for advancing multichromophoric systems towards MOST applications.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Matched Symbiotic Noncovalent Sites Facilitated Supramolecular Nanotwists Featuring both P and M Sub&#8208;Helical Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy to fabricate helical nanofibers featuring P and M sub&#8208;domains by symbiotic noncovalent sites. Two symbiotic sites (C&#8801;N, Ar&#9472;Hortho) in terminal cyanophenyl group can synergistically form noncovalent with different sites (C&#8801;N&#8943;Hmeta&#9472;Ar; Ar&#9472;Hortho&#8943;N&#8801;C), respectively facilitating the formation of M&#8208;type and P&#8208;type domains due to their opposite spatial direction. Moreover, these helical domains further cooperatively organize into higher&#8208;order P&#8208;nanofibers, providing a novel helical structure that can feature P and M sub&#8208;domains.








Abstract
Living system can use homochiral blocks to simultaneously fabricate diverse structures with opposite chirality (e.g., right&#8208;handed &#945;&#8208;helices and left&#8208;handed polyproline&#8208;II helices) for maintaining three&#8208;dimensional conformations and functions of biostructures, but realizing this process in artificial systems remains exceptional challenge due to difficulty in constructing precise noncovalent pattern for diverse chirality transfer. Herein, we report a strategy to fabricate helical nanofibers featuring P and M sub&#8208;domains by delicately introducing symbiotic noncovalent sites in the terminal of l&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives (LCN). Benefiting from the conformation match of LCN, two symbiotic sites (C&#8801;N, Ar&#9472;Hortho) in terminal cyanophenyl group can synergistically form noncovalent with different sites (C&#8801;N&#8943;Hmeta&#9472;Ar; Ar&#9472;Hortho&#8943;N&#8801;C), resulting in a precise noncovalent network. Furthermore, these two noncovalent facilitate the simultaneous formation of M&#8208;type and P&#8208;type domains due to their opposite spatial direction. Similar phenomenon is also observed from symbiotic sites in another terminal hydroxy group (O, H), further confirming an unusual chirality transfer where molecular homochirality propagates to supramolecular domains with opposite handedness. Besides, these helical domains can further cooperatively organize into higher&#8208;order P&#8208;type helices, in which fiber longitudinal axes aligns with the screw axes of noncovalent&#8208;defined helices. This study accelerates the understanding of diverse chirality transfer based on homochirality in nature and takes into a realm of constructing helical nanostructures with diverse sub&#8208;helices by homochiral blocks.

         <title>DNA Glass: Encasing Diffraction&#8208;Quality, Mesoporous DNA Crystals in Architected Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling DNA crystals are used as a substrate to form ultrathin mesoporous silica composites using sol&#8211;gel chemistry; and X&#8208;ray crystallography allows for the recovery of the molecular structure of the underlying DNA lattice. These hybrid crystals are shown to be robust to a variety of physical and chemical stressors, amenable to dye soaking, and capable of templating the site&#8208;specific nucleation of silver nanoclusters. 








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling DNA crystals have emerged over the last two decades as an efficient and effective means of organizing matter at the nanoscale, but functionalization of these lattices has proved challenging as physiological buffer conditions are required to maintain structural integrity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the silicification of mesoporous DNA crystals using sol&#8211;gel chemistry. We identify reaction conditions that produce the minimum coating thickness to confer environmental protection, and we subsequently measure this protective ability to various stressors, including heat, low ionic strength solution, organic solvents, and unprotected freezing. By soaking metal ions and dyes into the lattice after silica coating, we demonstrate that the crystals maintain their pores and that the major groove of the DNA can still be used as a sequence&#8208;specific template for chemical reactions. We image a library of different crystal motifs by electron microscopy, and we perform X&#8208;ray diffraction on these crystals, both with and without cryoprotection, to determine the structure of the DNA frame, underscoring the conserved molecular order after coating. We anticipate these mesoporous silica composites will find use in applications involving extreme, nonphysiological conditions and in experiments which utilize the DNA glass described here as a template for chemical reactions on the internal surface of architected materials.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Mg&#8211;Pt Intermetallic Hydrogenation Catalysts for CO Poisoning Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to mitigate CO poisoning by designing electron&#8208;rich single Pt sites through phase control of Mg&#8211;Pt intermetallics. By adjusting the crystallinity of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Mg, we synthesized both Mg29Pt4 and Mg3Pt. The obtained Mg29Pt4 exhibits superior performance in quinoline hydrogenation with high CO tolerance, attributed to its electron&#8208;rich Pt sites and lower d&#8208;band center.








Abstract
Platinum group metals (PGMs) are efficient catalysts for industrial hydrogenation reactions but are extremely sensitive to CO (ppm levels), making the direct utilization of industrial crude hydrogen containing CO infeasible. Herein, we report the phase engineering of Mg&#8211;Pt intermetallic catalysts achieved through the precise control of reactive metal&#8211;support interactions (RMSIs) between Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Mg supports. By manipulating Pt crystallinity, we synthesized two distinct phases, Mg29Pt4 and Mg3Pt. In the presence of CO, Mg29Pt4 demonstrates remarkable activity for selective hydrogenation reactions, contrasting sharply with the almost complete deactivation of metallic Pt. Notably, Mg29Pt4 retains &#8764;88% of its original activity when exposed to 0.2 vol% CO, a typical industrial crude hydrogen concentration, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;Pt catalysts. This superior CO tolerance arises from its electron&#8208;rich Pt sites and low d&#8208;band center, which suppress electron donation from CO 5&#963; orbitals to Pt 5d orbitals while hindering electron back&#8208;donation from Pt d orbitals to CO 2&#960;* antibonding orbitals. Moreover, Mg29Pt4 also facilitates the hydrogenation of diverse functional groups, including alkynes, aldehydes, and nitroarenes, while maintaining excellent CO tolerance. This work demonstrates that manipulating the electronic properties of Pt single&#8208;atom sites can alter CO adsorption behavior, enabling the design of efficient Pt catalysts for anti&#8208;CO poisoning.

         <title>Direct Access to Acylboranes via Formal Condensation of Carboxylic Acids with Ligated Boranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed, radical&#8208;based C(acyl)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling strategy has been developed for the efficient synthesis of bench&#8208;stable, phosphonite&#8208;ligated acylborane compounds from readily available carboxylic acids. This methodology not only provides access to acylboranes with diverse reactivity profiles but also establishes a versatile platform for the direct construction of stabilized organoborane species, which has currently been extended to C(aryl) systems.








Abstract
The unique synthetic potential of acylboron species has long attracted attention from the synthetic chemistry community, but their broader application has been limited by challenges associated with their preparation. In this work, we report a mechanistically distinct radical&#8208;based C(acyl)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling strategy that enables a &#8220;formal condensation&#8221; between readily available carboxylic acids and easily accessible ligated boranes. The success of this transformation relies on the distinctive use of a phosphonite ligand, which achieves an optimal balance between the stability and reactivity of the borane moiety. This method demonstrates a broad substrate scope with high practical utility, and its strategic value has been further highlighted through diverse downstream derivatizations of the resulting acylborane compounds.

         <title>Spatial Decoupling of Adsorption and Transformation Sites on Ag&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically paired neighboring Ag and Cu sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with their synergistic functions enable photocatalytic tandem nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion under visible light irradiation via the creation of an unique microenvironment: Cu sites adsorb and activate NO3&#8211;, whereas adjacent Ag sites stabilize *NO intermediates and modulate the proton supply suppressing the hydrogen reaction evolution for achieving fast spatially decoupling adsorption&#8208;transformation pathways with 98% NH3 selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8211;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) presents a sustainable solution for simultaneous NH3 synthesis and wastewater remediation. However, achieving high selectivity is challenging, plagued by sluggish kinetics and parasitic side reactions. In this study, we rationally design a synergistic Ag&#8208;Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst on g&#8208;C3N4 (AgCu&#8208;CN) that embodies a spatially decoupled tandem scheme. We demonstrate that the oxophilic Cu1 site serve as Lewis acid centers to efficiently capture and activate NO3&#8211;, before the crucial *NO intermediate is shuttled to adjacent Ag1 site, which is intrinsically inert toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, act as dedicated hydrogenation center for rapid and deep *NO reduction. This atomic&#8208;level synergy manifests in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, with AgCu&#8208;CN delivering an impressive 98% NH3 selectivity and a production rate of 630.5&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under visible light. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations corroborate the tandem mechanism and the critical role of the Ag&#8208;Cu dual sites in steering reaction selectivity. This study establishes a powerful tandem catalytic design principle to manage the selectivity challenges in complex multi&#8208;proton/electron reactions.

         <title>Chlorinated&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Lithium Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a chlorinated&#8208;solvent&#8208;base electrolyte (CSE) composed of a chlorinated ether and a chlorinated carbonate to develope the efficiently fire&#8208;retardant electrolyte even with lithiated anodes. The LiCl and LiF enriched SEI helpt the graphite|CSE|LFP full cells exhibit an extended cyclability over 1000 cycles, and decreased the byproducts formation and gas evolution compared with cells using traditional carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte.








Abstract
The current lithium battery technology is greatly limited by safety concerns. Fluorinated and organophosphorus solvents can reduce the electrolyte flammability. However, these solvents are not fire&#8208;retardant efficiently for lithiated anodes. Here, for the first time, we report an all&#8208;chlorinated&#8208;solvent design strategy to enable electrolytes with durability, non&#8208;flammability and fire&#8208;proof. We demonstrate that the premature battery failure in chlorinated ether electrolytes is mainly caused by the low anode compatibility and aluminum current collector corrosion originating from the dissolution of LiCl&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which can be efficiently overcome by interphase regulation via film&#8208;forming chlorinated carbonate and promoted anion reduction. These insights were applied to graphite||LiFePO4 full cells, which presented high capacity retention together with promising safety assurance under thermal, electrical and mechanical abuse conditions, outperforming traditional electrolytes. We also applied the as&#8208;developed fire&#8208;proof electrolytes to 4.4&#160;V high&#8208;loading Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells and attained durable cycling features without current collector corrosion. This work provides the design criteria for developing fire&#8208;retardant electrolytes for highly safe lithium batteries.

High&#8208;entropy topologically close&#8208;packed Ir alloys enable interatomic hydrogen spillover from oxophilic sites (Pr/Nd/Tb) to nucleophilic sites (Ir/Rh), serving as efficient HER electrocatalysts for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs).The AEMWE equipped with the C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb cathode delivers a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.69&#160;V with stable operation for over 2000&#160;h (64 &#181;V h&#8722;1 loss).








Abstract
The efficiency of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is strictly restricted by the insufficient active hydrogen supply. Here, we develop high&#8208;entropy topologically close&#8208;packed C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb nanocrystals with enhanced interatomic hydrogen spillover from oxophilic sites (Pr/Nd/Tb) to nucleophilic sites (Ir/Rh) as efficient HER electrocatalysts for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Compared to the disordered (A1) counterpart, intermetallic C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb features a higher coordination number for Pr/Nd/Tb and a more electron&#8208;rich environment for Ir/Rh with compressed Ir&#8211;Ir(Rh) bonds. In 1.0&#160;M KOH, C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb reveals an ultralow HER overpotential of only 8 and 34&#160;mV to reach 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The AEMWE with C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb cathode delivers an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at only 1.69&#160;V, and could be operated stably for over 2000&#160;h (64 &#181;V h&#8722;1 loss), representing one of the best alkaline HER catalysts ever reported. The markedly enhanced hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics on C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb demonstrates an additional active hydrogen migration step via hydrogen spillover during HER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong d&#8208;f orbital coupling in C15&#8208;(IrRh)2PrNdTb establishes efficient interatomic hydrogen spillover pathways through Pr(Nd/Tb)&#8211;Ir(Rh) hollow site to Ir(Rh)&#8211;Ir(Rh) bridge site to Ir(Rh)&#8211;Ir(Rh) hollow site, thereby accelerating HER kinetics.

         <title>Synergistic SuFEx&#8208;Driven Covalent Cancer Therapy Using a HER2/EGFR Bivalent Affinity Protein Drug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from multivalent interactions, the binding of the bivalent AAA&#8208;PE24 molecule to the HER2 (or EGFR) target can cooperatively facilitate its binding to the EGFR (or HER2) target, thereby enhancing the affinity and contact between the drug and targets. This, in turn, promotes proximity&#8208;enabled sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reactions with the target proteins, significantly improving the covalent crosslinking efficiency of the protein drug.








Abstract
The integration of sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry into proteins is significantly advancing their applications in biological fields. However, its suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit the effectiveness of covalent crosslinking. In this study, we develop a bivalent affinity protein drug by chemically coupling maleimide&#8208;substituted aryl fluorosulfate (MFS) linkers to a dual&#8208;targeting affinity protein drug that can covalently target both HER2 and EGFR. Benefiting from the HER2/EGFR ligand&#8208;assisted multivalent interactions, the obtained bivalent affinity protein drug with two MFS warheads exhibits an enhancement of covalent cross&#8208;link performance, which is 440% and 630% higher than that of monovalent ones. Generally, the bivalent affinity protein drug achieves over 80% covalent binding efficiency to its targets within 12&#160;h and ultimately achieves 290% to 340% higher intracellular uptake and 360% to 460% longer tumor retention compared with that of monovalent or non&#8208;covalent control. Consequently, this bivalent affinity protein drug showed extraordinary antitumor efficacy in HER2/EGFR&#8208;positive pancreatic tumor models with a tumor inhibition rate (TIR) of 90.4%, which was significantly higher than that of monovalent or non&#8208;covalent ones (28.4% to 66.9%). In brief, this SuFEx&#8208;engineered, bivalent targeted strategy provides a promising platform for the design of covalent protein drugs in the future.

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960; Mediated Weak Solvation Chemistry Enables Dendrite&#8208;Suppressed Gel Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reveal that the off&#8208;domain &#960;&#8208;electron cloud of the aromatic ring in the side chains can introduce cation&#8722;&#960; interactions to engineer weakly solvated structures, substantially reducing desolvation barriers. This is because cation&#8722;&#960; interactions competitively disrupt Li+&#8722;solvent coordination, attenuating binding forces between Li+ and solvent molecules to promote rapid interfacial kinetics, thereby enhancing interfacial stability.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), despite their flexibility, non&#8208;leakage, and processability as promising candidates of electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, persistently face the challenge of high desolvation energy caused by robust solvation interactions. Such high desolvation energy compromises interfacial kinetics, resulting in uneven lithium deposition and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. In this study, we reveal that the off&#8208;domain &#960;&#8208;electron cloud of the aromatic ring in the side chains can introduce cation&#8722;&#960; interactions to engineer weakly solvated structures, substantially reducing desolvation barriers. In addition, it is demonstrated that cation&#8722;&#960; interactions competitively disrupt Li+&#8722;solvent coordination, attenuating binding forces between Li+ and solvent molecules to promote rapid interfacial kinetics, thereby suppressing the lithium dendrite growth and enhancing interfacial stability. As a result, the cation&#8722;&#960; chemistry enables Li||Li symmetric cell to achieve stable lithium plating/stripping over 2000&#160;h, whereas Li||LFP full cell retains 91.6% capacity after 900 cycles at 1 C. Remarkably, 1.0 Ah pouch cell preserves 94.6% capacity after 300 cycles, and the 4.5 Ah pouch cell delivers a stable energy density of 321&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This cation&#8722;&#960; mediated weak solvation chemistry provides valuable guidance for developing high&#8208;performance gel polymer lithium batteries.

         <title>A Universal Principle of Lithium Bond Characteristics in Lithium Battery Electrolytes</title>

A coordination number of four serves as a universal boundary between lithium bonds and ionic bonds. The electrolyte components determine the proportion and duration of lithium bonds, and 7Li NMR response by affecting the environment around lithium.








Abstract
Understanding the interactions between lithium (Li) and coordinated compounds is fundamental to elucidating the working mechanisms of Li batteries and informing the design principles of emerging battery materials. Li bonds, analogous to hydrogen bonds, play a central role in these interactions. However, the characteristics of Li bonds in working Li batteries are not fully explored due to the complexity of battery systems, hindering the advancement of Li bond theory in working batteries. In this work, a universal principle of Li bonds is established by combining theoretical calculations and machine learning techniques. Using organic electrolytes as modeling systems, the universal existence of Li bonds was first verified, particularly under high&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration conditions. A distinct characteristic of a coordination number of four was also demonstrated, distinguishing Li bonds from ionic bonds, consistent with electron localization region deviations around Li&#8208;ions. The influence of electrolyte components on Li bond characteristics was further revealed by 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and an ensemble machine learning model was constructed that quantitatively predicts 7Li NMR chemical shifts with high accuracy. This work establishes a universal principle of Li bond characteristics in batteries, advancing fundamental Li chemistry, and guiding rational design for next&#8208;generation Li batteries.

Azasilabenzene: Gas&#8208;phase synthesis of a rare class of silicon&#8212;and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles via crossed molecular beam experiments and electronic structure calculations.

Abstract
Nature has long favored cyclic, particularly heterocyclic, molecules in the synthesis of key biomolecules. Silicon&#8208;substituted hydrocarbons have gained increasing attention due to their unique chemical bonding and electronic structure compared to their iso&#8208;valent carbon counterparts. However, the synthesis of silicon&#8208;containing heterocyclic molecules remains a significant challenge. In this work, we investigate the reaction mechanism leading to a sparsely explored class of silicon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles, in which silicon and nitrogen atoms are positioned adjacently within an aromatic, six&#8208;membered ring: azasilabenzenes. This is achieved through the reaction of the silicon nitride (SiN) radical with 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) via single collision conditions, exploiting a crossed molecular beam experiment combined with electronic structure calculations and statistical analysis. Our results reveal the formation of two novel cyclic products: 1&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;silacyclohexa&#8208;3,5&#8208;dien&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene and 1&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;silabenzene. Interestingly, this reaction contrasts with the iso&#8208;valent system involving the cyano radical (CN) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6), which predominantly yields an acyclic product (1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene) via a simple addition&#8211;elimination pathway. In addition to elucidating the reaction pathways, this study also provides insights into the nature of bonding and atomic interactions in the resulting products, offering a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;stability relationships in silicon&#8211;nitrogen heterocycles and the counterintuitive concept of iso&#8208;valency.

         <title>DFT&#8208;Guided Design and Synthesis of Bipyridine&#8208;Anchored Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction Across a Broad pH Range</title>

         <dc:description>
An integrated approach, combining theoretical screening and precise synthesis, is presented for the design of bipyridine&#8208;anchored Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia across a broad pH range, spanning acidic to alkaline conditions. The exceptional performance of these bipyridine&#8208;Cu sites in the NO3RR is attributed to their enhanced interfacial water dissociation and efficient hydrogenation capabilities, which facilitate the selective conversion of NOx intermediates to ammonia.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia represents an efficient approach to alleviate nitrate pollution, concurrently providing a sustainable strategy for ammonia synthesis. The development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts that exhibit both high activity and selectivity in nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) constitutes a substantial challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for the NO3RR through theoretical screening and precise synthesis techniques. A series of bipyridine&#8208;anchored 3d transition metal SACs has been computationally pre&#8208;evaluated for their NO3RR activity and selectivity, and bipyridine&#8208;Cu SAC stands out as the optimal candidate. Guided by the computational predictions, the bipyridine&#8208;Cu encapsulated inside a zirconium&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (namely Cu&#8208;SA/UiO&#8208;bpy) is synthesized and achieves an impressive ammonia yield rate of 7.4 mgNH3 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a faradaic efficiency of 98.1% in NO3RR under neutral conditions. Additionally, Cu&#8208;SA/UiO&#8208;bpy exhibits remarkable catalytic performance (FE&#160;&gt;&#160;90%) across a wide pH range. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations further reveal that bipyridine&#8208;Cu sites facilitate the interfacial dissociation of water and the efficient generation of reactive hydrogen species, enabling the selective hydrogenation of NOx intermediates into ammonia. This integration of a data&#8208;driven approach with precise synthesis presents a novel paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts toward NO3RR and other catalytic applications.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Shell Engineering Enables Additive&#8208;Dominated Coordination for Stable Silicon Anodes Under Minimal Salt Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We establish a fluorinated additive&#8208;dominated solvation sheath structure via minimal concentration electrolyte (0.2&#160;M), which fully performs the SEI&#8208;forming functionality of additive and significantly enhances the structural/interfacial stability of Si anode. This strategy is expected to provide valuable guidance for designing cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrolytes.








Abstract
Constructing a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is essential for enabling high&#8208;capacity alloying anodes in next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, conventional strategies based on high salt concentrations or expensive additives are limited by high cost, viscosity, and poor compatibility. Herein, we develop a solvation engineering strategy to increase the coordination number of additive molecules in the Li&#8314; solvation shell by minimizing anion participation. A low&#8208;salt electrolyte composed of 0.2&#160;M LiFSI (LiPF6) in DMM/THF/FEC (4:3:3 by vol%) enables additive&#8208;dominated coordination and facilitates the formation of a uniform, fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Characterizations including molecular dynamics simulations, spectroscopy, and 3D electrode reconstruction confirm this tailored solvation environment stabilizes the Si interface and mitigates volume&#8208;induced degradation. As a result, silicon anode exhibits a specific capacity of &#8764;2000&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 over 200 cycles, while graphite anodes retain 96% capacity after 500 cycles. Stable cycling performances can also be achieved in different pouch cells. This work underscores the critical importance of additive coordination control in electrolyte design and provides a broadly applicable, cost&#8208;effective strategy for advancing alloy&#8208;type anodes in practical LIB systems.

Directional N removal strategy through H2 pyrolysis yields Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C sub&#8208;nanoclusters from Ni&#9472;N&#9472;C precursors with enhanced CO2RR performance.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), particularly the protonation step is widely recognized as the kinetic bottleneck in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Modulating catalyst microstructures to accelerate protonation has thus emerged as a promising strategy to boost from CO2 to CO selectivity. Here, we report ultrasmall Ni nanocluster catalysts (denoted as Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C) prepared via one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Ni&#8208;containing precursors under H2 atmosphere. Compared to conventional Ni&#9472;N&#9472;C with symmetric Ni&#9472;N4 motifs, Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C displays similar physicochemical characteristics&#8212;Ni loading, defect density, surface area&#8212;yet exhibits distinct local Ni coordination environments. These sub&#8208;nanoclusters markedly enhance CO2RR performance, delivering&#160;&gt;&#160;90% CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) across &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, with a peak FECO of &#8764;95% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C substantially lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation owing to altered adsorption configurations, thereby facilitating the rate&#8208;limiting protonation step. In situ FTIR measurements further confirm the accelerated *COOH formation on Ni3&#9472;N&#9472;C surfaces. This work highlights the critical role of Ni sub&#8208;nanoclusters in PCET modulation and establishes a rational design principle for nanocluster&#8208;based catalysts in CO2RR.

         <title>Steric Pruning Unlocks Hierarchical Structuring, Thermochromism, C&#8208;H/O Activation, and 6&#8208;electron Redox Transmetalation in Planar Bismuth Triamides</title>

Reducing steric bulk unlocks remarkable new physical phenomena such as epitaxial and hierarchical ordering, thermochromism, C&#9472;H/O activation, and multi&#8208;electron redox transmetalation in planar bismuth triamides. These have all been hidden by the classical use of bulky substituents in this area. These results reveal exciting new properties for geometrically deformed compounds while dispelling the innocence of commonly used W(0) Lewis acids.








Abstract
Planar bismuth triamides with tunable stereoelectronics offer a versatile platform for studying the effects of geometric constraints in p&#8208;block elements. Here we show that exploring the low steric bulk regime in these compounds unlocks categorically new phenomena such as epitaxial hierarchical ordering, thermochromism, C&#9472;H/O activation, and 6&#8208;electron pincer&#8208;to&#8208;pincer redox transmetalation. These behaviors are not observed in sterically encumbered derivatives, emphasizing the role of steric modulation in unlocking new phenomena in geometrically&#8208;constrained main group complexes.

         <title>An All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Cu Battery via Cuprous/Lithium&#8208;Ion Halide Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work synthesizes a Cu&#8314; halide solid electrolyte (Cu2ZrCl6) with low migration energy barrier for ion conduction and high Cu&#8314; conductivity/solubility and constructs a model of synergistic migration and ion exchange of Cu&#8314; and Li&#8314; in related electrolytes. Therefore, the first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;copper battery (ASSLCB) is assembled (delivering 360 mAh g&#8722;1 reversible capacity), with a cathode&#8208;free counterpart also designed.








Abstract
The Cu cathode has great potential due to its low cost and high capacity. However, the limited ionic conductivity of the electrolyte for Cu ions and poor solubility of Cu species severely hinder the rapid development of Li&#8211;Cu batteries. Herein, we synthesized a Cu+ halide solid electrolyte (Cu2ZrCl6, CZC) by mechanochemical method, which exhibited a high room&#8208;temperature Cu+ conductivity (about 14 mS cm&#8722;1) and high solubility of Cu species. The Cu||CZC||Cu symmetric battery demonstrated the ability to maintain stable Cu+ plating/stripping over 1000 h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. We further constructed a model of the synergistic migration and ion exchange of Cu+ and Li+ in CZC and Li2ZrCl6 electrolytes. Based on this, we assembled the first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;copper battery (ASSLCB), which delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 360 mAh g&#8722;1 (1.7&#8211;3.8&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li, at 37&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and exhibited outstanding cycling performance across 50 cycles at a current of 62.5&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Additionally, we designed a cathode&#8208;free ASSLCB, utilizing aluminum foil as the current collector to demonstrate the deposition and dissolution of pure copper metal. This study provides a new design concept for Cu+ conductors and lays a foundation for the future research of ASSLCBs.

         <title>Crystal Packing&#8211;Trajectory Correlation in Topochemical Photoisomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines topochemical photoisomerization in salicylhydrazone crystals. Analysis of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and local free volume shows that adequate steric freedom near reactive bonds enables photochromism. Comparing slipped vs. cofacial stacking highlights how packing governs reactivity. We propose &#8220;pedal space&#8221; as a descriptor for predicting solid&#8208;state photoreactivity.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photoisomerization is often associated with loosely packed molecular arrangements that allow conformational flexibility. In this study, we explore this premise by synthesizing a library of salicylhydrazone derivatives, 16 of which were successfully crystallized and analyzed. Notably, several planarly close&#8208;packed crystals exhibited clear photochromic responses when their local environments provided sufficient steric freedom near the reactive bonds. By systematically examining &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking motifs and quantifying accessible volume along the isomerization trajectory, we reveal a robust correlation between local free volume and photoresponse. From these insights, we develop a crystal&#8208;structure based molecular descriptor that condenses the steric environment into a single&#8208;parameter, the &#8220;pedal space&#8221; and identify a critical threshold for solid&#8208;state photoreactivity. We term this phenomenon topochemical photoisomerization, highlighting how subtle variations in molecular packing, such as slipped versus co&#8208;facial stacking in N&#8208;salicylideneaniline derivatives, dictate the resulting photochemical pathways. This study establishes a structural framework for the rational design of solid&#8208;state photoswitchable materials through crystal&#8208;engineering principles in silico, offering a route toward rapid, and cost&#8208;effective development of responsive optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Spatially Selective Substitution for Structural Stabilization of Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially selective multi&#8208;element substitution strategy stabilizes O3&#8208;type sodium layered oxides by enabling a well&#8208;regulated O3&#160;&#8594;&#160;P3 phase transition.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the strong anchoring effect of B and the pronounced B&#9472;O covalent bonding strengthen the P3 framework, resulting in superior high&#8208;temperature performance and long&#8208;term full&#8208;cell cyclability. 








Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered transition metal oxides are considered promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high capacity and favorable Na+ storage characteristics. However, their practical application is severely hindered by structural instability associated with multiphase transitions during electrochemical cycling. Herein, we propose a spatially selective multi&#8208;element substitution strategy that induces spatially differentiated distributions of Mg, Cu, Ti, and B, thereby enhancing structural robustness. This spatially differentiated substitution architecture synergistically improves structural stability by concurrently inhibiting interfacial degradation and strengthening the lattice framework. The optimized composition (NaNi0.4Mg0.05Cu0.05Mn0.3Ti0.2B0.05O2) enables a stabilized O3&#160;&#8594;&#160;P3 phase transition, which relieves lattice distortion and suppresses structural collapse upon cycling. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis reveals that the strong covalency of B&#9472;O bonds is crucial for anchoring the P3 framework. Hence, it delivers superior high&#8208;temperature performance in half cells and durable cycling in full cells (85% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.5 C within 1.9&#8211;3.9&#160;V). By elucidating the role of spatially selective substitution in structural stabilization, this work provides fundamental insights and paves the way for the design of advanced SIB cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;A spatially selective multi-element substitution strategy stabilizes O3-type sodium layered oxides by enabling a well-regulated O3&#160;&#8594;&#160;P3 phase transition.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the strong anchoring effect of B and the pronounced B&#9472;O covalent bonding strengthen the P3 framework, resulting in superior high-temperature performance and long-term full-cell cyclability. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O3-type layered transition metal oxides are considered promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high capacity and favorable Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage characteristics. However, their practical application is severely hindered by structural instability associated with multiphase transitions during electrochemical cycling. Herein, we propose a spatially selective multi-element substitution strategy that induces spatially differentiated distributions of Mg, Cu, Ti, and B, thereby enhancing structural robustness. This spatially differentiated substitution architecture synergistically improves structural stability by concurrently inhibiting interfacial degradation and strengthening the lattice framework. The optimized composition (NaNi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) enables a stabilized O3&#160;&#8594;&#160;P3 phase transition, which relieves lattice distortion and suppresses structural collapse upon cycling. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis reveals that the strong covalency of B&#9472;O bonds is crucial for anchoring the P3 framework. Hence, it delivers superior high-temperature performance in half cells and durable cycling in full cells (85% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.5 C within 1.9&#8211;3.9&#160;V). By elucidating the role of spatially selective substitution in structural stabilization, this work provides fundamental insights and paves the way for the design of advanced SIB cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C&#8211;H Olefination of BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H olefination and desymmetrization strategy has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of axially chiral BODIPYs with exceptional stereocontrol and broad functional group tolerance.








Abstract
Enantioenriched BODIPYs have emerged as a class of exceptionally valuable fluorophores, distinguished by their remarkable chiroptical properties and versatile applications in bioimaging, molecular sensing, and optoelectronic materials. The development of asymmetric catalytic methodologies for their synthesis represents a significant advancement in this field. Herein, we present a robust and efficient strategy for the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H olefination and desymmetrization at the &#947;&#8208;position of BODIPYs, facilitated by a thioether directing group and a chiral amino acid&#8208;derived ligand. This oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction enables the direct synthesis of a wide array of axially chiral BODIPY derivatives with exceptional E&#8208;selectivity and outstanding enantioselectivities. The resultant chiral fluorophores exhibit tunable photophysical properties, including near&#8208;infrared emission and robust circularly polarized luminescence, and demonstrate excellent biocompatibility in live&#8208;cell imaging. This method establishes a comprehensive platform for the streamlined synthesis of axially chiral BODIPYs, thereby advancing their potential applications in cutting&#8208;edge photonic, biological, and optoelectronic technologies.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Spin&#8208;Orbit Modulated Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated FeP/Fe3O4 Heterojunctions for Ultrafast and Stable Conversion of Low&#8208;Concentration Nitrate to Ammonia</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;encapsulated FeP/Fe3O4 heterojunction utilizes interface&#8208;driven spin&#8208;orbit orientation to induce the transition from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin, elevate Fe 3d energy level, and promote electron migration from FeP to Fe3O4. The reconfigured state optimizes the N&#8208;O intermediate binding and H* overflow, enabling ultrafast NH3 synthesis from dilute NO3&#8722;. The carbon shell alleviates phosphate poisoning, ensuring robustness in complex wastewater.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction offers an effective route for ammonia synthesis and actual wastewater treatment. Despite some important achievements, the progress is still low than expected, especially in low&#8208;concentration nitrate, mostly because of slow hydrogenation kinetics and interfering substances. In this work, we presented that, by engineering spin orbital orientation, a carbon&#8208;encapsulated FeP/Fe3O4 heterojunctions (FeP/Fe3O4@C) enabled ultrafast and stable NH3 electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration nitrate. In&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculation confirmed that FeP/Fe3O4 heterojunctions induced spin orbit splitting of Fe, resulting in electron transition from low spin to high spin. The resulted non&#8208;degenerate orbitals caused the energy levels shift up and guided the electron migration from FeP to Fe3O4, which thus activated additional 3d orbital electron states. This spin orbital orientation further optimized the chemisorption properties of nitrogen&#8208;oxygen intermediates and H* spillover, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics for ultrafast NH3 electrosynthesis. Meanwhile, FeP/Fe3O4@C electrocatalyst alleviated the phosphate poisoning of active metal sites during industrial wastewater treatment, demonstrating excellent anti&#8208;interference capability and environmental sustainability for real application. This work by modulating the &#8220;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbit&#8221; structure of active sites provided a new strategy for rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for various electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Chiral Boron&#8211;Formazanates as a Multifunctional NIR Chiroptical Platform: Modular Synthesis, Photothermal Conversion, and Reversible Acid&#8211;Base Chiroptical Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis of two classes of chiral boron&#8211;formazanates affords enantiopure NIR chiroptical platforms without chiral resolution. Selected members display aggregation&#8208;induced emission, high photothermal conversion enabling red&#8208;light polymerization, and fully reversible acid&#8211;base CD switching, offering a versatile framework for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;responsive chiral materials.








Abstract
Chiral organic materials with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) optical activity are highly sought after for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications but remain rare. Here, we report two complementary types of chiral boron&#8211;formazanates: 1) mono&#8208;formazanates bearing 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;derived chiral ligands at boron, and 2) bis&#8208;formazanates with embedded chiral backbones, both prepared in enantiopure form (ee&#160;&gt;&#160;95%) via modular synthetic routes without chiral resolution. To our knowledge, these represent the first reported examples of optically pure formazanates. This enables direct evaluation of their intrinsic optical and chiroptical properties, which include broadband NIR circular dichroism (CD) activity and, in selected cases, NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), NIR circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity beyond 800&#160;nm, and fully reversible acid&#8211;base chiroptical switching. Mono&#8208;formazanates show high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion and serve as efficient photothermal catalysts for red&#8208;light&#8208;mediated polymerization, while bis&#8208;formazanates exhibit amplified chiroptical responses via exciton&#8208;like coupling. TD&#8208;DFT calculations unveiled the mechanistic aspects of broadband Cotton effects in mono&#8208;formazanates, exciton&#8208;like coupling in bis&#8208;formazanates, and protonation&#8208;induced inversion of chiroptical signals. This work establishes chiral formazanates as a versatile molecular platform for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;active chiroptical materials with potential utility in bioimaging, sensing, photothermal therapy, and responsive chiroptical devices.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Orientation of Multi&#8208;Site Ligand Enables Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Voltage Exceeding 2&#160;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We concurrently suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhance electron transfer at the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite/C60 interface via a planar triple&#8208;site molecule, 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid. It preferentially adopts a parallel adsorption orientation, thus reducing the resistance barrier and enhancing electron transfer. Consequently, the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 2&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 31.42%.








Abstract
Rational molecular design at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface offers an effective approach for suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSC). However, the design involves a tradeoff between defect passivation and charge transport, as multi&#8208;site passivation molecules always introduce a resistive barrier. Herein, we employ a triple&#8208;site planar molecule, 3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (3A4Cl&#8208;BZS), as a multifunctional modifier that can concurrently suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhance electron transfer. Specifically, functionalizing the benzene ring with sulfonic acid (&#8208;SO3H) and amino (&#8208;NH2) groups enhances the passivation of undercoordinated Pb2+ and I&#8722; defects via coordination and hydrogen bonding, respectively, and incorporating a chlorine group promotes the parallel adsorption on the perovskite surface. The parallel configuration, rather than vertical orientation, minimizes the distance between the active site and the perovskite defects, significantly boosting passivation efficacy and mitigating the resistive barrier. Consequently, 1.67&#160;eV bandgap perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.55%. Furthermore, integrating this cell into perovskite/silicon TSC yields a high voltage of over 2 volts and a PCE of 31.42% adopting a planar silicon sub&#8208;cell.

&lt;p&gt;We concurrently suppress non-radiative recombination and enhance electron transfer at the wide-bandgap perovskite/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interface via a planar triple-site molecule, 3-amino-4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid. It preferentially adopts a parallel adsorption orientation, thus reducing the resistance barrier and enhancing electron transfer. Consequently, the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell achieved an open-circuit voltage exceeding 2&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 31.42%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational molecular design at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface offers an effective approach for suppressing non-radiative recombination in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSC). However, the design involves a tradeoff between defect passivation and charge transport, as multi-site passivation molecules always introduce a resistive barrier. Herein, we employ a triple-site planar molecule, 3-amino-4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (3A4Cl-BZS), as a multifunctional modifier that can concurrently suppress non-radiative recombination and enhance electron transfer. Specifically, functionalizing the benzene ring with sulfonic acid (-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H) and amino (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) groups enhances the passivation of undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; defects via coordination and hydrogen bonding, respectively, and incorporating a chlorine group promotes the parallel adsorption on the perovskite surface. The parallel configuration, rather than vertical orientation, minimizes the distance between the active site and the perovskite defects, significantly boosting passivation efficacy and mitigating the resistive barrier. Consequently, 1.67&#160;eV bandgap perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.55%. Furthermore, integrating this cell into perovskite/silicon TSC yields a high voltage of over 2 volts and a PCE of 31.42% adopting a planar silicon sub-cell. Remarkably, encapsulated tandem devices retain over 80% of their initial PCE after 1960 h of maximum power point tracking under 1-sun illumination at 25 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking in Carbon Nanohoops Enables Room&#8208;Temperature Ternary Single&#8208;Molecule Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three pyrene&#8208;embedded nanohoops with distinct molecular symmetries were synthesized. Symmetry engineering discretizes the tunneling pathways, yielding three stable conductance states at room temperature.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule electronics offers chemically encoded routes to ultra&#8208;dense information processing, yet room&#8208;temperature operation is often limited to binary conductance states due to thermal broadening and electronic averaging. Here we demonstrate robust ternary switching at room temperature using symmetry&#8208;engineered carbon nanohoops. Embedding a pyrene unit into the [12]cycloparaphenylene backbone via a symmetry&#8208;breaking 1,6&#8208;linkage disrupts the electronic equivalence of &#960;&#8211;segments and localizes frontier orbitals. Under controlled mechanical elongation in single&#8211;molecule junctions, the molecule exhibits three well&#8208;resolved conductance plateaus, each separated by &#8764;one order of magnitude, affording unambiguous and reproducible readout. First&#8208;principles transport calculations reveal that symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8211;induced orbital localization discretizes coherent tunneling pathways, accounting for the observed plateaus. These findings establish molecular symmetry control as a general design principle for room&#8208;temperature multistate charge transport in conjugated macrocycles, opening a pathway to high&#8208;density single&#8208;molecule logic architectures.

         <title>Beyond Local Coordination: How Global Structure Engineers the Selectivity of Single Atom Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite identical CoN4 active sites, carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit different CO2 reduction selectivity. The global structure governs interfacial charge distribution and water orientation, thereby controlling reaction selectivity beyond local coordination.








Abstract
The local structure of the active center is generally believed to determine the catalytic performance, but this rule fails in many situations. One of the representative cases is carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), where Ndoped carbon (NC) and phthalocyanine (Pc) substrates usually endow the same active center (MN4) with different performance. Herein, we unveiled an intrinsic global&#8211;local interplay mechanism, in which global structural engineering, coupled with local&#8208;site sensitivity, determines the catalytic performance of SACs. Specifically, the similar local active sites yield comparable d&#8208;band centers and reaction thermodynamics, while the distinct global structures induce markedly different potentials of zero charge (PZC). This disparity leads to the varying electron accommodation capacity and interfacial water orientation, altering the reaction energetics. Moreover, the degree of this global effect critically depends on the sensitivity of the local charge of the active site to the global structural variation. As a result, Co SACs, with greater sensitivity than Fe and Ni SACs, exhibit completely opposite selectivity between CoNC and CoPc. Our work transcends the conventional local&#8208;site paradigm and highlights the important role of global structure, in concert with local sensitivity, in governing catalytic performance.

         <title>Reaction of Blatter and Verdazyl Radicals with Arynes: Synthesis and Investigation of N&#8208;Chiral, Antiaromatic Triazines, and Tetrazinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study a novel radical annulation reaction mode of Blatter and verdazyl radicals with arynes is demonstrated which offers access to antiaromatic and N&#8208;chiral triazines and tetrazinones. The photophysical and electrochemical properties are investigated revealing their potential for application in materials science.








Abstract
Arynes are versatile building blocks in organic chemistry. In contrast to their extensively examined ionic reactivity, radical reactions with arynes remain scarcely explored. In this study, we present a novel radical annulation reaction of stable Blatter and verdazyl radicals with arynes, which offers access to polycyclic triazines and tetrazinones. The N2&#8208; and N4&#8208;annulated triazines derived from Blatter radicals exhibit distinct bending modes of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron triazine ring, yet retain a certain degree of antiaromaticity despite their nonplanar geometries, as revealed by NICS and ACID calculations. Notably, the N2&#8208;annulated triazines feature a strongly pyramidalized nitrogen atom with N&#8208;chirality. Optical resolution yielded pure enantiomers, from which the configurational stability was assessed to determine the N&#8208;inversion barrier. Furthermore, one of the N2&#8208;annulated triazine derivatives displayed intense fluorescence, highlighting its potential as a scaffold for light&#8208;emitting materials, whereas H&#8208;cell cycling studies of the N4&#8208;annulated triazine derivatives demonstrated long&#8208;term stability of the redox process underscoring their utility for battery applications.

         <title>Decarboxylative Arene Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biodegradation pathway of benzoic acid, a novel decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening strategy with a tailored nitrogenation reagent has been developed, which enables efficient arene ring cleavage. This process unlocks new synthetic pathways for challenging aromatic C&#9472;C bond cleavage reactions and demonstrates practical applicability in late&#8208;stage functionalization and molecular diversification strategies.








Abstract
Benzoic acids are widely utilized in synthetic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and materials science, yet their potential as precursors for linear synthons is severely constrained by the challenge of cleaving their highly stable aromatic C&#9472;C bonds. Here, we report that a PDPP (4&#8208;(piperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) and copper synergistically catalyzed nitrogenation of benzoic acids with a tailored nitrogenation reagent. This protocol efficiently enables the selective decarboxylation and benzene ring opening processes leading to acyclic dinitrile products. The designed new azide reagent plays an essential role in the PDPP&#8208;catalyzed initial step to trigger the selective carboxyl and aromatic C&#9472;C bond cleavage process. This synergistic strategy greatly expands the synthetic utility of benzoic acids, providing a direct and practical route to acyclic scaffolds. The aromatic ring&#8208;opening products could be further used in cyclization reactions to realize phenyl ring scaffold hopping.

         <title>A Molecular Machine Directs the Synthesis of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven molecular machine winds a flexible strand around a rigid axle to synthesize a rotaxane. This machine&#8208;directed approach enables access to molecular shapes previously unattainable by assembly or templating, demonstrating a generalizable strategy for expanding the chemical space of mechanically bonded molecules.








Abstract
Preorganization by assembly or templating strategies is frequently used in the synthesis of rotaxanes. While these approaches have led to complex interlocked molecules, they are often limited by strict compositional requirements of templates and starting materials. Here, we use a molecular machine to direct the synthesis of a rotaxane by active shaping of starting materials through mechanical winding. Light induced rotation of a molecular motor actively winds a molecular strand around an axle, forming discrete, thermodynamically disfavored crossings between these two parts. Covalent capture preserves the kinetically stable entanglements, transforming the strand into a macrocycle that is subsequently released and mechanically trapped on the axle, yielding a rotaxane. Our machine&#8208;directed strategy pioneers a new way of synthesizing rotaxanes by active mechanical shaping of molecular building blocks, enabling access to interlocked architectures beyond the reach of traditional assembly and templating approaches.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Reaction of Unactivated Alkyl Halides, 1,3&#8208;Enynes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0&#8208;triggered cascade process from simple alkyl halides and 1,3&#8208;enynes, via radical generation, addition, radical&#8211;NiI recombination and isomerization, yields nucleophilic allenylnickel(I) intermediates after in situ reduction with Mn, which can attack aldehydes to afford chiral homopropargylic alcohols in good yields with high stereoselectivity in the presence of PhCO2H.








Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;propargylnickel(II) complexes, or their resonances, the &#951;1&#8208;allenylnickel(II) ones, are typically generated from propargylic derivatives under Ni0 catalysis, and act as versatile electrophilic partners in diverse transformations. Here, we demonstrate that &#951;1&#8208;propargylnickel(II) species can alternatively be generated from unactivated alkyl halides and 1,3&#8208;enynes via a Ni0&#8208;mediated radical alkylation of the alkene. Subsequent isomerization to &#951;1&#8208;allenylnickel(II), followed by reduction, affords &#951;1&#8208;allenylnickel(I) intermediates, which serve as reliable nucleophilic species for the stereoselective addition to aldehydes in the presence of benzoic acid. This protocol features broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and nickel plays multiple roles in accomplishing a complicated Ni0/NiI/NiII/NiI/Ni0 catalytic cycle. A wide range of chiral homopropargylic alcohols, even the ones having a medium&#8208;sized ring, are modularly furnished in fair to good yields with moderate to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A series of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to illuminate the catalytic pathways and the origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Graphitic C6N6&#8208;Supported Dual Cu/Zn Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Mimicking Allosteric Regulation for Intelligent Switching Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible switch between SOD&#8208; and POD&#8208;like activities of Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6 with an efficiency of 90+% was obtained by alternating dark and light irradiation. Photoreduction along with different the Cu/Zn ratio adjusted the valence state and reduction potential, allowing the same active Cu center to perform distinctive switchable functions. This capability facilitated the detection of xanthine and glucose without crosstalk at a single sensing interface. 








Abstract
Self&#8208;adaptability is highly envisioned for artificial devices such as robots with chemical noses. To this end, seeking catalysts with reversibly switchable functions is promising but generally hampered by mismatched specific valence state of active centers for a certain type of catalytic activity. Herein, we report a graphitic C6N6&#8208;supported dual Cu/Zn single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6) with switchable functions triggered by light irradiation. Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6 exhibited highly efficient distinctive superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like (POD) activity under dark and light, respectively. Moreover, such switch between SOD&#8208; and POD&#8208;like activities were reversible by alternating dark and light irradiation with an efficiency more than 90%. The comprehensive experimental and TD&#8208;DFT calculations disclosed that both illumination and the Cu/Zn doping ratio modulate the reduction potential (&#966;red) by altering the potential energy surface and frontier orbital energies, thereby fine&#8208;tuning the SOD activity, making distinctive SOD&#8208; and POD&#8208;like activities originated from the same active center (Cu&#8208;Nx) but with different valence states, triggered by photoreduction. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6 was further confined to a microfluidic chip and applied to an intelligent single&#8208;interface biosensor with reversibly switched ability in detecting xanthine and glucose in vitro.

         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides was realized in high yields and with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. The protocol involved the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 1&#8208;iodoglycals and various phenols, followed by in situ reduction of the obtained ketene acetals with catecholborane. Its efficacy was proved by the late&#8208;stage modification of several natural products and drugs.








Abstract
Naturally occurring 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides are an important class of anticancer and antibacterial compounds. The direct glycosylation of phenols inevitably produces 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides, decreasing the efficiency of the synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides. Herein we report a novel one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides by the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction of 1&#8208;iodoglycals and phenols, followed by in situ reduction of the obtained ketene acetals with catecholborane. Starting from readily available materials, this protocol is applicable to a wide range of substrates, affording the corresponding 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl glycosides in high yields and with exclusive &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of various bioactive natural products or drugs. The remarkable stereoselectivity was rationalized by the experimental and theoretical studies.

         <title>Competitive Coordination Constructed Heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 Dual Single&#8208;Atom Sites for Selective Oxidation of Allylic Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual single&#8208;atom on hydroxyapatite via competitive coordination strtegy. Through exploiting periodic Ca2+ vacancies of HAP, high charge&#8208;density Pt4+ ions preferentially occupy these sites, creating charge imbalance that drives adjacent Fe2+ anchoring for compensation. Unexpectedly, Pt1&#8208;Fe1 orbital hybridization induces a spin&#8208;state transition, facilitating O2 activation and following cascade oxidation of allylic alcohol. This yields&#160;ultrahigh aldehyde selectivity (92%) and a high turnover frequency (12&#160;090.8&#160;h&#8722;1), 20&#8208;fold higher than Pt1/HAP single&#8208;atom catalyst. 








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their exceptional atom efficiency and synergistic catalytic effects. Nevertheless, establishing precise synthetic methodologies for DSACs and exploring its application in complex reaction systems still present significant challenges. Here, we have fabricated a hydroxyapatite (HAP)&#8208;supported heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt1&#8208;Fe1/HAP) via a competitive coordination strategy for selective oxidation of allylic alcohols. Through a thermodynamically driven competitive coordination process, heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 with distinct charge densities is co&#8208;anchored within adjacent periodic Ca2+ vacancies of HAP lattice via PO43&#8722; bridges, achieving a controlled atomic separation of &#8764;2.7&#160;&#197; for electronic synergy. Unexpectedly, orbital hybridization between heteronuclear Pt1&#8208;Fe1 induces a spin&#8208;state transition of Fe from low&#8208;spin to medium&#8208;spin, facilitating activation of O2 and following cascade oxidation of allylic alcohol. Benefiting from the modification of spin state, Pt1&#8208;Fe1/HAP exhibits ultrahigh aldehyde selectivity (92%) and a high turnover frequency (12&#160;090.8&#160;h&#8722;1) in oxidation of various allylic alcohol substrates, 20&#8208;fold higher than that of Pt1/HAP single&#8208;atom catalyst (543.8&#160;h&#8722;1). This work establishes the thermodynamically driven competitive coordination strategy as a universal approach for constructing high&#8208;performance heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts with precisely engineered electronic synergy in demanding industrial processes.

         <title>Switching the Reaction Pathway to the Oxide Path for High&#8208;Efficiency Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
Unlocking how 1D edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedra chains in model catalyst Ca2IrO4 drive adaptive coordination reconstruction, triggering a mechanistic transition from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). This transition stems from CV activation&#8208;induced edge&#8208;sharing reconstruction on the (001) surface, which achieves shortening of Ir&#9472;Ir bonds.








Abstract
Understanding dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationships in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains challenging due to electrocatalysts&#8217; structural complexity. Here, we employ Ca2IrO4&#8212;a model catalyst with exclusively edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedra forming 1D chains&#8212;to decode mechanistic evolution through synergistic interplay between corrosion&#8208;resistant (110) and electrochemically activable (001) facets. With low (110) and (001) facet ratios, Ca2IrO4 (L&#8208;H&#8208;CIO) undergoes electrochemical activation to form an adaptively reconstructed structure, ultimately achieving exceptional OER performance&#8212;demonstrating a low overpotential of 279&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 200&#8208;h stability without decay. The L&#8208;H&#8208;CIO&#8208;based PEMWE exhibits high electrocatalytic activity (1.78&#160;V @ 2.0 A cm&#8722;2, 80&#160;&#176;C, 0.11 mgIr cm&#8722;2) at ampere&#8208;level current densities while demonstrating sustained stability beyond 500&#160;h at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that adaptive surface reconstruction drives a mechanistic transition from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide path mechanism (OPM). This shift is structurally anchored by edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedra reconstruction (Ir&#8211;Ir 2.8&#160;&#197;) of the (001) surface, which simultaneously downshifts the Ir d&#8208;band center away from the Fermi level. The resultant weakened metal&#8208;intermediate covalency optimizes the adsorption&#8211;desorption equilibrium, conferring thermodynamic and kinetic advantages to OPM. Our work establishes adaptive coordination reconstruction as a universal strategy to engineer pre&#8208;catalysts that evolve into high&#8208;efficiency OER phases, providing a roadmap for next&#8208;generation catalyst design.

         <title>Successive Sulfur Oxidation Directs Topological Transformation From 41 Knot to 632$6_3^2$ Link</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, employing S&#8208;center as the molecular trigger, we successfully achieved the transformation from octanuclear&#160;41&#8197;metallic knot to dodecanuclear 632$6_3^2$ metallic links via the stepwise oxidation strategy, which represents an important example of realizing topological structural complexity and also provides the new insights for the design of responsive materials.








Abstract
Achieving transformation between different types of topologies remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, sulfur oxidation was utilized as the stimuli to trigger topological transformations from knots to links. The process began with a thioether&#8208;type precursor, M (41 metallic knot), which was synthesized by self&#8208;assembling the sulfur&#8208;bridged ligand L with building block B in high yield. Following oxidation reactions, we successfully transformed the octanuclear 41 metallic knot (M) with four crossing points into a sulfoxide&#8208;type dodecanuclear 632$6_3^2$ metallic link (M&#8208;O) with six crossing points as an intermediate product, and then to a sulfone&#8208;type dodecanuclear 632$6_3^2$ metallic link (M&#8208;2O) with six crossing points, which achieves a dual leap in both metal nuclearity and crossing complexity. Remarkably, the key to the transformation lies in using the embedded S&#8208;centres of M as molecular triggers and stepwise oxidation (&#8208;S&#8208;&#8594;&#8208;S(O)&#8208;&#8594;&#8208;S(O)2&#8208;) enabled precise modulation of the geometric configuration of the sp3 S&#8208;centres, drastically altering the range of accessible coordination vectors and inducing conformational self&#8208;adaptation among components. This strategy establishes a novel oxidation&#8208;mediated interconversion paradigm among complex topologies, offering new insights for designing dynamic molecular triggers in intelligent material systems.

         <title>Operando Insights into Bridging Oxygen&#8208;Driven RuOx Lattice Collapse and its Mitigation Strategy for Durable Industrial PEMWE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A device&#8208;level diagnostic study reveals that RuOx anodes in PEMWE suffer from irreversible loss of bridging oxygen (Obridge), leading to deactivation. The Ru&#8211;O stabilization strategy was proposed by low&#8208;level Ir doping to suppress Obridge loss, which maintains stable ampere&#8208;level operation. This work links atomic&#8208;scale structural dynamics to performance loss, which establishes a new paradigm for diagnosing under real PEMWE conditions.








Abstract
Ruthenium oxide (RuOx) is a promising anode catalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but its degradation mechanism, especially under practical ampere&#8208;level operation, remains elusive. Herein, we established a device&#8208;level diagnostic framework to investigate the evolution of RuOx. Operando PEMWE&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed a progressive negative shift of the Ru K&#8208;edge. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis further showed a pronounced decrease in both Ru&#8211;O and Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ru coordination, revealing that irreversible loss of bridging oxygen (Obridge) triggers the final catalyst deactivation. Guided by these insights, we demonstrated that low&#8208;level Ir doping in Ru0.9Ir0.1Ox could notably increase the Obridge vacancy formation energy and thus stabilize the Ru&#8211;O framework. Under identical PEMWE operating conditions, the Ru valence state and coordination environment in Ru0.9Ir0.1Ox remain relatively stable. In&#8208;cell electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analyses confirmed that this structural stabilization strategy effectively maintains low electrode kinetic and proton transport resistances across a range of cell voltages, enabling stable operation at industrially relevant ampere&#8208;level current densities. Finally, the resulting Ru0.9Ir0.1Ox catalyst achieves 1.74&#160;V at 3 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500 h at 1 A&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming most reported Ru&#8208;based anodes.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; could notably increase the O&lt;sub&gt;bridge&lt;/sub&gt; vacancy formation energy and thus stabilize the Ru&#8211;O framework. Under identical PEMWE operating conditions, the Ru valence state and coordination environment in Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; remain relatively stable. In-cell electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analyses confirmed that this structural stabilization strategy effectively maintains low electrode kinetic and proton transport resistances across a range of cell voltages, enabling stable operation at industrially relevant ampere-level current densities. Finally, the resulting Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; catalyst achieves 1.74&#160;V at 3 A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stably operates for 500 h at 1 A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming most reported Ru-based anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quaternary Carbon Centers via Electrochemical Direct Dehydroxylative Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a modular electrochemical strategy for the direct dehydroxylative alkylation of tertiary alcohols via a polar&#8208;to&#8208;radical transduction mechanism. This unified activation platform enables C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond formation with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and benzyl chlorides, employing readily available reagents under mild, operationally simple conditions.








Abstract
The construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a formidable challenge in organic synthesis due to the steric congestion and limited accessibility of suitable precursors. Herein, we report a modular electrochemical strategy for the direct dehydroxylative alkylation of tertiary alcohols via a polar&#8208;to&#8208;radical transduction mechanism. This unified activation platform enables C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond formation with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and benzyl chlorides, employing readily available reagents under mild, operationally simple conditions. Key to this transformation is the use of halide&#8208;based reagents that mediate Lewis acid&#8208;promoted C&#9472;OH bond cleavage while enabling subsequent radical generation via cathodic reduction. The method exhibits broad substrate scope, including complex and functionalized tertiary alcohols, diverse Michael acceptors, and sterically hindered coupling partners. It is further applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules and scalable synthesis. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of both carbocation and carbon radical intermediates, validating the effectiveness of this dual&#8208;mode strategy. This work provides a general and practical approach to quaternary carbon construction from unactivated tertiary alcohols, expanding the synthetic toolbox for C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond formation.

         <title>Tuning the Circularly Polarized Reflection from Cholesteric Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Using Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular photoswitches dispersed in a cholesteric hydroxypropyl cellulose mesophase enable reversible, light&#8208;driven tuning of structural color and polarization. Enantiomer&#8208;specific effects and light&#8208;responsive patterning highlight the potential of dynamic, cellulose&#8208;based photonic materials.








Abstract
Controlling the ordering of molecular liquid crystals using light has found widespread applications in reflectors, sensors, and tunable optical filters. In chiral liquid crystals such as cholesterics, introducing a molecular switch can alter chiral interactions between mesogens and thus affect the periodicity and photonic band responsible for the structural color of the material. However, analogous photo&#8208;control of cellulose&#8208;based cholesteric polymers has not been reported. Here, we investigate the addition of achiral and chiral switches to cholesteric mesophases of structurally colored hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and monitor changes in the photonic bandgap upon varying concentration, illumination, or temperature. While an achiral photoswitch enables reversible tuning of the reflected color upon trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization, chiral switches (with different pendant groups and R/S enantiomers) lead to substantial differences in pitch and polarized reflection during cycles of illumination or heating/cooling&#8211;attributed to the complex interplay between the chiralities of the switch and of the host mesophase. A final combination of chiral photoswitch and spiropyran enables independent control of reflected and transmitted color, which can be relevant for cellulose&#8208;based photonic displays, smart labels, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure [3]Cyclorubicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a high yielding synthesis of enantiopure [3]cyclorubicene, which is a potential precursor for a Haeckelite nanotube. This macrocycle was studied for its electronic and chiroptical properties and exhibits one of the highest dissymmetry values reported for a nanohoop. 








Abstract
The interest in chiral nanohoops and nanotubes as well as their chiroptical properties has steadily increased in recent years. The synthesis of pentagon containing enantiopure [3]cyclorubicenes, which are cutouts and potential precursors of chiral Haeckelite nanotubes is presented, based on enantiopure &#8220;corner units&#8221;. The resulting enantiopure nanohoops were studied for their electronic and chiroptical properties with one of the highest dissymmetry values reported for CPPs of up to 2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2.

         <title>Electrostatic Landscape Design for Ionomer Adhesion and Poison&#8208;Resistant Platinum Catalysis in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered electrostatic landscape on F, N&#8208;doped nanocarbons harnesses strong ionomer&#8208;support adhesion to mitigate Pt site poisoning. This strategy creates an optimal Pt&#8208;ionomer interface, boosting active site accessibility and mass transport, ultimately leading to exceptional fuel cell performance and durability.








Abstract
Uneven ionomer distribution and sulfonate groups (&#8211;SO3&#8211;) poisoning at platinum (Pt) sites significantly impede Pt utilization and local mass transport in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report an electrostatic landscape design on nanocarbon supports that harnesses strong and uniform ionomer adhesion to create a poison&#8208;resistant Pt interface, effectively mitigating direct poisoning of Pt sites by &#8211;SO3&#8211; groups and enhancing active sites accessibility and local mass transport. The resulting PtFe/FN&#8208;C catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low ionomer coverage of only 6.4%, enabling a peak power density of 1.39&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and an oxygen transport resistance of only 44.5&#160;s m&#8722;1 in PEMFC testing. Furthermore, it demonstrates impressive durability, with only a 2&#160;mV voltage loss after 30 000 cycles at 0.8&#160;A cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a new principle for interface engineering where overall polymer&#8208;support adhesion governs local catalyst&#8208;functional group interactions, offering a general strategy for designing high&#8208;performance, poison&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Zn, S Dual Vacancies in Zn3In2S6 Inducing Local Orientated Electrical Field for Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial confinement strategy combining cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) embedding and H2 annealing was presented to precisely regulate Zn and S vacancies in Zn3In2S6 for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The optimal VZn:VS ratio of 1.0:1.9 can generate a robust local orientated electrical field (LOEF). It achieves a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 11580.74&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 through oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) pathways.








Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis attracts interest for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion but suffers from low carrier utilization and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we present a confinement strategy to precisely regulate Zn and S vacancies (VZn, VS) in Zn3In2S6 for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. ZnSO4, InCl3, thioacetamide, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were utilized to synthesize Zn3In2S6 via a hydrothermal process, in which CTAB inserts into anionic layers and forms covalent bonds with Zn2+ ions, then pyrolyzes and removes Zn2+ ions during the annealing process, inducing VZn formation. H2&#8208;mediated desulfurization generates VS. The contents of VZn and VS in Zn3In2S6 of 1.9:1.0, 1.1:1.0, 1.0:1.9, and 1.0:3.3 were obtained by adjusting the temperature. VS&amp;VZn&#8208;Zn3In2S6 (1.0:1.9) exhibits a fantastic photocatalytic generation rate of 11580.74&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for H2O2 which increased 2.4 times compared with VS&#8208;Zn3In2S6, attributing to that dual vacancies promote the local orientated electrical field (LOEF) formation and increase photogenerated&#8208;electron transfer from VS to VZn. Electrons delocalize onto adjacent Zn sites, promoting the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Simultaneously, VZn facilitates the migration of h&#8314; to the catalyst surface, thereby increasing h&#8314; utilization efficiency and accelerating the water oxidation reaction (WOR) process toward H2O2 production. VS&amp;VCu&#8208;CuIn2S4 and VS&amp;VNi&#8208;NiIn2S4 were successfully synthesized, highlighting its broad applicability as a general approach.

Extreme&#8208;Temperature and Fast&#8208;Charging LFP/graphite Batteries: A sterically hindered weak&#8208;solvation ether electrolyte suppresses graphite co&#8208;intercalation and accelerates Li&#8314; desolvation via ultralow freezing point (&#8722;117.67&#160;&#176;C) and tailored solvation structure. Engineered LiF/Li3N/Li2O/Li2CO3&#8208;rich interphases enable rapid interfacial transport and extreme&#8208;temperature resilience.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes are extensively utilized for energy storage applications because of their exceptional cycle life and inherent safety characteristics. However, sluggish desolvation kinetics and interfacial Li&#8314; transport hinder their fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance, limiting broader applications. In this work, we propose a weakly solvating ether (WSE) electrolyte based on 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrahydrofuran (2MT) as the main solvent. This electrolyte results in considerable steric hindrance, effectively preventing co&#8208;intercalation with Gr, while also providing a weak solvation capability for Li&#8314; ions and facilitating rapid interfacial Li&#8314; transport. WSE, formulated with 2MT and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as a co&#8208;solvent, combines fast desolvation kinetics with an extremely low freezing point of&#160;&#8722;117.67&#160;&#176;C. This electrolyte induces the formation of a LiF&#8208;, Li3N&#8208;, Li2CO3&#8208;, and Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Gr anode, thereby enhancing low&#8208;temperature interfacial transport. Consequently, the Gr||Li half&#8208;cell and the LFP||Gr full cell with this WSE demonstrates excellent rate performance, stable cycling stability, and a high specific capacity at&#160;&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C while also delivering reliable power even at&#160;&#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. These results underscore the electrolyte's efficient desolvation process, stable SEI layer, and excellent compatibility with graphite, rendering it ideal for extreme&#8208;temperature applications.

By accelerating the transition from a localized excited (LE) state to a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state via cascade methods of acceptor engineering and aggregated architecture optimization, an 808&#160;nm laser excitable multifunctional phototheranostic agent 6TP&#8208;IH was developed that shows 15.6&#8208;, 2.21&#8208;, and 3.18&#8208;fold improvements in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence intensity, &#8226;OH and 1O2 generation efficiencies, respectively. Consequently, it exhibits a very high tumor inhibition rate of 99.1% in phototheranostics. 








Abstract
Phototheranostic agents with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation wavelengths offer significant promise for tumor imaging and therapy. However, due to the limitations imposed by the energy gap law, such agents tend to generate heat while exhibiting limited photosensitization effects and fluorescence intensity, which hampers their combination therapy efficacy. Herein, we present an effective strategy of &#8220;acceleration of charge&#8208;separated&#8208;state formation&#8221; to simultaneously enhance NIR&#8208;II emission, type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photosensitization efficiencies of NIR excitable phototheranostic agents. Specifically, following the optimization of the chemical structure and aggregated architecture, the rate of transition from localized excited (LE) state to charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is improved from 1.19&#160;&#215;&#160;109&#160;s&#8722;1 (in toluene) and 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;s&#8722;1 (in water) for 8TP&#8208;IF to 4.69&#160;&#215;&#160;109&#160;s&#8722;1 (in toluene) and 1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;s&#8722;1 (in water) for 6TP&#8208;IH. As a consequence, upon NIR 808&#160;nm excitation, the fluorescence, &#8226;OH and 1O2 generation efficiencies of 6TP&#8208;IH are improved to 15.6, 2.21, and 3.38 times to those of 8TP&#8208;IF. Encapsulation of 6TP&#8208;IH into nanoparticles (NPs) enables their application in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence image&#8208;guided tumor combination therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirm the precise tumor imaging capability of 6TP&#8208;IH NPs, along with robust tumor ablation and effective activation of tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) through synergistic photodynamic and photothermal therapy. These effects collectively yield an impressive tumor inhibition rate of 99.1% in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.

This autonomous paradigm leverages the inherent chemical energy of wastewater, thereby eliminating chemical additives and reducing energy consumption compared to conventional UV&#8208; or electrochemical&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Conventional catalytic water purification remains energy&#8208; and chemical&#8208;intensive due to reliance on external stimuli for oxidant activation. Here, we present a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic membrane (TMF&#8208;CM) incorporating Ti&#8208;doped Mn3O4/Fe3O4 catalysts with engineered oxygen vacancies, which harness pollutants as electron donors to drive enzyme&#8208;mimetic redox cycles. Through nanoconfinement within ceramic membrane pores, dissolved oxygen is autonomously activated by electrons derived from contaminants, enabling continuous regeneration of active sites without chemical additives. Mechanistic investigations, supported by spectroscopic and computational evidence, reveal that high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo intermediates mediate contaminant oxidation while concurrently restoring oxygen vacancies, thereby sustaining catalytic cycles. During 10&#8208;day continuous testing in real wastewater, the TMF&#8208;CM system achieved over 90.1% contaminant removal and exhibited self&#8208;cleaning capability. This autonomous catalytic paradigm leverages the inherent chemical energy of wastewater, eliminating chemical additives and cutting energy consumption by 70%&#8211;98% compared to UV&#8208; or electrochemical&#8208;based systems. By integrating molecular oxygen activation with circular electron transfer, we establish a sustainable oxidation strategy that extends beyond conventional water treatment paradigms.

         <title>Photoinduced Proton&#8208;Cation Cascade Boosting Ion Intercalation Dynamics in Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries exhibit remarkable performance under illumination. However, a fundamental mechanistic gap persists in understanding light&#8208;enhanced battery performance, as existing theories fail to explain the complex interplay between photoexcitation and ion intercalation dynamics. Here, photoinduced proton&#8208;cation cascade reveals the link between photoexcitation and cation intercalation kinetics in atomic&#8208;scale.








Abstract
While photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries represent a promising energy storage frontier&#8212;with light irradiation significantly improving performance&#8212;their development remains hindered by a fundamental knowledge gap, as existing theories struggle to fully account for improved light&#8208;driven ion intercalation. This work discovers the photoinduced proton&#8208;zinc ion intercalation cascade mechanism, establishing a theoretical framework that explains the synergistic proton&#8208;cation interplay and its role in capacity enhancement under illumination. Through light&#8208;induced charge transfer, photogenerated electrons drive proton intercalation, which induces the deprotonation of Zn2+&#8208;coordinated water molecules due to the limited availability of free protons in the electrolyte. This deprotonation is energetically favored because of the lower deprotonation barrier of Zn2+&#8208;coordinated water compared to uncoordinated water, thereby accelerating zinc&#8208;ion desolvation and promoting Zn2+ intercalation. Consequently, the synergistic H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;intercalation enables an exceptional areal capacity of 12.86&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 under illumination in a photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;ion battery with a high mass&#8208;loading of 30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work elucidates a proton&#8208;cation cascade mechanism that governs light&#8208;driven intercalation dynamics, providing the missing link between photo&#8208;excitation and enhanced battery performance.

         <title>Gas&#8211;Proton Microenvironment Modulation for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;wettability Bi&#8211;PVDF catalyst with spatially encoded superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic nanodomains enables the decoupling of CO2 and proton transport at the triple&#8208;phase interface, promoting selective *OCHO intermediate stabilization and high&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion under industrially relevant current densities.








Abstract
Precise control of interfacial water structure is essential for suppressing side reactions and enabling selective CO2 electroreduction at industrial current densities. Here, we synthesize a series of bismuth&#8208;based catalysts with spatially encoded superhydrophilic&#8211;superhydrophobic nanodomains by partially embedding polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) into Bi nanoparticles. This strategy creates interfacial polarity patterns that stabilize *OCHO intermediates while suppressing hydrogen and CO evolution. Compared to the PVDF&#8208;free control, the optimized Bi&#8211;PVDF catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced formate partial current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and long&#8208;term stability. It achieves&#160;&gt;&#160;90% FE at &#8722;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 50&#160;h and maintains high selectivity up to &#8722;700&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando spectroscopy and multiscale simulations reveal that the dual&#8208;wettability interface modulates local hydration and charge distribution, promoting selective intermediate formation while kinetically suppressing side pathways. By addressing the longstanding challenge of coupled gas&#8211;proton transport, this work offers a mechanism&#8208;driven and scalable strategy to construct interfacial microenvironments for high&#8208;rate, selective CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Cluster Formation and Phase Transitions Induced by Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>

Non &#8208; resonant Rayleigh scattering reveals that vibrational strong coupling induces clustering and phase transitions in liquids that undergo well defined transitions with temperature and solvent composition.








Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has been shown to significantly modify the chemical and physical properties of molecules and materials. Here we report the non&#8208;resonant Rayleigh scattering of various molecules in liquid phase, such as toluene and water, and find that it is enhanced by ca. two orders of magnitude in the visible upon VSC of vibrational bands of the solvent in the infrared (IR). The results show that the enhanced scattering is due to the formation of new phase possibly consisting of clusters. The VSC phase undergoes a well&#8208;defined transition with temperature and solvent composition. This finding has significant consequences for understanding how VSC influences molecular processes such as chemical reactivity and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>A Zinc Solvation&#8208;Tailored Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A novel water&#8208;free deep eutectic electrolyte (DES) featuring a unique Zn2+ solvation structure effectively suppresses parasitic reactions and dendrites, enabling high&#8208;efficiency zinc plating/stripping and remarkable full&#8208;cell cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are gaining attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, their performance is fundamentally limited by parasitic reactions such as hydrogen evolution (HER), dendrite growth, and surface passivation, which result from the high reactivity of water. In this study, we report a novel nonhydrated deep eutectic electrolyte (DES), termed OUD&#8208;122, formulated from Zn(OTf)2, urea, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 1:2:2 molar ratio. In this ternary system, DMSO acts as a coordinating ligand to Zn2+, resulting in a well&#8208;defined solvation structure and an extended hydrogen&#8208;bond network among Zn(OTf)2, urea, and DMSO. This coordination environment effectively suppresses parasitic reactions, prevents byproduct accumulation and electrode corrosion, and significantly expands the electrochemical stability window. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cell exhibits exceptional lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h without short&#8208;circuiting, while Zn||Cu asymmetric cells maintain an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4% over 400 cycles. Furthermore, Zn||Prussian Blue full cells deliver a discharge capacity of 82.5&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 over 5000 cycles at room temperature and maintain 89.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles at 50&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating robust electrochemical performance and thermal resilience.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Nanodomains Regulation for Optimized Ionic Translocation Enabling High&#8208;Voltage and Practical Utility Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite polymer electrolyte featuring dual&#8208;domain&#8208;coupled secondary nanoconfinement is constructed via precise polymer&#8211;nanodomain engineering. The mesoporous framework and dynamic polymer segments form interconnected ion pathways. In addition, anchoring domains with high negative surface potentials preload Li+, enhancing ion density and conductivity. 








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (HVSSLMBs) integrate high&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) with lithium metal anodes, offering great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, high&#8208;voltage charging induces lattice oxygen oxidation at the cathode, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that degrade inorganic solid electrolytes. In addition, the low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and limited electrochemical stability of polymer electrolytes hinder their application with HVCs. Here, we design a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with dual&#8208;domain&#8208;coupled secondary nanoconfinement via precise polymer&#8211;nanodomain engineering. This structure combines a mesoporous framework with dynamic segmental motion, forming interconnected ion channels between free and anchored domains. The anchoring domains with high negative surface potential preload lithium ions, thereby increasing the local ion density and promoting a continuous high&#8208;conductance path. Benefiting from the protection mechanism of the nanoconfined system, the chemical stability of the polymer is greatly improved, thus achieving operation at high voltage. Cells paired with 4.8&#160;V LRMO (Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2) retained 80.37% capacity after 200 cycles. Notably, this study reported the first&#8208;ever assembly of a large&#8208;format pouch cell combining a CPE with the LRMO cathode, delivering an impressive energy density of 419.47&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a capacity of 4.61 Ah. This advancement marks a significant milestone in the application of HVSSLMBs.

         <title>The Methylbismuth Dication: Pentagonal Pyramidal Coordination and Ligand&#8208;Induced Lewis Superacidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simplistic methylbismuth dication has been captured only by the aid of monodentate tetrahydrofuran (thf) ligands, [BiMe(thf)5]2+. The hexacoordinate species shows a very unusual pentagonal pyramidal coordination geometry. Unparalleled Lewis acidic and Lewis superacidic properties have been revealed by exploiting the coordination chemical properties of the &#8220;BiMe2+&#8221; complex fragment and the substitutional lability of the thf ligands.








Abstract
A profound understanding of the naturally preferred coordination geometry of molecular complexes is the basis for scientists to rationalize, predict, and design their physico&#8208;chemical properties and reactivity. Gaining access to compounds with an unusual coordination chemistry and developing a fundamental knowledge about their properties represent key challenges in the field. Tackling these questions promises an entry to unexplored chemical space and reactivity patterns that are inaccessible for compounds found in more traditional coordination geometries. Here, we present the synthesis, isolation, and characterization of the simplest organobismuth dication, the methylbismuth dication [BiMe(thf)5][SbF6]2 (1), stabilized only by five substitutionally labile THF ligands. The hexa&#8208;coordinate compound shows a rare pentagonal pyramidal coordination geometry around the central atom, which is extremely unusual given the fact that this is an organometallic species with only simple monodentate monoanionic and/or neutral ligands without considerable steric bulk. The detailed investigation of this compound with experimental and theoretical approaches reveals the cause of the unusual coordination chemistry and uncovers multiple Lewis acidic binding sites and ligand&#8208;induced Lewis superacidity.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Dinitrile from Nylon&#8208;66&#8208;Derived Diamine Enabled by Highly Active Mn&#8211;O&#8211;Co Motifs in Spinel Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spinel electrocatalyst with active Mn&#8211;O&#8211;Co motifs was synthesized to selectively steer the conversion nylon&#8208;66&#8208;derived hexamethylenediamine (HMD) to value&#8208;added adiponitrile (ADN). The Co sites dominate hydroxyl species adsorption, while the Mn sites facilitate HMD activation, synergistically enabling a high Faradaic efficiency of 93% for ADN production.








Abstract
Conventional industrial production of adiponitrile (ADN), a critical building block in energy storage devices and polymer manufacturing, is predominately achieved via butadiene hydrocyanation. However, this method suffers from harsh energy demand and reliance on highly toxic hydrogen cyanide, thereby posing significant environmental and safety concerns. Herein, we developed a sustainable electroreforming strategy for ADN synthesis from waste nylon&#8208;66 using Mn doped Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) catalyst. Mn doping strategy endows Co3O4 with enhanced activity toward electrooxidation of nylon&#8208;66&#8208;derived hexamethylenediamine (HMD). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the selective incorporation of Mn into octahedral Co3+ sites creates highly active Mn&#8211;O&#8211;Co motifs, which concurrently enables HMD adsorption at Mn sites and the formation of reactive hydroxyl species at Co sites. Such a synergistic interaction between Mn and Co sites promotes N&#9472;H bond activation, enabling Mn&#8211;Co3O4 to achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of ADN (93%) at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a yield rate of 0.87&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, our study demonstrates a scalable route to generate high&#8208;purity ADN from end&#8208;of&#8208;life cable ties through acidic hydrolysis treatment followed by two&#8208;electrode electrolysis, achieving an overall yield of 95%. This work offers a sustainable approach for ADN electrosynthesis from waste plastics leveraging renewable electricity.

         <title>Structural Effects in Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Assemblies for Enhanced Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular proton conductor (BPN) is constructed via charge&#8208;assisted dynamic hydrogen bonding between POMs and [Bi6O5(OH)3] clusters, enabling ultrahigh proton conductivity (0.12&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C, 97% RH). 1H MAS NMR demonstrates that protons at Bi&#8211;O sites exhibit twofold shorter spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1) than those at W&#8208;O sites, confirming heterogeneous mobility. BPN&#8208;Nafion hybrid membranes boost DMFC performance (86&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 59.3% higher than pristine Nafion) with a high OCV (0.82 V).








Abstract
Proton conductors with engineered charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks are pivotal for advancing proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, a novel proton&#8208;conducting supramolecular clusters, ([Bi6O5 (OH)3]2.24[PW12O40]1[NO3]2.4[H3O]5.8, BPN) has been synthesized and characterized. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that charge&#8208;assisted dynamic O&#9472;H&#8943;O hydrogen bonds mediate the supramolecular assembly, while water molecules facilitate proton transport pathways. The material exhibits a maximum proton conductivity of 0.12&#160;S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C and 97% (RH) relative humidity, which is comparable to that of Nafion. The spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time (T1) of the Bi&#8211;O adsorbed protons is significantly shorter than that of the W&#8208;O adsorbed protons, indicating that the protons at the Bi&#8211;O sites have a higher migration rate. 1H magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR (1H MAS NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal [Bi6O8] enhances proton mobility, while [PW12O40] stabilizes transition states, lowering the activation barrier to 0.14&#160;eV. The BPN&#8208;Nafion hybrid membrane enhances direct methanol fuel cell performance with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.82&#160;V and power density of 86&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This integrative design strategy&#8212;synergizing inorganic cluster units with dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks&#8212;establishes a scalable platform for developing PEMFC materials with programmable proton transport pathways and improved operational stability.

Herein, a novel proton-conducting supramolecular clusters, ([Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2.24&lt;/sub&gt;[PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2.4&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sub&gt;5.8&lt;/sub&gt;, BPN) has been synthesized and characterized. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that charge-assisted dynamic O&#9472;H&#8943;O hydrogen bonds mediate the supramolecular assembly, while water molecules facilitate proton transport pathways. The material exhibits a maximum proton conductivity of 0.12&#160;S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;&#176;C and 97% (RH) relative humidity, which is comparable to that of Nafion. The spin-lattice relaxation time (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of the Bi&#8211;O adsorbed protons is significantly shorter than that of the W-O adsorbed protons, indicating that the protons at the Bi&#8211;O sites have a higher migration rate. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magic-angle spinning NMR (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H MAS NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal [Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;] enhances proton mobility, while [PW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;] stabilizes transition states, lowering the activation barrier to 0.14&#160;eV. The BPN-Nafion hybrid membrane enhances direct methanol fuel cell performance with an open-circuit voltage of 0.82&#160;V and power density of 86&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This integrative design strategy&#8212;synergizing inorganic cluster units with dynamic hydrogen-bonding networks&#8212;establishes a scalable platform for developing PEMFC materials with programmable proton transport pathways and improved operational stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Deacylative Mizoroki&#8211;Heck Reaction of Unstrained Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent deacylative Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction for preparing a large variety of alkyl&#8208;tethered alkenes from methyl ketones and cyclic ketones under dual Co/photoredox catalysis has been developed. This protocol features a one&#8208;pot reaction, high ring&#8208;opening efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group compatibility.








Abstract
Alkene structures represent one of the most functional and widely used in organic synthesis, drug design, and material science. However, developing a practical strategy to produce such high&#8208;valued chemicals from widely abundant materials, such as ketones, remains elusive. Herein, we present a stereodivergent deacylative Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction of methyl ketones and cyclic ketones to furnish both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;configured alkenes via dual photoredox/cobalt catalysis. Interestingly, the tunable E/Z&#8208;selectivity is achieved by energy transfer catalysis via the judicious choice of photocatalyst. This versatile strategy features a broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance and is suitable for late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and the one&#8208;pot operation. It also expands the reaction profiles of both deacylative transformation and photoredox/cobalt catalysis.

         <title>Aquatic Environment Breaks the Size Confinement of the TiO2 Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 exhibits an independent size effect in an aqueous environment, mitigating the mechanical fracture associated with submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 particles. This novel aqueous interface regulation enhances the surface energy of submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 anode, thereby increasing their robustness in aqueous battery systems. The submicron TiO2 can be scaled up into an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. The pouch cell can achieve a high energy density of 66&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (217&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) with superior electrochemical performance of 1200 cycles.








Abstract
The particle size of TiO2 anodes is commonly believed to have a negative impact on their mechanical properties. As submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 exhibits low surface energy, which reduces yield strength and leads to mechanical fracture during the two&#8208;phase lithium storage mechanism, it is excluded from traditional nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, we discovered that TiO2 demonstrates an independent size effect in an aqueous environment, mitigating the mechanical fracture associated with submicron&#8208;sized TiO2. Our studies reveal that water molecules strongly interact with submicron TiO2 materials, increasing the surface energy in aqueous electrolytes in a unique manner. This enhancement makes submicron TiO2 more resilient during the lithiation and de&#8208;lithiation reactions. Additionally, the transition from nano to submicron TiO2 facilitates the inhibition of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in aqueous batteries and enhances the performance of electrode coatings. Consequently, submicron TiO2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance in aqueous batteries, with an Ah&#8208;level pouch battery achieving an energy density of 66&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (217&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) and demonstrating excellent cycling stability of over 1200 cycles. Our work has successfully addressed the size limitations of the TiO2 anodes, offering an innovative perspective on micro&#8208;sized electrode materials previously considered unsuitable for battery use.

         <dc:description>
Molecular solar thermal storage (MOST) systems have recently regained great interest after a period of intense research around five decades ago. This perspective clarifies the nomenclature, and introduces the term &#8220;mostophore&#8221; for molecular entities that harvest and store light energy as heat. It revisits practical system requirements and provides a historical perspective with future prospects. 








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal storage (MOST) systems have gained increasing attention in the past years after an intense initial exploration phase around five decades ago. Over time multiple terms have been circulating in the literature, such as solar thermal fuels or solar thermal batteries. Besides clarifying the nomenclature, we introduce the term &#8220;mostophore&#8221; as a molecular entity able to harvest and store light energy in the form of heat. Furthermore, we revisit the requirements for practical systems and put the concept in a historic perspective with a future outlook.

         <title>Halide Bond Assisted Double Desymmetrization of Meso&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acids with Symmetrical Olefins via Asymmetric Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a double desymmetrization of meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acids with symmetrical olefins, constructing complex chiral lactones with six stereocenters in one step. Unexpectedly, the halide bond was found to be crucial in achieving high stereoselectivity. This method enables the formal synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;longifolene and provides a versatile platform for accessing valuable terpenoid and norbornane&#8208;based natural products.








Abstract
The efficient synthesis of complex chiral molecules from achiral precursors is essential for sustainable pharmaceutical development. Among available strategies, the desymmetrization of meso compounds provides a powerful route to construct multiple stereocenters in a single step. Although meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acids are promising feedstocks, their catalytic asymmetric desymmetrization remains a significant challenge. Herein we report a catalytic asymmetric halolactonization of meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acids with electronically unbiased olefins, achieving simultaneous desymmetrization of both the meso&#8208;dicarboxylic acid and haliranium intermediate. This method efficiently constructs chiral caged polycyclic lactones bearing six stereocenters in a single operation. Furthermore, the reaction is extended to exocyclic olefins, granting access to valuable terpenoid scaffolds. Its synthetic utility is highlighted by the enantioselective formal synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;longifolene, establishing a versatile platform for accessing norbornane&#8208;based natural products. Mechanistic studies reveal that the brominated amino&#8208;urea catalyst operates as a biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonding activator. Unexpectedly, the bromine substituent on the catalysts functions as an unconventional Br&#248;nsted base to stabilize a key intermediate via halide bond instead of a typical halogen bond. This work marks a substantial advancement in terpenoid synthesis, merging operational simplicity with the efficient generation of multiple stereocenters in a single transformation.

         <title>Modulating Li+ and Polysulfide Solvation with Low&#8208;Density Moderately Solvating Electrolytes for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

A low&#8208;density, nonfluorinated moderately solvating electrolyte (MSE) composed of methyl tert&#8211;butyl ether concurrently tunes Li+ and polysulfide solvation, lowering desolvation barrier and mitigating polysulfide shuttling. It effectively stabilizes both electrodes and enables stable cycling of Li&#8211;S batteries under practical parameters at room temperature and 45&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries show great promise as the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, yet they still suffer from polysulfide shuttling and interphasial instability. Electrolyte, as the medium for ion transport and sulfur conversion, plays a crucial role in overcoming these challenges. Here, we introduce a moderately solvating electrolyte (MSE) based on low&#8208;density, low&#8208;viscosity, and nonfluorinated ether co&#8208;solvents that balances polysulfide suppression, Li metal stabilization, and redox kinetics. Through multiple solvent&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8208;ion interactions, the optimized MSE weakens Li+&#8208;solvent pairing while strengthening cation&#8211;anion interactions, thereby lowering the desolvation barrier and promoting the formation of a favorable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Meanwhile, MSE limits the polysulfide dissolution but improves the accessibility of active material through better wettability and tailored solvation environment, leading to an altered sulfur deposition mechanism with &#946; &#8211; &#945; conversion. This approach enables a stable cycling of high&#8208;mass loading Li&#8211;S cells (&gt; 3.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) at both room temperature and 45&#160;&#176;C (where shuttling and side reactions are severer), and demonstrates a pouch cell with lean electrolyte content (4.5&#160;&#181;L mg s&#8722;1). This work highlights a practical route to develop high&#8208;performance electrolyte for Li&#8211;S cells and provides mechanistic insights into their operation.
