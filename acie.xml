         <title>Electrohydrogenation of Nitriles with Amines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles represents an efficient and sustainable one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable bulk and fine chemicals. We report herein a molecular cobalt electrocatalyst for selective hydrogenative coupling of nitriles with amines using protons as the hydrogen source. The key to success for this reductive reaction is the use of an electrocatalytic approach for efficient cobalt&#8208;hydride generation through a sequence of cathodic reduction and protonation. As only electrons (e&#8208;) and protons (H+) as the redox equivalent and hydrogen source, this general electrohydrogenation protocol is showcased by highly selective and straightforward synthesis of various functionalized and structurally diverse amines, as well as deuterium isotope labeling applications. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electrogenerated cobalt&#8208;hydride transfer to nitrile process is the rate&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been achieved, giving a series of 1,2&#8208;diborylaryl lithium species in excellent yields under mild reaction conditions, which leads to 1,2&#8208;di(tolyl)borylarenes in 60%&#8208;91% yields upon treatment with the hydride&#8208;abstracting reagent. In these transformations, one sp2 C&#8208;H of arene is activated and both boryl units are utilized to build two new (sp2)C&#8208;B bonds. This represents a new strategy for selective arene diborylation. DFT calculations suggest that an aromatic nucleophilic substitution is a key step in the formation of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Electroreduction of Nitric Oxide to Ammonia at Low Concentration via Vacancy Engineered FeOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous electroreduction of nitric oxide (NO) to NH3 (NORR) has gained extensive attention for the sake of low carbon emission and air pollutant treatment. Unfortunately, NORR is greatly hindered by its sluggish kinetics on the electrode, especially under low concentrations of NO. Herein, we developed a chlorine (Cl) vacancy strategy to overcome this limitation over FeOCl nanosheets (FeOCl&#8208;VCl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Cl vacancy resulted in defective Fe with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics in FeOCl&#8208;VCl to enhance the absorption and activation of NO, enabling the conversion of NO to NH3 at low concentration. In situ XANES and ATR&#8208;IR&#160;were carried out to verify the lower average oxidation state of defective Fe to enhance the electron transfer for NO adsorption/activation and facilitate the generation of key NHO and NHx intermediates. As a result, the FeOCl&#8208;VCl exhibited superior NORR activities with the NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 91.1% while maintaining a high NH3 yield rate of 455.4 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 under 1.0 vol% low NO concentration, very competitive with those of previously reported catalytic systems under higher NO concentration. Further, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery utilizing FeOCl&#8208;VCl as cathode delivered a record peak power density of 6.2 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208; Hydroarylation(alkenylation) of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access &#8208;CF2H Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An emerging class of C&#8208;C coupling transformations that furnish drug&#8208;like building blocks involves catalytic hydrocarbonation of alkenes. However, despite notable advances in the field, hydrocarbon addition to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes without additional electronic activation remains largely unsuccessful. This owes partly to poor reactivity and the propensity of difluoroalkenes to undergo defluorinative side reactions. Here, we report a nickel catalytic system that promotes efficient 1,2&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation, suppressing defluorination and providing straightforward access to a diverse assortment of prized organofluorides bearing difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted carbon centers. In contrast to radical&#8208;based pathways and reactions triggered by hydrometallation via a nickel&#8208;hydride complex, our experimental and computational studies support a mechanism in which a catalytically active nickel&#8208;bromide species promotes selective carbonickelation with difluoroalkenes followed by alkoxide exchange and hydride transfer, effectively overcoming the difluoroalkene&#8217;s intrinsic electronic bias.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharides or peptides prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule&#8217;s MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Bioorthogonal Reaction Enable the Enrichment of Photosensitizers and Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors for Pretargeted Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step tumor&#8208;pretargeted approach for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided cancer theranostics via cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction enhances the accumulation of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (SA&#8208;Tz) and photosensitizers (775NP&#8208;Tz) at the tumor site, efficiently alleviating hypoxic tumors and augmenting synergistic PDT efficacy in vivo.







Abstract
We report here a tumor&#8208;pretargted theranostic approach for multimodality imaging&#8208;guided synergistic cancer PDT by cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Using the enzymatic catalysis of ALP that continuously catalyses the dephosphorylation and self&#8208;assembly of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8208;bearing P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, a high density of fluorescent and magnetic TCO&#8208;containing nanoparticles (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) can be synthesized and retained on the membrane of tumor cells. They can act as &#8216;artificial antigens&#8217; amenable to concurrently capture lately administrated tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;decorated PS (775NP&#8208;Tz) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor (SA&#8208;Tz) via the fast IEDDA reaction. This two&#8208;step pretargeting process can further induce FMNPs&#8208;TCO regrowth into microparticles (FMNPs&#8208;775/SA) directly on tumor cell membranes, which is analyzed by bio&#8208;SEM and fluorescence imaging. Thus, efficient enrichment of both SA&#8208;Tz and 775NP&#8208;Tz in tumors can be achieved, allowing to alleviate hypoxia by continuously inhibiting CA activity and improving PDT of tumors. Findings show that subcutaneous HeLa tumors could be completely eradicated and no tumor recurred after irradiation with an 808&#8197;nm laser (0.33&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 10&#8197;min). This pretargeted approach may be applied to enrich other therapeutic agents in tumors to improve targeted therapy.

Using the enzymatic catalysis of ALP that continuously catalyses the dephosphorylation and self-assembly of trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-bearing &lt;b&gt;P-FFGd-TCO&lt;/b&gt;, a high density of fluorescent and magnetic TCO-containing nanoparticles (&lt;b&gt;FMNPs-TCO&lt;/b&gt;) can be synthesized and retained on the membrane of tumor cells. They can act as &#8216;artificial antigens&#8217; amenable to concurrently capture lately administrated tetrazine (Tz)-decorated PS (&lt;b&gt;775NP-Tz&lt;/b&gt;) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor (&lt;b&gt;SA-Tz&lt;/b&gt;) via the fast IEDDA reaction. This two-step pretargeting process can further induce &lt;b&gt;FMNPs-TCO&lt;/b&gt; regrowth into microparticles (&lt;b&gt;FMNPs-775/SA&lt;/b&gt;) directly on tumor cell membranes, which is analyzed by bio-SEM and fluorescence imaging. Thus, efficient enrichment of both &lt;b&gt;SA-Tz&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;775NP-Tz&lt;/b&gt; in tumors can be achieved, allowing to alleviate hypoxia by continuously inhibiting CA activity and improving PDT of tumors. Findings show that subcutaneous HeLa tumors could be completely eradicated and no tumor recurred after irradiation with an 808&#8197;nm laser (0.33&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&#8197;min). This pretargeted approach may be applied to enrich other therapeutic agents in tumors to improve targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quality Control of Mass&#8208;Encoded Nanodevices by Compartmented DNA Origami Frames for Precision Information Coding and Logic Mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of mass nanotags are prescribed in compartmented DNA origami frames to generate characteristic mass spectra with multiple well&#8208;defined signal intensities. The exclusivity of mass spectral patterns and orthogonality of multiplexed ion signal responses allow precise information coding and logic mapping.







Abstract
Encoded nanostructures afford an ideal platform carrying multi&#8208;channel signal components for multiplexed assay and information security. However, with the demand on exclusivity and reproducibility of coding signals, precise control on the structure and composition of nanomaterials featuring fully distinguishable signals remains challenging. By using the multiplexing capability of mass spectrometry (MS) and spatial addressability of DNA origami nanostructures, we herein propose a quality control methodology for constructing mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices (namely MNTs&#8208;TDOFs) in the scaffold of compartmented tetrahedral DNA origami frames (TDOFs), in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of four types of mass nanotags (MNTs) can be finely regulated and customized to generate characteristic MS patterns. The programmability of combinatorial MNTs and orthogonality of individual compartments allows further evolution of MNTs&#8208;TDOFs to static tagging agents and dynamic nanoprobes for labeling and sensing of multiple targets. More importantly, structure control at single TDOF level ensures the constancy of prescribed MS outputs, by which a high&#8208;capacity coding system was established for secure information encryption and decryption. In addition to the multiplexed outputs in parallel, the nanodevices could also map logic circuits with interconnected complexity and logic events of c&#8208;Met recognition and dimerization on cell surface for signaling regulation by MS interrogation.

         <title>Discovery of Natural Potent HMG&#8208;CoA Reductase Degraders for Lowering Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Schisandra macrocarpa was explored for the extraction of novel compounds from its fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23. Of the indole diterpenoids and derivatives identified, biological evaluation highlighted schipenindolene A as a potent HMGCR degrader that further lowered cholesterol with statin (HMGCR inhibitor) by activating the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation pathway and inhibiting the compensatory effects of statin.







Abstract
Exploitation of key protected wild plant resources makes great sense, but their limited populations become the major barrier. A particular strategy for breaking this barrier was inspired by the exploration of a resource&#8208;saving fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23, which inhabits the key protected wild plant Schisandra macrocarpa. Chemical studies on the cultures of this strain afforded eight novel indole diterpenoids, schipenindolenes A&#8722;H (1&#8211;8), belonging to six diverse skeleton types. Importantly, semisyntheses suggested some key nonenzymatic reactions constructing these molecules and provided targeted compounds, in particular schipenindolene A (Spid&#8197;A, 1) with low natural abundance. Remarkably, Spid&#8197;A was the most potent HMG&#8208;CoA reductase (HMGCR) degrader among the indole diterpenoid family. It degraded statin&#8208;induced accumulation of HMGCR protein, decreased cholesterol levels and acted synergistically with statin to further lower cholesterol. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling suggested that Spid&#8197;A potentially activated the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to enhance the degradation of HMGCR, while simultaneously inhibiting the statin&#8208;activated expression of many key enzymes in the cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways, thereby strengthening the efficacy of statins and potentially reducing the side effects of statins. Collectively, this study suggests the potential of Spid&#8197;A for treating cardiovascular disease.

         <title>A Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminophore for Activatable Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; afterglow probe was designed, exhibiting high 1O2 generation and capture ability with a single molecule. Through intramolecular energy transfer strategy, the afterglow probe showed an extremely bright afterglow luminescence with an emission wavelength located in NIR&#8208;I region (&gt;650&#8197;nm), which allowed deeper tissue penetration, higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, and imaging sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Afterglow luminescence imaging probes, with long&#8208;lived emission after cessation of light excitation, have drawn increasing attention in biomedical imaging field owing to their elimination of autofluorescence. However, current afterglow agents always suffer from an unsatisfactory signal intensity and complex systems consisting of multiple ingredients. To address these issues, this study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow luminophore (TPP&#8208;DO) by chemical conjugation of an afterglow substrate and a photosensitizer acting as both an afterglow initiator and an energy relay unit into a single molecule, resulting in an intramolecular energy transfer process to improve the afterglow brightness. The constructed TPP&#8208;DO NPs emit a strong NIR afterglow luminescence with a signal intensity of up to 108&#8197;p/s/cm2/sr at a low concentration of 10&#8197;&#956;M and a low irradiation power density of 0.05&#8197;W/cm2, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than most existing organic afterglow probes. The highly bright NIR afterglow luminescence with minimized background from TPP&#8208;DO NPs allows a deep tissue penetration depth ability. Moreover, we develop a GSH&#8208;activatable afterglow probe (Q&#8208;TPP&#8208;DO NPs) for ultrasensitive detection of subcutaneous tumor with the smallest tumor volume of 0.048&#8197;mm3, demonstrating the high potential for early diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided surgical resection of tumors.

         <title>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel dual nanoparticle conjugate sensor (DNCThr) for visualizing thrombin in live mice by fluorine&#8208;19 magnetic resonance imaging. DNCThr consists of mesoporous silica&#8208;coated perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (19F&#8208;MSNs) linked to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) via an aptamer and a complementary DNA strand. Target&#8208;induced dissociation results in particle separation and robust signal turn&#8208;on.







Abstract
Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer&#8208;based sensor for use in 19F MRI. DNC consists of core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19F&#8208;MSNs), which give a robust 19F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19F&#8208;MSNs. The probe functions as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor using target&#8208;induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept (DNCThr), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human &#945;&#8208;thrombin. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8211;Organic Hybrid &#8220;Calixarenes&#8221; as Supramolecular Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid calix[n]arenes (n=3, 4) can be rationally constructed from the coordination&#8208;driven assembly of polyoxometalate building blocks and dicarboxylate linkers with bite angles of 95&#176; and 120&#176;, respectively. With bowl&#8208;shaped, hydrophobic cavities similar to those of organic calixarenes, these molecular containers can host nanometer&#8208;sized Keggin and Dawson anions.







Abstract
Calixarenes are among the most useful and versatile macrocycles in supramolecular chemistry. The one thing that has not changed in the 80&#8197;years since their discovery, despite numerous derivatizations, is their fully organic, covalent scaffolds. Here, we report a new type of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid &#8220;calixarenes&#8221; constructed by means of coordination&#8208;driven assembly. Replacing acetate ligands on the {SiW10Cr2(OAc)2} clusters with 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalates allows these 95&#176; inorganic building blocks to be linked into bowl&#8208;shaped, hybrid &#8220;calix[n]arenes&#8221; (n=3, 4). With a large concave cavity, the metal&#8211;organic calix[4]arene can accommodate nanometer&#8208;sized polyoxoanions in an entropically driven process. The development of hybrid variants of calixarenes is expected to expand the scope of their physicochemical properties, guest/substrate binding, and applications on multiple fronts.

         <title>RAFT Polymerisation by the Radical Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled grafting of acrylate and acrylamide polymers from small molecule and polymer substrates has been achieved via the radical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids. These reactions proceed with high efficiency and low dispersity, giving highly functionalised polymers in a single step.







Abstract
The controlled grafting of polymers from small&#8208; and macro&#8208;molecular substrates is an essential process for many advanced polymer applications. This usually requires the pre&#8208;functionalisation of substrates with an appropriate functional group, such as a RAFT agent or ATRP initiator, which requires additional synthetic steps. In this paper, we describe the direct grafting of RAFT polymers from carboxylate containing small molecules and polymers via photochemical radical decarboxylation. This method utilises the innate functional groups present in the substrates, and achieves efficient polymer initiation in a single step with excellent control of molecular weight and dispersity.

         <title>Why do Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Catalysts Outperform both Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts and Nanocatalysts on MXene?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuNi SAAs on MXene combine the multiple advantages of NPs, SAC, and MXene to promote rapid dehydrogenation of AB hydrolysis. RuNiSAA&#8208;3&#8722;Ti3C2Tx with an optimal d&#8208;band center achieves the highest activity (333&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;gRu&#8722;1) toward AB hydrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs), combining the advantages of single&#8208;atom and nanoparticles (NPs), play an extremely significant role in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, understanding the catalytic mechanism of SAAs in catalysis reactions remains a challenge compared with single atoms and NPs. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;nickel SAAs (RuNiSAAs) synthesized by embedding atomically dispersed Ru in Ni NPs are anchored on two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene. The RuNiSAA&#8208;3&#8722;Ti3C2Tx catalysts exhibit unprecedented activity for hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis with a mass&#8208;specific activity (rmass) value of 333&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;gRu&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations reveal that the anchoring of SAAs on Ti3C2Tx optimizes the dissociation of AB and H2O as well as the binding ability of H* intermediates during AB hydrolysis due to the d&#8208;band structural modulation caused by the alloying effect and metal&#8208;supports interactions (MSI) compared with single atoms and NPs. This work provides useful design principles for developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen&#8208;related catalysts and demonstrates the advantages of SAAs over NPs and single atoms in energy catalysis.

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effect Shifts CO2 to CO Reduction by Iron Porphyrin from Fe0 to FeI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired second coordination sphere inducing a multipoint hydrogen bonding network triggers CO2 activation at an earlier stage of the reaction mechanism in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction by an iron porphyrin catalyst. Electrochemical and comprehensive spectroscopic investigations supported by DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented change in the active species&#8217; formal oxidation state from Fe(0) to Fe(I).







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the most studied molecular catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and their reactivity is constantly being enhanced through the implementation of chemical functionalities in the second coordination sphere inspired by the active sites of enzymes. In this study, we were intrigued to observe that a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme provided by embarked urea groups could also shift the redox activation step of CO2 from the well&#8208;admitted Fe(0) to the Fe(I) state. Using EPR, resonance Raman, IR and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopies, we underpinned a two&#8208;electron activation step of CO2 starting from the Fe(I) oxidation state to form, after protonation, an Fe(III)&#8722;COOH species. The addition of another electron and a proton to the latter species converged to the cleavage of a C&#8722;O bond with the loss of water molecule resulting in an Fe(II)&#8722;CO species. DFT analyses of these postulated intermediates are in good agreement with our collected spectroscopic data, allowing us to propose an alternative pathway in the catalytic CO2 reduction with iron porphyrin catalyst. Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi&#8208;electronic CO2 reduction catalysis.

         <title>In Situ Vaccination with An Injectable Nucleic Acid Hydrogel for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By crosslinking PD&#8208;L1 siRNA with a SN38&#8208; and CpG&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, an injectable three&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid hydrogel was synthesized and performed as an in situ cancer vaccine. Upon injection, the obtained hydrogel strongly induced ICD effects, promoted DC maturation, and increased CTL infiltration in tumors, leading to an enhanced antitumor performance of immunotherapy.







Abstract
Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have emerged as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, their efficacies are frequently impeded by challenges including inadequate antigen encapsulation, insufficient immune activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report a three&#8208;in&#8208;one hydrogel assembled by nucleic acids (NAs) that can serve as a vaccine to in situ trigger strong immune response against cancer. Through site&#8208;specifically grafting the chemodrug, 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (also known as SN38), onto three component phosphorothioate (PS) DNA strands, a Y&#8208;shaped motif (Y&#8208;motif) with sticky ends is self&#8208;assembled, at one terminus of which an unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine (CpG) segment is introduced as an immune agonist. Thereafter, programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) siRNA that performs as immune checkpoint inhibitor is designed as a crosslinker to assemble with the CpG&#8208; and SN38&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, resulting in the formation of final NA hydrogel vaccine. With three functional agents inside, the hydrogel can remarkably induce the immunogenic cell death to enhance the antigen presentation, promoting the dendritic cell maturation and effector T lymphocyte infiltration, as well as relieving the immunosuppressive tumor environment. When inoculated twice at tumor sites, the vaccine demonstrates a substantial antitumor effect in melanoma mouse model, proving its potential as a general platform for synergistic cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;By crosslinking PD-L1 siRNA with a SN38- and CpG-containing Y-motif, an injectable three-in-one nucleic acid hydrogel was synthesized and performed as an in situ cancer vaccine. Upon injection, the obtained hydrogel strongly induced ICD effects, promoted DC maturation, and increased CTL infiltration in tumors, leading to an enhanced antitumor performance of immunotherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have emerged as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, their efficacies are frequently impeded by challenges including inadequate antigen encapsulation, insufficient immune activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report a three-in-one hydrogel assembled by nucleic acids (NAs) that can serve as a vaccine to in situ trigger strong immune response against cancer. Through site-specifically grafting the chemodrug, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (also known as SN38), onto three component phosphorothioate (PS) DNA strands, a Y-shaped motif (Y-motif) with sticky ends is self-assembled, at one terminus of which an unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) segment is introduced as an immune agonist. Thereafter, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) siRNA that performs as immune checkpoint inhibitor is designed as a crosslinker to assemble with the CpG- and SN38-containing Y-motif, resulting in the formation of final NA hydrogel vaccine. With three functional agents inside, the hydrogel can remarkably induce the immunogenic cell death to enhance the antigen presentation, promoting the dendritic cell maturation and effector T lymphocyte infiltration, as well as relieving the immunosuppressive tumor environment. When inoculated twice at tumor sites, the vaccine demonstrates a substantial antitumor effect in melanoma mouse model, proving its potential as a general platform for synergistic cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Chemo&#8208; and Biocatalytic Route to 16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids: Asymmetric Synthesis of Betamethasone Dipropionate, Clobetasol Propionate, and Beclomethasone Dipropionate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 14&#8211;15 step asymmetric synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids is described. The synthesis highlights a Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8208;reduction hydration and an innovative enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation for the functionalization of the D&#8197;ring and A&#8197;ring, respectively, establishing a versatile platform for the access to various glucocorticoids and related steroids.







Abstract
16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids are among the most important glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of various dermatological disorders, respiratory infections, and other allergic reactions elicited during inflammatory responses of the human body. Betamethasone dipropionate, clobetasol propionate, and beclomethasone dipropionate are particularly noteworthy for their synthetic intractability. Despite five decades of research, these 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids have remained challenging synthetic targets owing to insurmountable issues of reactivity, selectivity, and cost efficiency associated with all previously explored strategies. We herein report our practicability&#8208;oriented strategy toward the unified stereoselective synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids in 12.6&#8211;14.0&#8201;% overall yield from commercially available 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxyandrost&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3,17&#8208;dione (9&#945;&#8208;OH&#8208;AD). In this approach, the chiral C16&#946;&#8208;Me and C17&#945;&#8208;OH groups of the corticosteroid D ring were installed via a substrate&#8208;controlled diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8208;reduction hydration of &#916;4,9(11),16&#8208;triene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The C1&#8722;C2 double bond of the corticosteroid A ring was constructed using an unprecedented engineered 3&#8208;ketosteroid&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (MK4&#8208;KstD)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation of &#916;4,9(11)&#8208;diene&#8208;3,21&#8208;dione. This strategy provides a general method and a key precursor for the divergent synthesis of a variety of glucocorticoids and related steroidal drugs.

         <title>A General Method to Access Sterically Encumbered Geminal Bis(boronates) via Formal Umpolung Transformation of Terminal Diboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for accessing sterically encumbered geminal bis(boronates) was developed based on a formal umpolung strategy. The polarity inversion of the readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes allows their corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives to undergo a formal substitution with a wide variety of nucleophiles to form C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds, featuring excellent tolerance to steric hindrance and functional groups.







Abstract
General methods for the preparation of geminal bis(boronates) are of great interest due to their widespread applications in organic synthesis. While the terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds are readily accessible, the construction of the sterically encumbered, internal analogues has remained a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a formal umpolung strategy to access these valuable building blocks. The readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes were first converted into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives, which then serve as electrophilic components, undergoing a formal substitution with a diverse array of nucleophiles to form a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds. This protocol features good tolerance to steric hindrance and a wide variety of functional groups and heterocycles. Notably, this strategy can also be extended to the synthesis of diaryl and terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds, therefore providing a general approach to various types of geminal bis(boronates).

         <title>Fluorescent&#8208;Probe Characterization for Pore&#8208;Space Mapping with Single&#8208;Particle Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithography&#8208;made, two&#8208;dimensional model pore was used to characterize the motion behavior of individual, confined, fluorescent probes under varying pH conditions. The obtained knowledge enabled the pore&#8208;space exploration and mapping of more complex silica materials, such as a real&#8208;life polymerization&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support particle, with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution.







Abstract
Porous solids often contain complex pore networks with pores of various sizes. Tracking individual fluorescent probes as they diffuse through porous materials can be used to characterize pore networks at tens of nanometers resolution. However, understanding the motion behavior of fluorescent probes in confinement is crucial to reliably derive pore network properties. Here, we introduce well&#8208;defined lithography&#8208;made model pores developed to study probe behavior in confinement. We investigated the influence of probe&#8208;host interactions on diffusion and trapping of confined single&#8208;emitter quantum&#8208;dot probes. Using the pH&#8208;responsiveness of the probes, we were able to largely suppress trapping at the pore walls. This enabled us to define experimental conditions for mapping of the accessible pore space of a one&#8208;dimensional pore array as well as a real&#8208;life polymerization&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support particle.

         <title>Wavelength Selective Photocontrol of Hybrid Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran Photoswitches with Overlapping Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two novel photoswitch azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads which are connected in meta or para position. While in the meta&#8208;analogue the two switching units behaves orthogonally according to the meta&#8208;rule, we exploited the red&#8208;shift in the p&#8208;substituted compound to obtain decoupled switching moieties. These insights provide the basis for the development of new multichromic switches for information and energy storage or other applications.







Abstract
Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized novel meta&#8208; and para&#8208; connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated their photochemistry using static and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta&#8208;compound, the individual components are photochemically decoupled due to the meta&#8208;pattern. In the para&#8208;compound the spiro&#8208;connectivity leads to a bifunctional photoswitchable system with a red&#8208;shifted absorption. The azobenzene and the spiropyran can thus be addressed and switched independently by light of appropriate wavelength. Through the different connectivity patterns two different orthogonally photoswitchable systems have been obtained which are promising candidates for complex applications of light control.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly&#8212;Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;shaped polyphiles self&#8208;assemble into a liquid quasicrystal and a series of liquid&#8208;crystalline periodic approximants, all representing polygonal honeycombs formed by the stacking of p&#8208;terphenyls. Featuring giant octagonal motifs containing non&#8208;regular trapezoidal or pentagonal with regular triangular and square tiles, the phases assume a transition of motif orientation, triggered by the changing conformation and entropy of the alkyl end chains.







Abstract
Quasiperiodic patterns and crystals&#8212;having long range order without translational symmetry&#8212;have fascinated researchers since their discovery. In this study, we report on new p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles with two alkyl end chains and a glycerol&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded side group that self&#8208;assemble into an aperiodic columnar liquid quasicrystal with 12&#8208;fold symmetry and its periodic liquid&#8208;crystalline approximants with complex superstructures. All represent honeycombs formed by the self&#8208;assembly of the p&#8208;terphenyls, dividing space into prismatic cells with polygonal cross&#8208;sections. In the perspective of tiling patterns, the presence of unique trapezoidal tiles, consisting of three rigid sides formed by the p&#8208;terphenyls and one shorter, incommensurate, and adjustable side by the alkyl end chains, plays a crucial role for these phases. A delicate temperature&#8208;dependent balance between conformational, entropic and space&#8208;filling effects determines the role of the alkyl chains, either as network nodes or trapezoid walls, thus resulting in the order&#8208;disorder transitions associated with emergence of quasiperiodicity. In&#8208;depth analysis suggests a change from a quasiperiodic tiling involving trapezoids to a modified one with a contribution of trapezoid pair fusion. This work paves the way for understanding quasiperiodicity emergence and develops fundamental concepts for its generation by chemical design of non&#8208;spherical molecules, aggregates, and frameworks based on dynamic reticular chemistry.

         <title>Unified Synthesis of 2&#8208;Isocyanoallopupukeanane and 9&#8208;Isocyanopupukeanane through a &#8220;Contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiospecific formal syntheses of 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane and 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane were achieved in 10 and 15 steps, respectively. These short synthetic sequences were enabled by a key palladium&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade and culminated in an unprecedented &#8220;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; rearrangement, which was investigated computationally and allows access to the related pupukeanane core as a sultone.







Abstract
Herein, we describe our synthetic efforts toward the pupukeanane natural products, in which we have completed the first enantiospecific route to 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane in 10 steps (formal synthesis), enabled by a key Pd&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade. This subsequently facilitated an unprecedented bio&#8208;inspired &#8220;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; rearrangement, providing divergent access to 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane in 15 steps (formal synthesis). Computational studies provide insight into the nature of this rearrangement.

         <title>Reactivity of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] towards Carbenes, Silylenes and Germylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) with carbenes gives unique adducts, while its reaction with CAACs affords a novel CAAC&#8208;stabilized As6 sawhorse compound. With silylenes and germylenes, unprecedented norbornadiene&#8208;like heteroatomic As6EL (E=Si, Ge; L=PhC(NtBu)2) ligands are accessible.







Abstract
The reaction behavior of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) towards carbenes and their heavier analogs was investigated. The reaction of I with NHCs (NHCs=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) results in the first substitution products of polyarsenic ligand complexes by NHCs [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5NHC)] (1&#8201;a: NHC=IMe=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, 1&#8201;b: NHC=IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the reaction of I with EtCAAC (EtCAAC=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) leads to a fragmentation and the formation of an unprecedented As6&#8208;sawhorse&#8208;type compound [As2(AsEtCAAC)4] (2). The reaction of (LE)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2; E=Si, Ge) with I resulted in a rearrangement and an insertion of LE fragments, forming unique silicon&#8208; (4: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As4SiL)], 5&#8201;a: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6SiL)) and germanium&#8208;containing (5&#8201;b: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6GeL)) cyclic polyarsenic ligand complexes.

         <title>Particle Engineering via Supramolecular Assembly of Macroscopic Hydrophobic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrophobic polymer building blocks enables the engineering of metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) particle properties (shell thickness, stiffness, permeability), and facilitates incorporation of functional molecules and control of cell association behavior. This study demonstrates the rational design and fabrication of hydrophobic MPNs with expanded utility for diverse applications.







Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophobicity of supramolecular assembly building blocks enables the fabrication of well&#8208;defined functional materials. However, the selection of building blocks used in the assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), an emerging supramolecular assembly platform for particle engineering, has been essentially limited to hydrophilic molecules. Herein, we synthesized and applied biscatechol&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic polymers (poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)) as building blocks to engineer MPN particle systems (particles and capsules). Our method allowed control over the shell thickness (e.g., between 10 and 21&#8197;nm), stiffness (e.g., from 10 to 126&#8197;mN&#8201;m&#8722;1), and permeability (e.g., 28&#8211;72&#8201;% capsules were permeable to 500&#8197;kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate&#8208;dextran) of the MPN capsules by selection of the hydrophobic polymer building blocks (PMA or PBA) and by controlling the polymer concentration in the MPN assembly solution (0.25&#8211;2.0&#8197;mM) without additional/engineered assembly processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the structural states of the hydrophobic building blocks during assembly and mechanism of film formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MPNs facilitated the preparation of fluorescent&#8208;labeled and bioactive capsules through postfunctionalization and also particle&#8211;cell association engineering by controlling the hydrophobicity of the building blocks. Engineering MPN particle systems via building block hydrophobicity is expected to expand their use.

Self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole with diamines in the presence of Zn(II)/Cd(II) resulted in the formation of a [2]catenane, trefoil knot, and Borromean rings. The presence of a diminopyrrole coordination motif rendered all new systems intrinsically flexible, as demonstrated by the combination of NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and computational studies.







Abstract
The use of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole in self&#8208;assembly reactions with diamines and Zn(II)/Cd(II) salts allowed the preparation of [2]catenane, trefoil knot, and Borromean rings. The intrinsically dynamic nature of the diiminopyrrole motif rendered all of the formed assemblies intramolecularly flexible. The presence of diiminopyrrole revealed new coordination motifs and influenced the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the systems, as illustrated by hexafluorophosphate encapsulation by Borromean rings.

         <title>Ba12[BN2]6.67H4: A Disordered Anti&#8208;Skutterudite filled with Nitridoborate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel barium nitridoborate hydride was obtained by a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction and its crystal structure was elucidated by X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data. It crystallizes as a filled anti&#8208;skutterudite, featuring nitridoborate and hydride anions inside a barium host lattice. The structure model was further confirmed by magic angle spinning NMR, vibrational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Skutterudites are of high interest in current research due to their diversity of structures comprising empty, partially filled and filled variants, mostly based on metallic compounds. We herein present Ba12[BN2]6.67H4, forming a non&#8208;metallic filled anti&#8208;skutterudite. It is accessed in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction from barium subnitride, boron nitride and barium hydride at 750&#8201;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data allowed to elucidate the structure in the cubic space group Im
 (no. 204). The barium and hydride atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional network consisting of corner&#8208;sharing HBa6 octahedra and Ba12 icosahedra. Slightly bent [BN2]3&#8722; units are located in the icosahedra and the voids in&#8208;between. 1H and 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments and vibrational spectroscopy further support the structure model. Quantum chemical calculations coincide well with experimental results and provide information about the electronic structure of Ba12[BN2]6.67H4.

         <title>Fluorination Strategy Towards Symmetry Breaking of Boron&#8208;centered Tetrahedron for Poly&#8208;fluorinated Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ten fluorooxoborates with rarely tri&#8208;fluorinated [BF3X] (X=O and CH3) tetrahedra were found using the bifluoride salts as a strong source of fluorine. We identified the optical properties of the organofluorinated group [CH3BF3] and their potential for nonlinear optics for the first time. Additionally, the mixed anion technique and the anion replacement strategy were used to synthesize two isomorphic examples of non&#8208;centrosymmetric nitrates.







Abstract
Borate crystals can be chemically and functionally modified by the fluorination strategy, which encourages the identification of emerging fluorooxoborates with a structure and set of characteristics not seen in any other oxide parents. However, the bulk of fluorooxoborates have been found accidentally, rational methods of synthesis are required, particularly for the infrequently occurring poly&#8208;fluorinated components. Herein, we reported the use of bifluoride salts as a potent source of fluorine to prepare fluorooxoborates that contain rarely tri&#8208;fluorinated [BF3X] (X=O and CH3) tetrahedra and eleven compounds were found. We identified the optical properties of the organofluorinated group [CH3BF3] and their potential for nonlinear optics for the first time. Among these, two non&#8208;centrosymmetric components hold potential for the production of 266&#8197;nm harmonic coherent light for nonlinear optics, and more crucially, have the benefit of growing large size single crystals. Our study establishes experimental conditions for the coexistence of the diverse functional groups, enabling the production of poly&#8208;fluorinated optical crystals.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Resonance Phosphine Oxide Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new phosphine oxide based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeleton is demonstrated with CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO featuring highly efficient ultraviolet (UV) multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, whose device achieved narrow&#8208;band emissions with peaks at &#8776;380&#8197;nm and full widths at half maximum of &#8776;30&#8197;nm, and especially record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies beyond 15&#8201;%.







Abstract
Efficient ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescent materials remain a great challenge, since short peak wavelength &lt;400&#8197;nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) &lt;50&#8197;nm are simultaneously required. In this sense, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring narrow&#8208;band emissions hold the promise for UV applications. Herein, a novel MR&#8208;TADF skeleton featuring carbazole&#8208;phosphine oxide (P=O) fused aromatics is developed to construct the first two UV MR emitters named CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO. In addition to synergistic resonance effects of P=O and N atom, sp3&#8208;hybrid P atom renders the curved polycyclic planes of CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO, giving rise to their narrowband UV emissions with peak wavelengths &lt;390&#8197;nm and FWHM&lt;35&#8197;nm. Besides configuration quasi&#8208;planarization for radiation enhancement and quenching suppression, P=O moiety further enhances singlet&#8208;triplet coupling to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence quantum yield of 62&#8201;% in tBCzP2PO doped films. As consequence, tBCzP2PO endowed its UV organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak at 382&#8197;nm and FWHM of 32&#8197;nm, and especially the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1&#8201;% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Double Angstrom&#8208;Scale Confinement in Ti&#8208;deficient Ti0.87O2 Nanosheet Membranes for Ultrahigh&#8208;performance Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a Ti&#8208;deficient Ti0.87O2 nanosheet membrane with biological double angstrom&#8208;scale confinement (DAC) ion&#8208;permselective channels, named DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2, for high&#8208;efficiency osmotic power generators. Benefiting from the precisely designed DAC ion&#8208;permselective channels, the DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membrane achieves an unprecedented power density of up to 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl solution, far exceeding the reported macroscopic&#8208;scale membranes.







Abstract
Osmotic power, a clean energy source, can be harvested from the salinity difference between seawater and river water. However, the output power densities are hampered by the trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and ion permeability. Here we propose an effective strategy of double angstrom&#8208;scale confinement (DAC) to design ion&#8208;permselective channels with enhanced ion selectivity and permeability simultaneously. The fabricated DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membranes possess both Ti atomic vacancies and an interlayer free spacing of &#8776;2.2&#8197;&#197;, which not only generates a profitable confinement effect for Na+ ions to enable high ion selectivity but also induces a strong interaction with Na+ ions to benefit high ion permeability. Consequently, when applied to osmotic power generation, the DAC&#8208;Ti0.87O2 membranes achieved an ultrahigh power density of 17.8&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl solution and up to 114.2&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, far exceeding all the reported macroscopic&#8208;scale membranes. This work highlights the potential of the construction of DAC ion&#8208;permselective channels for two&#8208;dimensional materials in high&#8208;performance nanofluidic energy systems.

         <title>Controllable Electrochemical Liberation of Hydrogen from Sodium Borohydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali cell was proposed by coupling acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with alkaline NaBH4 electrooxidation reaction (BOR), which demonstrated a maximum power density of 20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieved a high current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during discharging. Additionally, the cell showcased remarkable capabilities for precise and controllable indirect release of H2 stored in NaBH4 at ambient temperature and pressure.







Abstract
Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has earned recognition as a promising hydrogen carrier, attributed to its exceptional hydrogen storage capacity, boasting a high theoretical storage capacity of 10.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Nonetheless, the utilization of traditional pyrolysis and hydrolysis methods still presents a formidable challenge in achieving controlled hydrogen generation especially under ambient conditions. In this work, we report an innovative electrochemical strategy for production H2 by coupling NaBH4 electrooxidation reaction (BOR) at anode in alkaline media with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode in acidic media. To implement this, we have developed a bifunctional electrocatalyst denoted as Pd&#8208;Mo2C@CNTs, wherein Pd nanoparticles are grown in situ on Mo2C embedded within N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes. This electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in catalyzing both alkaline BOR and acidic HER. We have developed a hybrid acid/alkali cell, utilizing Pd/Mo2C@CNTs as the anode and cathode electrocatalysts. This configuration showcases remarkable capabilities for self&#8208;sustained, precise, and uninterrupted indirect release of H2 stored in NaBH4, even at high current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faraday efficiency approaching 100&#8201;%. Additionally, this electrochemical device exhibits significant promise as a fuel cell, with the ability to deliver a maximum power density of 20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Fluorinated Solid&#8208;state&#8208;electrolyte Interface Layer Guiding Fast Zinc&#8208;ion Oriented Deposition in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fluorinated solid electrolyte interfacial layer to guide the oriented deposition of zinc ions along the (002) crystal plane of Zn anode to inhibit the growth of zinc dendrites and accelerate the migration of zinc ions at the anode interface during cycling and improve the electrochemical performance of the battery.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are gaining popularity due to their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, random deposition of zinc ions on the anode and sluggish migration of zinc ions on the interface would lead to the growth of zinc dendrites and poor cycling performance. To address these challenges, we developed a fluorinated solid&#8208;state&#8208;electrolyte interface layer composed of Ca5(PO4)3F/Zn3(PO4)2 via an in situ ion exchange strategy to guide zinc&#8208;ion oriented deposition and fast zinc ion migration on the anode during cycling. The introduction of Ca5(PO4)3F (FAP) can increase the nucleation sites of zinc ions and guide the oriented deposition of zinc ions along the (002) crystal plane, while the in situ formation of Zn3(PO4)2 during cycling can accelerate the migration of zinc ions. Benefited from our design, the assembled Zn//V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O batteries based on FAP&#8208;protected Zn anode (FAP&#8208;Zn) achieve a higher capacity retention of 84&#8201;% (220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) than that of bare&#8208;Zn based batteries, which have a capacity retention of 23&#8201;% (97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a new solution for the rational design and development of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Can Magnetic Dipole Transition Moment Be Engineered?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density Functional Theory (DFT) in combination with clustering analysis allowed the identification of a common transition in helical compounds, whose magnetic dipole transition moment |m| and the inner area have a linear relationship. The findings provide a tool for a rationalized design of helical organic molecules with improved chiroptical properties.







Abstract
The development of chiral compounds with enhanced chiroptical properties is an important challenge to improve device applications. To that end, an optimization of the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments of the molecule is necessary. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemical structure and such quantum mechanical properties is not always clear. That is the case of magnetic dipole transition moment (m) for which no general trends for its optimization have been suggested. In this work we propose a general rationalization for improving the magnitude of m in different families of chiral compounds. Performing a clustering analysis of hundreds of transitions, we have been able to identify a single group in which |m| value is maximized along the helix axis. More interestingly, we have found an accurate linear relationship (up to R2=0.994) between the maximum value of this parameter and the area of the inner cavity of the helix, thus resembling classical behavior of solenoids. This research provides a tool for the rationalized synthesis of compounds with improved chiroptical responses.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free B&#8722;B Dehydrocoupling Reaction of a Simple Borane Adduct: Convenient Access to a Nucleophilic Diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, the formation of a B&#8722;B bond is accomplished by reduction of a haloborane. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reaction starting with a simple, readily available borane adduct. A detailed mechanistical examination paves the way for a rational approach to thermal B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reactions.







Abstract
The selective formation of homonuclear bonds is of key importance in synthetic chemistry. Especially, dehydrocoupling reactions are attractive as ecologically and economically friendly alternatives to established reductive bond forming reactions, since they do not require the use of stoichiometric amounts of a reducing reagent and produce only valuable dihydrogen as by&#8208;product. Here, we report on a metal&#8208;free B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reaction that starts directly from a simple, easily accessible BH3 adduct, providing convenient access to a new nucleophilic dihydridodiborane in excellent yield. The dihydridodiborane in turn activates dihydrogen, allowing to obtain quantitatively the dideuteridodiborane from the dihydridodiborane by D2 activation. On the basis of detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the mechanism of this unprecedented reaction is elucidated. Some key points that are essential for metal&#8208;free dehydrocoupling are disclosed, paving the way for their systematic evaluation and application.

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the formation of a B&#8722;B bond is accomplished by reduction of a haloborane. Here, we report a metal-free B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reaction starting with a simple, readily available borane adduct. A detailed mechanistical examination paves the way for a rational approach to thermal B&#8722;B dehydrocoupling reactions.

         <title>Accelerated Redox Reactions Enable Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A V3+/V2+ redox couple was developed to accelerate the spontaneous redox reactions between Sn4+ and Pb0, enabling the perpetual regeneration of Sn2+ and Pb2+ for self&#8208;healing tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskites under light soaking. The target vanadium&#8208;containing tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite (V&#8722;Sn&#8722;Pb) solar cells showed substantially improved durability over 1000&#8197;hours under operation.







Abstract
The facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ poses an inherent challenge that limits the efficiency and stability of tin&#8208;lead mixed (Sn&#8722;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices. In this work, we discover the sustainable redox reactions enabling self&#8208;healing Sn&#8722;Pb perovskites, where their intractable oxidation degradation can be recovered to their original state under light soaking. Quantitative and operando spectroscopies are used to investigate the redox chemistry, revealing that metallic Pb0 from the photolysis of perovskite reacts with Sn4+ to regenerate Pb2+ and Sn2+ spontaneously. Given the sluggish redox reaction kinetics, V3+/V2+ ionic pair is designed as an effective redox shuttle to accelerate the recovery of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskites from oxidation. The target Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs enabled by V3+/V2+ ionic pair deliver an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.22&#8201;% and excellent device lifespan, retaining nearly 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking under light for 1,000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Heteromorphosis Multi&#8208;Cavity Cages: Tension&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Expansion Strategy for Controllable Enhancement of Complexity in Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain&#8208;dependent capping strategy was proposed to obtain a series of multi&#8208;cavity cages, where dimetallic double&#8208;cavity cages and triple&#8208;cavity cages were formed through the geometric matching and the strain&#8208;induced tension, respectively. This is the first time that discrete supramolecular cages with three cavities have been achieved through the application of molecular strain.







Abstract
Coordinative supramolecular cages with adjustable cavities have found extensive applications in various fields, but the cavity modification strategies for multi&#8208;functional structures are still challenging. Here, we present a tension&#8208;driven self&#8208;expansion strategy for construction of multi&#8208;cavity cages with high structural complexity. Under the regulation of strain&#8208;induced capping ligands, unprecedented heteromorphosis triple&#8208;cavity cages S2/S4 were obtained based on a metallo&#8208;organic ligand (MOL) scaffold. The heteromorphosis cages exhibited significant higher cavity diversity than the homomorphous double&#8208;cavity cages S1/S3; all of the cages were thoroughly characterized through various analytical techniques including (1D and 2D) NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, TWIM&#8208;MS, AFM, and SAXS analyses. Furthermore, the encapsulation of porphyrin in the cavities of these multi&#8208;cavity cages were investigated. This research opens up new possibilities for the architecture of heteromorphosis supramolecular cages via precisely controlled &#8220;scaffold&#8208;capping&#8221; assembly with preorganized ligands, which could have potential applications in the development of multifunctional structures with higher complexity.

         <title>Cocrystallization&#8208;driven Formation of fcc&#8208;based Ag110 Nanocluster with Chinese Triple Luban Lock Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luban locks with mortise and tenon structure have structural diversity and architectural stability, and it is extremely challenging to synthesize Luban lock&#8208;like structures at the molecular level. In this work, we report the cocrystallization of two structurally related atom&#8208;precise fcc silver nanoclusters Ag110(SPhF)48(PPh3)12 (Ag110) and Ag14(&#956;6&#8208;S)(SPhF)12(PPh3)8 (Ag14). It is worth noting that the Ag110 cluster is the first compound to simulate the complex Luban lock structure at the molecular level. Meanwhile, Ag110 is the largest known fcc&#8208;based silver nanocluster, so far, there is no precedent example fcc silver nanocluster with more than 100 silver atoms. DFT calculations show that Ag110 is a 58&#8208;electron superatom with an electronically closed shell1S21P61D102S21F142P61G18. Ag110&#8226;Ag14 can rapidly catalyze the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol within 4 minutes. In addition, Ag110 presents clear structural evidence to reveal the critical size and mechanism of the transformation of metal core from fcc stacking to quasi&#8208;spherical superatoms. This research work provides an important structural model for studying the nucleation mechanism and structural assembly of silver nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Dual Catalysis of Gold Nanoclusters: Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling by Cooperation of Superatomic Core and Molecularly Modified Staples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual catalysis of gold nanoclusters protected by thiolate ligands toward photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between aliphatic tertiary amines and terminal alkynes is reported by Katsuhiro Isozaki, Masaharu Nakamura et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312135). The cooperative catalytic properties of the superatomic core and gold&#8208;thiolate staples were elucidated by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations of ligand&#8208;exchanged nanoclusters as the catalytically active intermediates.

         <title>Supramolecular Membrane Chemistry in the Langton Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;We are excited by the possibilities of being able to use supramolecular systems to begin to engineer artificial cells that have complex collective behaviour&#8230; Within the Langton group we are delighted to have hosted many very successful MChem project students, many of whom have played a valuable contribution to our ongoing research projects&#8230;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Langton group.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Langton group in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford (UK). They recently published an article on a synthetic supramolecular signaling system, in which light is used to initiate the release of diffusible chemical signals from one population of vesicles to another. This triggers transmembrane cation transport in the receiver vesicles and amplifies the signal, in a manner reminiscent of signaling mechanisms in biology. &#8220;Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;responsive Zinc Ionophore&#8221;, S.&#8197;A. Gartland, T.&#8197;G. Johnson, E. Walkley, M.&#8197;J. Langton Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, 62, e202309080.

A redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from diaminotriazine&#8208;decorated hexaazatrinaphthalene and used as the cathode material in aqueous zinc ion batteries, as reported by Fengchao Cui, Heng&#8208;Guo Wang, Guangshan Zhu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202314411). The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow the HOF with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, a stable supramolecular structure and enhanced H+ storage.

         <title>A Systematic Investigation of Proteoforms with N&#8208;Terminal Glycine and Their Dynamics Reveals Its Impacts on Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;termini of proteins can regulate their degradation, and the same protein with different N&#8208;termini may have distinct dynamics. Recently, it was found that N&#8208;terminal glycine can serve as a degron recognized by two E3 ligases, but N&#8208;terminal glycine was also reported to stabilize proteins. Here we developed a chemoenzymatic method for selective enrichment of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine and integrated dual protease cleavage to further improve the enrichment specificity. Over 2000 unique peptides with protein N&#8208;terminal glycine were analyzed from &gt;1000 proteins in human cells, and most of them are previously unknown, indicating the effectiveness of the current method to capture low&#8208;abundance proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine. The degradation rates of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were quantified along with those of proteins from the whole proteome. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations. Membrane proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine and proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine from the N&#8208;terminal methionine excision degrade more rapidly. Furthermore, the secondary structures, adjacent amino acid residues, and protease specificities for N&#8208;terminal glycine are also vital for protein degradation. The results advance our understanding of the effects of N&#8208;terminal glycine on protein properties and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Benzils Achieved by Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In current approaches for circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, the crystallization of chiral phosphors suffers from poor processability, while integrating them into an amorphous polymer matrix results in unsatisfactory chiroptical signals due to the absence of chirality communication. Here, we have developed an innovative strategy through chiral supramolecular polymerization of benzil phosphors facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities of non&#8208;covalent supramolecular polymers obviate the need for an external polymer matrix. The pronounced helical asymmetry of benzil phosphors resulting from chiral supramolecular polymerization leads to enhanced circularly polarized phosphorescence compared to their non&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonded counterparts. The circularly polarized phosphorescent signals can be further modulated by varying the location of stereogenic centers or introducing halogen bonding to benzils. Incorporation of platinum(II) phosphor into the benzil supramolecular polymers induces both chirality and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, leading to a change in circularly polarized phosphorescent color from yellow to red. In summary, chiral supramolecular polymerization of phosphors represents a novel and effective approach to circularly polarized phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors have demonstrated promising potentials in biomedical applications, especially for catalytic tumor therapy, owing to their ability of self&#8208;propulsion and bio&#8208;catalysis. However, the fragility of natural enzymes limits their environmental adaptability and also therapeutic efficacy in catalysis enabled tumor therapy. Herein, polyoxometalate nanozyme&#8208;based light&#8208;driven nanomotors were designed and synthesized for targeted synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic tumor therapy. In this construct, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the P2W18Fe4 polyoxometalates&#8208;based nanomotors can provide self&#8208;propulsion and facilitate their production of reactive oxygen species thus killing tumor cells, even in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment. Conjugated polydopamine endows the nanomotors with capability of light&#8208;driven self&#8208;propulsion behavior. After 10 min of NIR (808 nm) irradiation, along with the help of epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, the targeted accumulation and penetration of nanomotors in the tumor enabled highly efficient synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic therapy. This approach overcomes the disadvantages of the intrinsic fragile nature of enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors in physiological environments, and more importantly, providing a motility&#8208;behavior promoted synergistic anti&#8208;tumor strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Atomic Sites Enable a Confined Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalytic Sulfur Conversion for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The broader implementation of current all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S batteries is still plagued by high operation temperature and inefficient sulfur utilization. And the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway along with the sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics further compromise the theoretical potentials of Na&#8208;S chemistry. Herein, we report a confined bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis effect to tune polysulfide electrochemistry in a novel low&#8208;temperature (80oC) all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S battery that utilizes Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane as a platform. The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated using a sacrificial template process. Upon discharge, CoN4 sites activate sulfur species and catalyze long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while MnN4 centers substantially accelerate the low&#8208;kinetic Na2S4 to Na2S directly conversion, manipulating the uniform deposition of electroactive Na2S and avoiding the formation of irreversible products (e.g., Na2S2). The intrinsic synergy of two catalytic centers benefits the Na2S decomposition and minimizes its activation barrier during battery recharging and then efficiently mitigate the cathodic passivation. As a result, the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S cell delivers an attractive reversible capacity of 1060 mAh g&#8208;1 with a high CE of 98.5% and a high energy of 1008&#8201;Wh kgcathode&#8208;1, comparable to the liquid electrolyte cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Soccer Ball&#8208;like Assembly of Edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge Oriented 2D&#8208;silica Nanosheets: A Promising Catalyst Support for High&#8208;Temperature Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;silica nanosheets undergo edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge oriented interlocking and self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like hollow shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The mechanically robust SA&#8208;SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal&#8208;catalysts for high&#8208;temperature methane reforming.







Abstract
Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well&#8208;defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D&#8208;nanomaterialsin self&#8208;assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties. This research unveils the discovery of controlled self&#8208;assembly of 2D&#8208;silica nanosheets (2D&#8208;SiNSs) into hollow micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The assembly is driven by the physical flexibility of the 2D&#8208;SiNSs and the differential electricdouble&#8208;layer charge gradient creating electrostatic bias on the edge and face regions. The resulting SA&#8208;SiMS structures exhibit high mechanical stability, even at high&#8208;temperatures, and exhibit excellent performance as catalyst support in the dry reforming of methane. The SA&#8208;SiMS structures facilitate improved mass transport, leading to enhanced reaction rates, while the thin silica shell prevents sintering of small catalyst nanocrystals, thereby preventing coke formation. This discovery sheds light on the controllable self&#8208;assembly of 2D nanomaterials and provides insights into the design and synthesis of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Tuning Active Site Flexibility by Defect Engineering of Graphene Ribbon Edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8722;N3 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the critical role of vertical displacement of Fe atom, which can be modulated by defect engineering, in tuning the electron structure and stabilizing the transition state of rate&#8208;determining step, and demonstrates that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity is determined by the flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site, which is further affected by the Fe&#8722;N bond length. Importantly, this simple geometric parameter is tunable and readily probed experimentally.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported transition metal catalysts are excellent for several reactions. Structural engineering of M&#8722;Nx sites to boost catalytic activity is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8722;N3 sites with varying Fe&#8722;N bond lengths distinguishable by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density&#8208;functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N3 distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high&#8208;performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.

         <title>Main&#8208;chain Macromolecular Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of hydrazone photoswitches as repeating units into a polymer main chain allows controlling the hydrodynamic volume changes upon photoisomerization by carefully engineering the location where the photoswitch is covalently weaved into the polymer backbone.







Abstract
Hydrazones&#8212;consisting of a dynamic imine bond and an acidic NH proton&#8212;have recently emerged as versatile photoswitches underpinned by their ability to form thermally bistable isomers, (Z) and (E), respectively. Herein, we introduce two photoresponsive homopolymers containing structurally different hydrazones as main&#8208;chain repeating units, synthesized via head&#8208;to&#8208;tail Acyclic Diene METathesis (ADMET) polymerization. Their key difference lies in the hydrazone design, specifically the location of the aliphatic arm connecting the rotor of the hydrazone photoswitch to the aliphatic polymer backbone. Critically, we demonstrate that their main photoresponsive property, i.e., their hydrodynamic volume, changes in opposite directions upon photoisomerization (&#955;=410&#8197;nm) in dilute solution. Further, the polymers&#8212;independent of the design of the individual hydrazone monomer&#8212;feature a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) by close to 10&#8201;&#176;C. The herein established design strategy allows to photochemically manipulate macromolecular properties by simple structural changes.

         <title>Photochemical [2+4]&#8208;Dimerization Reaction from the Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel divergent excited state reactivity of aryl&#8208;maleimides undergoing an unexpected [2+4]&#8208;photodimerization is presented with detailed mechanistic rationale. The stereochemistry of the photodimer formed is complementary to the product observed under thermal conditions and is dictated by the type of non&#8208;bonding interactions prevalent in the photoexcited reactant.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;maleimides undergo a novel [2+4]&#8208;photodimerization instead of the expected [2+2]&#8208;photodimerization under both direct irradiation with visible light and under sensitized energy transfer conditions. This new excited state reactivity in aryl&#8208;maleimides is deciphered through photochemical, photophysical, and spectroscopic studies. The stereochemistry of the photodimer depends on the type of non&#8208;bonding interactions prevalent during photodimerization which is in turn dictated by the substituents on the maleimide ring. More importantly, the stereochemistry of the photodimer formed is complementary to the product observed under thermal conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Luminescent Phenothiazinyl Merocyanine Substituted Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of soluble phenothiazinyl merocyanine substituted polyacetylenes have been readily synthesized by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of the corresponding 3&#8208;ethynyl phenothiazines. These polyacetylenes with conjugatively ligated merocyanines are emissive in solution and in the solid state and also show emission solvatochromism.







Abstract
A new generation of soluble phenothiazinyl merocyanine substituted polyacetylenes can be readily synthesized by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of the corresponding 3&#8208;ethynyl phenothiazines, accessible by Sonogashira coupling and Knoevenagel condensation. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy of 7&#8208;acceptor&#8208;substituted phenothiazinyl polyacetylenes reveal that these polyacetylenes with conjugatively ligated merocyanines are luminescent in solution with positive emission solvatochromism and, in some cases, with distinct solid&#8208;state luminescence.

         <title>One Collision&#8212;Two Substituents: Gas&#8208;Phase Preparation of Xylenes under Single&#8208;Collision Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl radical with C5H8 isomers (2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, 1,3&#8208;pentadiene). Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.







Abstract
The fundamental reaction pathways to the simplest dialkylsubstituted aromatics&#8212;xylenes (C6H4(CH3)2)&#8212;in high&#8208;temperature combustion flames and in low&#8208;temperature extraterrestrial environments are still unknown, but critical to understand the chemistry and molecular mass growth processes in these extreme environments. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure and statistical calculations, this study uncovers a previously elusive, facile gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl (methylethynyl, CH3CC) with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (isoprene, C5H8). The reaction dynamics are driven by a barrierless addition of the radical to the diene moiety of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene followed by extensive isomerization (hydrogen shifts, cyclization) prior to unimolecular decomposition accompanied by aromatization via atomic hydrogen loss. This overall exoergic reaction affords a preparation of xylenes not only in high&#8208;temperature environments such as in combustion flames and around circumstellar envelopes of carbon&#8208;rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, but also in low&#8208;temperature cold molecular clouds (10&#8197;K) and in hydrocarbon&#8208;rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Triton and Titan. Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.

         <title>Electroluminescent Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescent cluster materials and devices emerged rapidly in recent years. Their external quantum efficiencies reached &#8776;30&#8201;%, on the basis of ligand and device engineering. On account of the unique advantage of combining organic and inorganic components for enhanced luminescence properties and stability, cluster&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes hold promise for next&#8208;generation displays and lightings.







Abstract
Optoelectronic cluster materials emerge rapidly in recent years especially for light&#8208;emitting devices, owing to their 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting and unique organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid structures with tunable excited&#8208;state characteristics for thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence and inheritable photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;stability. However, for efficient electroluminescence, excited&#8208;state compositions of cluster emitters should be tuned through ligand engineering to enhance ligand&#8208;centered radiative components and reduce cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Nonetheless, the balance of optoelectronic properties requires delicate and controllable ligand functionalization. On the other hand, in addition to balancing carrier fluxes, it showed that device engineering, especially host matrixes and interfacial optimization, can not only alleviate triplet quenching, but also modify processing and passivate defects. As consequence, the record external quantum efficiencies of cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes already reached &#8776;30&#8201;%. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent cluster materials and discuss their structure&#8211;property relationships, which would inspire the continuous efforts making cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes competent as the new generation of displays and lighting sources.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Anhydrous Rare&#8208;Earth Trichlorides from their Oxides in Chloridoaluminate Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anhydrous rare&#8208;earth trichlorides RECl3 with high purity and yield are obtained by reacting rare&#8208;earth oxides RE2O3 with aluminum chloride AlCl3 containing ionic liquids at 175&#8201;&#176;C. The easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform process provides a reliable and scalable alternative to the production of these difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access anhydrous chlorides. In contrast to previous approaches, neither high temperatures nor highly toxic substances are required.







Abstract
Wide applications of anhydrous rare&#8208;earth (RE) trichlorides RECl3 in organometallic chemistry, for the synthesis of optical and magnetic materials, and as catalysts require a facile approach for their synthesis. The known methods use or produce toxic substances, are complicated and have limited reliability and upscaling. It has been shown that task&#8208;specific ionic liquids (ILs) can dissolve many metal oxides without special reaction conditions at moderate temperature, making the metals accessible to downstream chemistry. Using imidazolium chloridoaluminate ILs, pure crystalline anhydrous RECl3 (RE=La&#8722;Nd, Sm&#8722;Dy) can be synthesized in one step from RE oxides in high yield. The Lewis acidic IL acts as solvent and reaction partner. The by&#8208;product [Al4O2Cl10]2&#8722;, which was detected spectroscopically, remains in solution. The reacted IL can be removed quantitatively by washing. ILs with various imidazolium cations and AlCl3 content and the effect of temperature and reaction time were tested.

         <title>Inverse Adsorption Separation of N2O/CO2 in AgZK&#8208;5 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of silver exchanged zeolite and study the influence of cation types on CO2&#8722;N2O separation. The inverse adsorption of CO2&#8722;N2O was achieved after Ag+ exchanged and it can preferentially adsorb N2O over CO2, making it capable of trapping N2O from an N2O/CO2 mixture.







Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O), as the third largest greenhouse gas in the world, also has great applications in daily life and industrial production, like anesthetic, foaming agent, combustion supporting agent, N or O atomic donor. The capture of N2O in adipic acid tail gas is of great significance but remains challenging due to the similarity with CO2 in molecular size and physical properties. Herein, the influence of cation types on CO2&#8722;N2O separation in zeolite was studied comprehensively. In particular, the inverse adsorption of CO2&#8722;N2O was achieved by AgZK&#8208;5, which preferentially adsorbs N2O over CO2, making it capable of trapping N2O from an N2O/CO2 mixture. AgZK&#8208;5 shows a recorded N2O/CO2 selectivity of 2.2, and the breakthrough experiment indicates excellent performance for N2O/CO2 separation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that Ag+ has stronger adsorption energy with N2O, and the kinetics of N2O is slightly faster than that of CO2 on AgZK&#8208;5.

In particular, the inverse adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was achieved by AgZK-5, which preferentially adsorbs N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, making it capable of trapping N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from an N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture. AgZK-5 shows a recorded N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 2.2, and the breakthrough experiment indicates excellent performance for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has stronger adsorption energy with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and the kinetics of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is slightly faster than that of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on AgZK-5.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Automated Structural Activity Screening of &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Assemblies with High&#8208;Throughput Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robotically prepared combinatorial libraries of &#946;&#8208;diketonates were analysed with high&#8208;throughput ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. The dynamic ensemble of components and assemblies were directly separated by their topology. Rapid automated analysis of the makeup of the complex samples was achieved without individual peak assignment. The dataset was parsed for assembly activity without first attempting to structurally assign individual species.







Abstract
Embracing complexity in design, metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly presents an opportunity for fabricating materials of economic significance. The array of accessible supramolecules is alluring, along with favourable energy requirements. Implementation is hampered by an inability to efficiently characterise complex mixtures. The stoichiometry, size, shape, guest binding properties and reactivity of individual components and combinations thereof are inherently challenging to resolve. A large combinatorial library of four transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn), and six &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligands at different molar ratios and pH was robotically prepared and directly analysed over multiple timepoints with electrospray ionisation travelling wave ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. The dataset was parsed for self&#8208;assembling activity without first attempting to structurally assign individual species. Self&#8208;assembling systems were readily categorised without manual data&#8208;handling, allowing efficient screening of self&#8208;assembly activity. This workflow clarifies solution phase supramolecular assembly processes without manual, bottom&#8208;up processing. The complex behaviour of the self&#8208;assembling systems was reduced to simpler qualities, which could be automatically processed.

         <title>A Homopolymer of Xanthenoxanthene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Heteroaromatic for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting homopolymer, hailing from an electron&#8208;rich peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic monomer, produces uniform films with heightened hole mobility, amplified modulus, and constrained species diffusion. These attributes enable the construction of perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, which also exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational durability.







Abstract
Highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically rely on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole transporter, achieving a 25.7&#8201;% efficiency record. However, these cells are susceptible to harsh 85&#8201;&#176;C conditions. Here, we present a peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based semiconducting homopolymer (p&#8208;TNI2) with matched energy levels and a high molecular weight, synthesized nearly quantitatively through facile oxidative polymerization. Compared to established materials, p&#8208;TNI2 excels in hole mobility, morphology, modulus, and waterproofing. Implementing p&#8208;TNI2 as the hole transport layer results in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, rivaling 24.4&#8201;% for the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD control cells under identical conditions. Furthermore, the p&#8208;TNI2&#8208;based cells exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational robustness.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free 1,3&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement to Ketones Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 1,3&#8208;boronate rearrangement to ketones is reported. The reaction is driven by visible light irradiation, leading to various &#946;&#8208;keto tertiary alcohols under metal&#8208;free conditions. The excited state overcomes the energy barrier for the rearrangement, and mechanistic studies have excluded a free&#8208;radical reaction pathway.







Abstract
Boronate rearrangements, such as the Matteson and Petasis reactions, are valuable metal&#8208;free reactions for the transfer of the carbo group on boron to intramolecular electrophilic sites. However, only highly reactive electrophiles are suitable, and ketones are too inactive for those boronate rearrangements due to the high energy barriers. We disclose here the 1,3&#8208;boronate rearrangement to ketones, for which a high energy barrier (44.9&#8197;kcal/mol) is prohibitory for thermal reactions in the ground state. The reaction is enabled by the key keto&#8208;enol&#8208;boronate bidentate complex formation in situ, which absorbs visible light to reach the excited state for the chemoselective 1,3&#8208;boronate rearrangement to ketones. Experimental and computational investigations exclude free radical intermediates from organoboronates. The aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl boronic acids react with various 1,3&#8208;diketones driven by visible light irradiation to construct structurally diverse &#946;&#8208;keto tertiary alcohols under metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction demonstrates substrate diversity with 58 examples, yields up to 98&#8201;%, and it is suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>A donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymer for fast storage of anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer is reported, showing narrower band gap and higher electrical conductivity than its counterparts monopolymers and therefore excellent rate performance. Our findings provide a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have attracted a lot interest in batteries in recent years. However, most of them still suffer from low performance such as low electrode potential, slow reaction kinetics, and short cycle life. In this work, we report a strategy of fabricating donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers for facilitating the charge transfer and therefore accelerating the reaction kinetics by using the copolymer (p&#8208;TTPZ) of dihydrophenazine (PZ) and thianthrene (TT) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p&#8208;type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p&#8208;TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.

         <title>The Design of a Participatory Peptide Nucleic Acid Duplex Crosslinker to Enhance the Stiffness of Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of crosslinking agents to modulate the mechanical properties of peptide&#8208;based gels increases their scope of utility. We report the design, synthesis and utilization of a peptide nucleic acid duplex crosslinker (DCL) that takes part in peptide assembly leading to gel formation while simultaneously installing non&#8208;covalent crosslinks into the higher&#8208;order fibrillar network. DCL represents a new modality in the crosslinker arsenal.







Abstract
Herein, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are employed in the design of a participatory duplex PNA&#8208;peptide crosslinking agent. Biophysical and mechanical studies show that crosslinkers present during peptide assembly leading to hydrogelation participate in the formation of fibrils while simultaneously installing crosslinks into the higher&#8208;order network that constitutes the peptide gel. The addition of 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% crosslinker into the assembling system results in a ~100&#8201;% increase in mechanical stiffness without affecting the rate of peptide assembly or the local morphology of fibrils within the gel network. Stiffness enhancement is realized by only affecting change in the elastic component of the viscoelastic gel. A synthesis of the PNA&#8208;peptide duplex crosslinkers is provided that allows facile variation in peptide composition and addresses the notorious hydrophobic content of PNAs. This crosslinking system represents a new tool for modulating the mechanical properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Activation of a Microtubule Polymerization Inhibitor via Amide Functionalization of the Ruthenium Photocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamide functionalization of a green light&#8208;sensitive photoactivated chemotherapy agent based on ruthenium fine&#8208;tuned its excited states, dramatically improving red light absorption. The new prodrug inhibited microtubule polymerization under red light activation, efficiently killing cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, red light activation shrank non&#8208;melanoma skin tumors in mice, while in the dark the prodrug showed improved biosafety.







Abstract
Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that kills cancer cells via photochemical uncaging of a cytotoxic drug. Most ruthenium&#8208;based photocages used for PACT are activated with blue or green light, which penetrates sub&#8208;optimally into tumor tissues. Here, we report amide functionalization as a tool to fine&#8208;tune the toxicity and excited states of a terpyridine&#8208;based ruthenium photocage. Due to conjugation of the amide group with the terpyridine &#960; system in the excited state, the absorption of red light (630&#8197;nm) increased 8&#8208;fold, and the photosubstitution rate rose 5&#8208;fold. In vitro, red light activation triggered inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which led to apoptotic cell death both in normoxic (21&#8201;% O2) and hypoxic (1&#8201;% O2) cancer cells. In vivo, red light irradiation of tumor&#8208;bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction (45&#8201;%) with improved biosafety, thereby demonstrating the clinical potential of this compound.

         <title>Hydrophobic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Si Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices, is a key focus in achieving the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. In this study, we initially designed poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) with varying alkyl chain lengths based on density functional theory calculations. Results pinpoint that PILs with longer alkyl chain lengths tend to exhibit more robust binding energy with the perovskite structure. Then we synthesized the PILs to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network (HHPN) that passivates the WBG perovskite/electron transport layer interface, inhibits ion migration and serves as a barrier layer against water and oxygen ingression. Accordingly, the HHPN effectively curbs nonradiative recombination losses while facilitating efficient carrier transport, resulting in substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor. As a result, the optimized single&#8208;junction WBG PSC achieves an impressive efficiency of 23.18%, with VOC as high as 1.25 V, which is&#160;the highest reported for WBG (over 1.67 eV) PSCs. These devices also demonstrate outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. Notably, this versatile strategy can be extended to textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 28.24% while maintaining exceptional operational stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Pyridines via a Nitrene Internalization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridines are valuable pharmacophores, and their access via direct and selective transmutation of carbon atom with desired nitrogen could become crucial in drug discovery processes. However, very little has been witnessed in such C&#8208;to&#8208;N&#8208;transmutation reactions of aromatics that could lead to facile synthesis of pyridines or higher azaarenes. In this context, Levin and co&#8208;workers recently disclosed a process for procuring pyridines from the corresponding aryl azides via the regioselective nitrene internalization process without perturbing the rest of the aromatic skeleton. This innovative work enabled access to various pyridine derivatives selectively through direct nitrogen scan operations on benzene derivatives, which otherwise was not feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Construction of a Polar Material Exhibiting Strong Broad&#8208;Spectrum Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considerable effort has been invested in the development of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) inorganic solids for ferroelectricity&#8208;, piezoelectricity&#8208; and, particularly, optical nonlinearity&#8208;related applications. While great progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty in constructing NCS materials, which probably stems from non&#8208;directionality and unsaturation of the ionic bonds between metal counter&#8208;cations and covalent anionic modules. We report herein a secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven approach that circumvents the cancellation of dipole moments between adjacent anionic modules that has plagued second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) material design, and which thereby affords a polar structure with strong SHG properties. The resultant first NCS counter&#8208;cation&#8208;free iodate, VO2(H2O)(IO3) (VIO), a new class of iodate, crystallizes in a polar lattice with VO2(H2O)(IO3)] zigzag chains connected by weak hydrogen bonds and intermolecular forces. VIO exhibits very large SHG responses (18 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1200 nm, 1.5 &#215; KTiOPO4 @ 2100 nm) and sufficient birefringence (0.184 @ 546 nm). Calculations and crystal structure analysis attribute the large SHG responses to consistent polarization orientations of the VO2(H2O)(IO3)] chains controlled by secondary bonds. This study highlights the advantages of manipulating the secondary bonds in inorganic solids to control NCS structure and optical nonlinearity, affording a new perspective in the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Numerous reported bioinspired osmotic energy conversion systems employing cation&#8208;/ anion&#8208;selective membrane and solutions with different salinity are actually far from the biological counterpart. The iso&#8208;osmotic power generator with the specific ionic permselective channels (e.g., K+&#160;or Na+&#160;channels) which just allow specific ions get across and iso&#8208;osmotic solutions still remain challenges. Inspired by nature, we report a bioinspired K+&#8208;channel by employing a K+&#160;selective ligand, 1,1,1&#8208;tris{[(2&#8217;&#8208;benzylaminoformyl)phenoxy]methyl}ethane (BMP) and graphene oxide membrane. Specifically, the&#160;K+&#160;and Na+selectivity of&#160;the prepared system could reach up to ~17.8, and the molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the excellent permselectivity of K+&#160;is mainly stemmed from the formed suitable channel size. Thus, we assembled the K+&#8208;selective iso&#8208;osmotic power generator (KSIPG) with the power density up to ~15.1 mW/m2&#160;between equal concentration solutions, which is higher than traditional charge&#8208;selective osmotic power generator (CSOPG). The proposed strategy has well shown the realizable approach to construct&#160;single&#8208;ion selective channels&#8208;based highly efficient iso&#8208;osmotic energy conversion systems and would surely inspire new applications in other fields, including self&#8208;powered system and medical materials, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Photosensitizer with High Enrichment in Tumor Cells Based on a Multi&#8208;effect Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probes and photosensitizers (PSs) have emerged as promising tools for molecular imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, living organisms, especially animals, are highly dynamic systems; selective retention or even enrichment of these reagents after enzymatic activation at or near sites of interest remains a challenging task. Herein, we integrate the non&#8208;covalent and covalent retention approaches to introduce a novel &#8220;1&#8208;to&#8208;3&#8221; multi&#8208;effect strategy &#8212; one enzyme stimulus leads to three types of effects &#8212; for the design of enzyme&#8208;activatable NIR probe or PS. Using this strategy, we have constructed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;activatable NIR fluorogenic probe and a NIR PS, both of which proved to be selectively activated by ALP to switch on NIR fluorescence or photosensitizing ability. Additionally, these reagents resulted in significant enrichment (over 2000&#8208;fold) in ALP&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, accompanied by massive depletion of intracellular thiols, the major antioxidants in cells. The investigation of this ALP&#8208;activatable NIR PS in in vivo PDT resulted in complete suppression of HeLa tumors and full recovery of all tested mice. Encouragingly, even a single PDT with this NIR PS was sufficient to completely suppress tumors in mice, demonstrating the high potential of this strategy in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Zn Atoms with Acetate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Enabled Asymmetric Coordination for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring unique single&#8208;atom sites capable of efficiently reducing O2 to H2O2 while being inert to H2O2 decomposition under light conditions is significant for H2O2 photosynthesis, but it remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile design and fabrication of polymeric carbon nitride (CN) decorated with single&#8208;Zn sites that have tailorable local coordination environments, which is enabled by utilizing different Zn salt anions. Specifically, the O atom from acetate (OAc) anion participates in the coordination of single&#8208;Zn sites on CN, forming asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3O moiety on CN (denoted as CN/ZnOAc), in contrast to the obtained Zn&#8208;N4 sites when sulfate (SO4) is adopted (CN/Zn&#8208;SO4). Both experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Zn&#8208;N3O moiety exhibits higher intrinsic activity for O2 reduction to H2O2 than the Zn&#8208;N4 moiety. This is attributed to the asymmetric N/O coordination, which promotes the adsorption of O2 and the formation of the key intermediate *OOH on Zn sites due to their modulated electronic structure. Moreover, it is inactive for H2O2 decomposition under both dark and light conditions. As a result, the optimized CN/Zn&#8208;OAc catalyst exhibits significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrimination of Disaccharide Isomers of Different Glycosidic Linkages Using a Modified MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide subunits joined by a glycosidic linkage in an &#945; or &#946; configuration. Different combinations of isomeric monosaccharide subunits and different glycosidic linkages result in different isomeric disaccharide products. Thus, direct discrimination of these disaccharide isomers from a mixture is extremely difficult. In this paper, a hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore conjugated with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adapter was applied for disaccharide sensing, with which three most widely known disaccharides in nature, including sucrose, lactose and maltose, were clearly discriminated. Besides, all six isomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;fructoses, differing only in their glycosidic linkages, were also well resolved. Assisted by a custom machine learning algorithm, a 0.99 discrimination accuracy is achieved. Nanopore discrimination of disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages, which has never been previously demonstrated, is inspiring for nanopore saccharide sequencing. This sensing capacity was also applied in direct identification of isomaltulose additives in a commercial sucrose&#8208;free yogurt, from which isomaltulose, lactose and L&#8208;lactic acid were simultaneously detected.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly for Controlling over Helical Nanostructures and Topochemical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly, in which a single building block forms two or more types of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures, is an important topic due to its mimic to the complexity in biology and manipulation of diverse supramolecular materials. Here, we report a pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly using chiral glutamide derivatives (L or D&#8208;PAG), which form chiral nanotwist and nanotube through a cooperative slow cooling and an isodesmic fast cooling process, respectively. Furthermore, pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly can be harnessed to control over the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of PAG with a luminophore &#946;&#8208;DCS or a photopolymerizable PCDA. Fast cooling leads to the co&#8208;assembled PAG/&#946;&#8208;DCS nanotube exhibiting green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), while slow cooling to nanofiber with blue CPL. &#160;Additionally, fast cooling process promotes the photopolymerization of PCDA into a red chiral polymer, whereas slow cooling inhibits the polymerization. This work not only demonstrates the pathway&#8208;dependent control over structural characteristics but also highlights the diverse functions emerged from the different assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Mechanism in Aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries have attracted extensive attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications, however, the energy storage chemistry of MnO2 in mild acidic aqueous electrolytes remains elusive and controversial. Using &#945;&#8208;MnO2 as a case study, we developed a methodology by coupling conventional coin batteries with customized beaker batteries to pinpoint the operating mechanism of Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries. This approach visually simulates the operating state of batteries in different scenarios and allows for a comprehensive study of the operating mechanism of aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries under mild acidic conditions. It is validated that the electrochemical performance can be modulated by controlling the addition of Mn2+ to the electrolyte. The method is utilized to systematically eliminate the possibility of Zn2+ and/or H+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation reactions, thereby confirming the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. By combining a series of phase and spectroscopic characterizations, the compositional, morphological and structural evolution of electrodes and electrolytes during battery cycling is probed, elucidating the intrinsic battery chemistry of MnO2 in mild acid electrolytes. Such a methodology developed can be extended to other energy storage systems, providing a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries as well.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale&#8208;up application, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant acetone to achieve H2O&#8208;poor solvation structure of Zn2+. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i) relieve the solvated H2O related side reactions, ii) suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+ and iii) in&#8208;situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30 h to more than 800 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2, and can work at more harsh condition of 5 mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2. More encouragingly, Zn/V2O5&#183;nH2O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at ~700th cycle).</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulated Fluoro&#8208;Ether derived Nucleophilic Decomposition Products for Mitigating Polarization&#8208;Induced Capacity Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is a fascinating choice to improve the performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes (LRLO) for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, many existing electrolyte designs and adjustment principles tend to overlook the unique challenges posed by LRLO, particularly the nucleophilic attack. Here, we introduce an electrolyte modification by locally replacing carbonate solvents in traditional electrolytes with a fluoro&#8208;ether. By benefit of the decomposition of fluoro&#8208;ether under nucleophilic O&#8208;related attacks, which delivers an excellent passivation layer with LiF and polymers, possessing rigidity and flexibility on the LRLO surface. More importantly, the fluoro&#8208;ether acts as "sutures", ensuring the integrity and stability of both interfacial and bulk structures, which contributed to suppressing severe polarization and enhancing the cycling capacity retention from 39% to 78% after 300 cycles for the 4.8 V&#8208;class LRLO. This key electrolyte strategy with comprehensive analysis, provides new insights into addressing nucleophilic challenge for high&#8208;energy anionic redox related cathode systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysed&#8208;multicomponent reactions between flue gas CO2 and cheap industrial raw stocks into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals is a promising manner for the ideal CO2 utilization route. To achieve this, the key fundamental challenge is the rational development of highly efficient and facile reaction pathway while establishing compatible catalytic system. Herein, through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, we report the construction of a series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx) [BPY = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate, TPDC&#8208;NH2 = 2'&#8208;amino&#8208;[1,1':4',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4''&#8208;dicarboxylic acid] that can catalyze the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Such assembly endows the MOFs with superhydrophobic microenvironment, superior water resistance and highly stable catalytic site, leading to 21 times higher turnover numbers than that of homogeneous counterparts. Mechanism investigation implied that the substrates can be efficiently enriched by the MOF wall and then the adsorbed amine species act as an extrinsic binding site towards dilute CO2 through their strong preferential formation to carbamate acid. Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggest the tetrahedral geometry of Cu in MOF offers special resistance towards amine poisoning, thus maintaining its high efficiency during the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Functionalization of an Acyclic Methylene&#8208;Bridged&#8208;Arene Trimer in a Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arene&#8208;formaldehyde condensation is a versatile reaction for producing various oligomeric/polymeric materials.&#160; However, the precise control of oligomerization degree is still challenging because the starting materials and intermediates have similar reactivities. Here, we demonstrate the selective synthesis of a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer using the confined cavity of a coordination cage. The limited space of the cavity prevents unregulated polymerization. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent site&#8208;selective iodination of the trimer product within the cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Multicomponent Fluoroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes: Concise Construction of Diverse Cyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions, particularly those entailing four or more reagents, have presented a longstanding challenge due to the inherent complexities associated with balancing reactivity, selectivity, and compatibility. In this study, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were efficiently and selectively integrated in a single chemical operation. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent. This approach also provides a valuable strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of naturally occurring molecules and concise construction of diverse cyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxidation of an iridium(III) oxo precursor enabled the structural, spectroscopic, and quantum&#8208;chemical characterization of the first well&#8208;defined iridium(IV) oxo complex. Side&#8208;by&#8208;side examination of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer thermochemistry revealed similar driving forces for the isostructural oxo complexes in two redox states due to compensating contributions from H+ and e&#8211; transfer. However, C&#8211;H activation of dihydroanthracene revealed significant hydrogen tunnelling for the distinctly more basic iridium(III) oxo complex. Our findings complement the growing body of data that relate tunnelling to ground state properties as predictors for the selectivity of C&#8211;H bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The implementation of supported metal catalysts heavily relies on the synergistic interactions between metal nanoparticles and the material they are dispersed on.&#160;It is clear that interfacial perimeter sites have outstanding skills for turning catalytic reactions over, however, high activity and selectivity of the designed interface&#8208;induced metal distortion can also obtain catalysts for the most crucial industrial processes as evidenced in this paper. Herein, the beneficial synergy established between designed Pt nanoparticles and MnO in the course of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction resulted in a Pt/MnO catalyst having ~10 times higher activity compared to the reference Pt/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst with &gt;99% CO selectivity. Under activation, a crystal assembly through the metallic Pt (110) and MnO evolved, where the plane distance differences caused a mismatched row structure in&#160;softer Pt nanoparticles, which was identified by microscopic and surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic characterizations combined with density functional theory simulations.&#160;The generated edge dislocations caused the Pt lattice expansion which led to the weakening of the Pt&#8208;CO bond. Even though MnO also exhibited an adverse effect on Pt by lowering the number of exposed metal sites, rapid desorption of the linearly adsorbed CO species governed the performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exceptional thermal stability of&#160;diarylethene closed isomers&#160;enabled many applications but also prevented utilization in photochromic systems&#160;that require&#160;rapid thermal&#160;reversibility. Herein, we report the diaryltriazolium (DAT+) photoswitch undergoing thermal cycloreversion within&#160;few&#160;milliseconds&#160;and an absorption of the closed&#160;form in the near&#8208;infrared&#160;region&#160;above 900 nm.&#160;Click chemistry followed by alkylation offer modular and fast access to the electron&#8208;deficient&#160;DAT+&#160;scaffold. In addition to excellent fatigue resistance, the introduced charge increases water solubility, rendering this photoswitch an ideal candidate for exploring biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting &#960; and Chalcogen Interactions for the &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylation of Indoles through Glycal Conformational Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) is emerging as a formidable synthetic approach into difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access glycosidic chemical space. C&#8208;glycosylation, amongst all, has gained a flurry of recent attention. However, most reported methods are restricted to the relatively facile access of &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides. Herein, we disclose a &#946;&#8208;stereoselective glycosylation of indoles by employing a phosphonoselenide catalyst. The robustness of this protocol is exemplified by its amenability at both the indolyl C&#8208; and N&#8208;reactivity sites. In contrast to previous reports where the chalcogens were solely involved in Lewis acidic activation, our mechanistic investigation unraveled that the often neglected flanking aromatic substituents of phosphonoselenides can substantially contribute to catalysis by engaging in &#960;&#8208;interactions. Computations and NMR indicated that the chalcogenic and aromatic components of the catalyst can be collectively exploited to foster conformational distortion of the glycal away from the usual half chair to the boat conformation, which liberates the convex &#946;&#8208;face for nucleophilic attack.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Disbiradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradicals, in which the radical sites exist as individual spin doublets with weak spin&#8208;spin interaction have not been known so far. Starting from monoradicals of the type [&#8226;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8211;R], we have now succeeded in linking two such monoradical phosphorus centers by appropriate choice of a linker. To this end, biradical [&#8226;P(&#956;&#8209;NTer)2P&#8226;] (1) was treated with 1,6&#8208;dibromo&#173;hexane, affording the brominated species {Br[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (3). Subsequent reduction with KC8 led to the formation of the disbiradical {&#8226;[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (4) featuring a large distance between the radical phosphorus sites in the solid state and formally the highest biradical character observed in a P&#8208;centered biradical so far, approaching 100%. EPR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;line signal in solution with a considerably larger exchange interaction than would be expected from the molecular structure of the single crystal. Quantum chemical calculations revealed a highly dynamic conformational space; thus, the two radical sites can approach each other with a much smaller distance in solution. Further reduction of 4 resulted in the formation of a potassium salt featuring the first structurally characterized P&#8208;centered distonic radical anion (5&#8211;). Moreover, 4 could be used in small molecule activation.</dc:description>

A total number of 23 different compounds was isolated from these enzyme reactions and structurally characterised, if possible including the experimental determination of absolute configurations through a stereoseletive deuteration approach.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isoxeniolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoxeniolide A is a highly strained xenicane diterpenoid of marine origin. This natural product is representative for a subfamily of xenicanes incorporating an allylic hydroxy group in the 9&#8208;membered ring; members of this xenicane subfamily so far have not been targeted by total synthesis. Here, we describe the first asymmetric total synthesis of isoxeniolide A. Key to forming the challenging E&#8208;configured cyclononene ring was a diastereoselective intramolecular Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi reaction. Other important transformations include an enzymatic desymmetrization for absolute stereocontrol, a diastereoselective cuprate addition and the use of a bifunctional vinyl silane building block. Our strategy also permits access to the enantiomer of the natural product and holds potential to access a multitude of xenicane natural products and of analogs for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Substrate Specificity and Mechanistic Variability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates is summarized in this review article from the perspective of substrate specificity and mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation finds widespread application in academia and industry. And indeed, a number of processes have been implemented for the production of pharma and agro intermediates as well as flavors &amp; fragrances. Although these processes are all based on the use of late transition metals as catalysts, there is an increasing interest in the use of base metal catalysis in view of their lower cost and the expected different substrate scope. Catalysts based on cobalt have already shown their potential in enantioselective hydrogenation chemistry. This review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years on cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of different unsaturated substrates. We also illustrate the ligand dependent substrate specificity as well as the mechanistic variability in detail. This may well guide further catalyst development in this research area.

We also illustrate the ligand dependent substrate specificity as well as the mechanistic variability in detail. This may well guide further catalyst development in this research area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Ammonia Oxidation on BiVO4 Photoanodes Co&#8208;catalyzed by Trace Amounts of Copper Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply introduing trace amounts of Cu ions into ammonia solutions can substantially improve the photoelectrochemical performance for ammonia oxidation reaction on BiVO4 photoanodes, which originates from the activation of N&#8722;H bonds via the cooperation of BiVO4 surface effect and Cu&#8208;induced coordination effect. This simple activation strategy is also applicable to other (photo)electrocatalysts for ammonia oxidation reaction.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficient photoelectrocatalytic direct ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) conducted on semiconductor photoanodes remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we develop a strategy of simply introducing ppm levels of Cu ions (0.5&#8211;10&#8197;mg/L) into NH3 solutions to significantly improve the AOR photocurrent of bare BiVO4 photoanodes from 3.4 to 6.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE, being close to the theoretical maximum photocurrent of BiVO4 (7.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The surface charge&#8208;separation efficiency has reached 90&#8201;% under a low bias of 0.8&#8197;VRHE. This AOR exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8&#8201;% with the water oxidation reaction (WOR) being greatly suppressed. N2 is the main AOR product with FEs of 71.1&#8201;% in aqueous solutions and FEs of 100&#8201;% in non&#8208;aqueous solutions. Through mechanistic studies, we find that the formation of Cu&#8722;NH3 complexes possesses preferential adsorption on BiVO4 surfaces and efficiently competes with WOR. Meanwhile, the cooperation of BiVO4 surface effect and Cu&#8208;induced coordination effect activates N&#8722;H bonds and accelerates the first rate&#8208;limiting proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer for AOR. This simple strategy is further extended to other photoanodes and electrocatalysts.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanism for alcohol electrooxidation on nickel&#8208;based electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced adsorbed oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (VO&#8208;AOM) is essential to the electrooxidation of R&#8722;CHOH&#8722;CH2OH to R&#8722;COOH and HCOOH (VDOR) over nickel&#8208;based catalysts, especially for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage process.







Abstract
Owing to outstanding performances, nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts are commonly used in electrochemical alcohol oxidation reactions (AORs), and the active phase is usually vacancy&#8208;rich nickel oxide/hydroxide (NiOxHy) species. However, researchers are not aware of the catalytic role of atom vacancy in AORs. Here, we study vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanisms for AORs on NiOxHy species. As to AORs on oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;poor &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, the only redox mediator is electrooxidation&#8208;induced electrophilic lattice oxygen species, which can only catalyze the dehydrogenation process (e.g., the electrooxidation of primary alcohol to carboxylic acid) instead of the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Hence, vicinal diol electrooxidation reaction involving the C&#8722;C bond cleavage is not feasible with oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;poor &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. Only through oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced adsorbed oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism, can oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich NiOxHy species catalyze the electrooxidation of vicinal diol to carboxylic acid and formic acid accompanied with the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Crucially, we examine how vacancies and vacancy&#8208;induced catalytic mechanisms work during AORs on NiOxHy species.

         <dc:description>
Round and round&#8230; The intrinsic dynamics of small&#8208;molecule ligands while bound to their protein targets is of interest for optimization of the entropic contributions to binding affinity. In their Communication (e202313947), Rasmus Linser et&#8197;al. show that NMR proton relaxation dispersion is able to capture an aromatic ring flip within a high&#8208;affinity pharmacological inhibitor on the &#956;s timescale.

Nanochannels with spatiotemporal continuity were found to exist in columnar liquid crystals composed of shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic molecules as reported by Kentaro Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316523). The results of 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of the liquid crystal under Xe atmosphere indicate the encapsulation of Xe gas atoms within the discrete and oriented nanochannels of the nanoporous liquid crystals.

         <dc:description>
Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination is reported by Jun Li, Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202313491). The unexpected coordination, which is different from the common organo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination, serves single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered Pd nanoclusters with exceptional stability. Furthermore, the dominant horizontal electron transition induces strong optical absorption and promising photothermal conversion efficiency of the Pd8&#160;nanocluster with well&#8208;defined composition and structure.

         <dc:description>
A unique system for the realization of orthogonal multimode photopatterning, including holographic, fluorescent, and photochromic patterning, has been demonstrated based on a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle. This concept opens new avenues to the design of optical storage devices for information storage, encryption, and anticounterfeiting, as explained by Haiyan Peng, Lin Xu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202315061).

         <title>Photochemical Deoxygenative Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes Promoted by a Nucleophilic Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct utilization of simple and abundant feedstocks in carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions to embellish sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is highly desirable. Herein, we report a novel photochemical deoxygenative hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with readily available carboxylic acid derivatives. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, accommodating carboxylic acid&#8208;, alcohol&#8208;, ester&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, amide&#8208;, silane&#8208;, and boronic ester groups, as well as nitrile&#8208;containing substrates. The reaction is operationally simple, mild, and water&#8208;tolerant, and can be carried out on multigram&#8208;scale, which highlights the utility of the method to prepare value&#8208;added compounds in a practical and scalable manner. The synthetic application of the developed method is further exemplified through the synthesis of suberanilic acid, a precursor of vorinostat, a drug used for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. A novel mechanistic approach was identified using thiol as a nucleophilic catalyst, which forms a key intermediate for this transformation. Furthermore, electrochemical studies, quantum yield, and mechanistic experiments were conducted to support a proposed catalytic cycle for the transformation</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Control of Proteasomal Protein Degradation with a Photoswitchable Lipopeptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photolipids have emerged as attractive tools for the optical control of lipid functions. They often contain an azobenzene photoswitch that imparts a cis double&#8208;bond upon irradiation. Herein, we present the application of photoswitching to a lipidated natural product, the potent proteasome inhibitor cepafungin I. Several azobenzene&#8208;containing lipids were attached to the cyclopeptide core, yielding photoswitchable derivatives. Most notably, PhotoCep4 exhibited a 10&#8208;fold higher cellular potency in its light&#8208;induced cis&#8208;form, matching the potency of natural cepafungin I. The length of the photolipid tail and distal positioning of the azobenzene photoswitch with respect to the macrocycle is critical for this activity. In a proteome&#8208;wide experiment, light&#8208;triggered PhotoCep4 modulation showed high overlap with constitutively active cepafungin I. The mode of action was studied using crystallography and revealed an identical binding of the cyclopeptide in comparison to cepafungin I, suggesting that differences in their cellular activity originate from switching the tail structure. The photopharmacological approach described herein could be applicable to many other natural products as lipid conjugation is common and often necessary for potent activity. Such lipids are often introduced late in synthetic routes, enabling facile chemical modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Ferrocene Quencher&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanomedicine for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time monitoring of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation is crucial for both the efficacy and safety of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although &#8226;OH probe&#8208;integrated CDT agents can track &#8226;OH production by themselves, they often require complicated synthetic procedures and suffer from self&#8208;consumption of &#8226;OH. Here, we report the facile fabrication of a self&#8208;monitored chemodynamic agent (denoted as Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) by incorporating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via host&#8208;guest molecular recognition. The water&#8208;soluble CD served not only as a capping agent to protect AuNCs but also as a macrocyclic host to encapsulate and solubilize hydrophobic Fc guest with high Fenton reactivity for in vivo CDT applications. Importantly, the encapsulated Fc inside CD possessed strong electron&#8208;donating ability to effectively quench the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence of AuNCs through photoinduced electron transfer. After internalization of Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs by cancer cells, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused Fc oxidation and subsequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, which was accompanied by the formation of cytotoxic &#8226;OH and therefore allowed Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to in situ self&#8208;report &#8226;OH generation without undesired &#8226;OH consumption. Such a NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored CDT enabled the use of renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs for efficient tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described here is a direct entry to two the first examples of 3d transition metal catalysts that are active for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene, namely, [(BDI)M{k2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (2&#8208;M) (BDI = [ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M = Ti, V). Catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of [(BDI)MCl2] with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)]. Complexes 2&#8208;M have been spectroscopically and structurally characterized and the polymers that are catalytically formed from phenylacetylene were verified to have a cyclic topology based on a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) and intrinsic viscosity studies. Two&#8208;electron oxidation of 2&#8208;V with nitrous oxide cleanly yields a [VV] alkylidene&#8208;alkynyl oxo complex [(BDI)V(=O){k1&#8208;C&#8208;(=C(SiMe3)CC(SiMe3&#173;&#173;&#173;))}] (3), which lends support for how this scaffold in 2&#8208;M might be operating in the polymerization of the terminal alkyne. This work demonstrates how alkylidynes can be circumvented using 1,3&#8208;dianionic allene as a segue into M&#8211;C multiple bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Electrochemical Sulfion Oxidation with CO2 Reduction&#160;over Highly Dispersed p&#8208;Bi Nanosheets and CO2&#8208;Assisted Sulfur Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an electrocatalytic CO2 reduction&#8208;coupled sulfion oxidation system for the co&#8208;productions of valuable formate and sulfur at much enhanced atom utilization. Specifically, an organic ligand&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step reconstruction approach has been developed to fabricate the highly dispersed p&#8208;Bi nanosheets (p&#8208;Bi NSs) for cathodic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and meanwhile porous Co&#8208;S nanosheets (Co&#8208;S NSs) was applied for anodic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR). Significantly high Faradaic Efficiencies of ~90% for formate production by CO2RR in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6 V to &#8722;1.1 V, and excellent SOR performances including an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of ~0.2 V and recycle capacity&#160;of S2&#8722; in the 0.1 M and 0.5 M S2&#8722; solutions, have been simultaneously achieved. In the meantime, both the structure transformation of the catalysts and the reaction pathways are explored and discussed in detail. A two&#8208;electrode CO2RR||SOR electrolyzer equipped with above electrocatalysts has been established, which features as low as ~1.5 V to run the electrolyzer at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, manifesting extremely lowered electricity consumption in comparison to conventional CO2RR system. Moreover, a sulfur separation approach has been proposed by using CO2, which is efficient, environmentally friendly and cost effective with value&#8208;added NaHCO3 be obtained as the byproduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Self&#8208;Assembly: From Passive to Active Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal self&#8208;assembly allows for the formation of diverse intricate structures assembling in natural systems. This Minireview compares the key similarities and differences between passive and active systems and highlights the unique collective behaviors and emergent properties that arise in active systems.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly fundamentally implies the organization of small sub&#8208;units into large structures or patterns without the intervention of specific local interactions. This process is commonly observed in nature, occurring at various scales ranging from atomic/molecular assembly to the formation of complex biological structures. Colloidal particles may serve as micrometer&#8208;scale surrogates for studying assembly, particularly for the poorly understood kinetic and dynamic processes at the atomic scale. Recent advances in colloidal self&#8208;assembly have enabled the programmable creation of novel materials with tailored properties. We here provide an overview and comparison of both passive and active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, with a discussion on the energy landscape and interactions governing both types. In the realm of passive colloidal assembly, many impressive and important structures have been realized, including colloidal molecules, one&#8208;dimensional chains, two&#8208;dimensional lattices, and three&#8208;dimensional crystals. In contrast, active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, driven by optical, electric, chemical, or other fields, involves more intricate dynamic processes, offering more flexibility and potential new applications. A comparative analysis underscores the critical distinctions between passive and active colloidal assemblies, highlighting the unique collective behaviors emerging in active systems. These behaviors encompass collective motion, motility&#8208;induced phase segregation, and exotic properties arising from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics. Through this comparison, we aim to identify the future opportunities in active assembly research, which may suggest new application domains.

         <title>Multiplying Oxygen Permeability of a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Oxide by Orientation Control via Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide Nd2NiO4+&#948; particles can be aligned in a magnetic field generated by NdFeB magnets. A textured asymmetric membrane prepared in this way exhibited oxygen flux five times higher than a conventional membrane. In contrast to perovskite oxides, the material also showed excellent CO2&#8208;stability highlighted by an O2 flux of 1.4&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#8197;h at 1223&#8197;K under pure CO2 sweeping.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;type oxides exhibit remarkable chemical stability in comparison to perovskite oxides. However, they display lower oxygen permeability. We present an approach to overcome this trade&#8208;off by leveraging the anisotropic properties of Nd2NiO4+&#948;. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field (0.81 T). A stable and high oxygen flux of 1.40&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved for at least 120&#8197;h at 1223&#8197;K by a textured asymmetric disk membrane with 1.0&#8197;mm thickness under the pure CO2 sweeping. Its excellent operational stability was also verified even at 1023&#8197;K in pure CO2. These findings highlight the significant enhancement in oxygen permeation membrane performance achievable by adjusting the grain orientation. Consequently, Nd2NiO4+&#948; emerges as a promising candidate for industrial applications in air separation, syngas production, and CO2 capture under harsh conditions.

         <title>Enhanced Light&#8208;Harvesting and Energy Transfer in Carbon Dots Embedded Thylakoids for Photonic Hybrid Capacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;powered zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) based on natural thylakoids (Thy) and fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) was developed for simultaneous light harvesting and energy storage. With emission reabsorption and FRET derived from CDs by thylakoids, the hybrid thylakoids exhibited enhanced bioelectricity generation. As a result, the CDs/Thy&#8208;based ZHC shows a remarkable photo&#8208;charging voltage response of &#8776;1.2&#8197;V.







Abstract
Nanohybrid photosystems have advantages in converting solar energy into electricity, while natural photosystems based solar&#8208;powered energy&#8208;storage device is still under developed. Here, we fabricate a new kind of photo&#8208;rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) benefiting from light&#8208;harvesting carbon dots (CDs) and natural thylakoids for realizing solar energy harvesting and storage simultaneously. Under solar light irradiation, the embedded CDs in thylakoids (CDs/Thy) can convert the less absorbed green light into highly absorbed red light for thylakoids, besides, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CDs and Thy also occurs, which facilitates the photoelectrons generation during thylakoids photosynthesis, thereby resulting in 6&#8208;fold photocurrent output in CDs/Thy hybrid photosystem, compared to pristine thylakoids. Using CDs/Thy as the photocathode in ZHCs, the photonic hybrid capacitor shows photoelectric conversion and storage features. CDs can improve the photo&#8208;charging voltage response of ZHCs to &#8776;1.2&#8197;V with a remarkable capacitance enhancement of 144&#8201;% under solar light. This study provides a promising strategy for designing plant&#8208;based photonic and electric device for solar energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction to Formate or&#160;CO with High Selectivity over a Covalent Organic Framework Covalently Anchored on Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely studied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, pristine COFs usually exhibit low catalytic efficiency owing to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this study, we fabricated a stable COF&#8208;based composite (GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co) by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, in absolute acetonitrile (CH3CN), GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co shows a high selectivity of 94.4% for the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, with a formate yield of 15.8 mmol/g, which is approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. By contrast, in CH3CN/H2O (v:v = 4:1), the main product for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction over GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co is CO (96.1%), with a CO yield as high as 52.2 mmol/g, which is also approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. Photoelectrochemical experiments demonstrate the covalent bonding of COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and GO to form the GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co composite facilitates charge separation and transfer significantly, thereby accounting for the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, theoretical calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal H2O can stabilize the *COOH intermediate to further form a *CO intermediate via O&#8208;H(aq)&#183;&#183;&#183;O(*COOH) hydrogen bonding, thus explaining the regulated photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Friedel&#8211;Crafts Acylation for Accessing Multi&#8208;Bridge&#8208;Functionalized Large Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pillar[n]arenes can be constructed using a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation process. However, due to the reversible nature of the alkylation, mixture of large pillar[n]arenes (n &#8805; 7) are obtained as minor products, and thus laborious purification are necessary to isolate the larger pillar[n]arenes. Moreover, inert methylene bridges are introduced during the alkylation process, and the multi&#8208;functionalization of the bridges has never been fully investigated. Herein, an irreversible Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation is used to prepare pillar[n]arenes. Due to the irreversible nature of the acylation, reaction of precursors bearing carboxylic acids and electron&#8208;rich arene rings results in a size&#8208;exclusive formation of pillar[n]arenes, in which the ring&#8208;size is determined by the precursor length. Because of this size&#8208;selective formation, laborious separation of undesired macrocycles is not necessary. Moreover, the bridges of pillar[n]arenes are selectively installed with reactive carbonyl groups using the acylation method, whose positions are determined by the precursor used. The carbonyl bridges can be easily converted to versatile functional groups, leading to various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes, which cannot be accessed by the alkylation strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible Synthesis of Polypropionates via Diastereodivergent Reductive Ring&#8208;Opening of Trisubstituted Secondary Glycidols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Polypropionates, characterized by their alternating sequence of stereocenters bearing methyl&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;groups, are structurally diverse natural products of utmost importance.[1] Herein, we introduce a novel concept approach towards polypropionate synthesis featuring a diastereodivergent reductive epoxide&#8208;opening as a key step. Readily available and stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols serve as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks with three or more consecutive stereocenters. Stereodiversification is accomplished by an unprecedented mechanism&#8208;control over the stereochemically complimentary modification of the epoxide&#8217;s tertiary C&#8208;atom with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Since our method is not only suited for the preparation of specific targets but also for compound libraries, it will have a great impact on polypropionate synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrated [3+2] Cyclotelomerization of Butafulvenes to Create Multiple Contiguous Fully Substituted Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of multiple continuous fully substituted carbon centers, which serve as unique structural motif in natural products, is a challenging topic in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes to create contiguous fully substituted carbon backbone. In the presence of scandium triflate, all&#8208;carbon skeleton with spiro fused tricyclic ring can be constructed in high diastereoselectivity by utilizing butafulvene as the synthon. Mechanistic studies suggest that this atom&#8208;economic reaction probably proceeds through a synergistic process containing butafulvenes dimerization and nucleophilic attack by water. In addition, the tricyclic product can undergo a series of synthetic derivatizations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy. The recyclability of Sc(OTf)3 has also been demonstrated to show its robust performance in this hydrated cyclotelomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Live Imaging of Osteoclast Activation via Cathepsin K&#160;Activity in Bone Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intravital fluorescence imaging of functional osteoclasts within their intact disease context provides valuable insights into the intricate biology at the microscopic level, facilitating the development of therapeutic approaches for osteoclast&#8208;associated bone diseases. However, there is a lack of studies investigating osteoclast activity within deep&#8208;seated bone lesions using appropriate fluorescent probes, despite the advantages offered by the multi&#8208;photon excitation system in enhancing deep tissue imaging resolution. In this study, we report on the intravital tracking of osteoclast activity in three distinct murine bone disease models. We utilized a cathepsin K (CatK)&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (CatKP1), which exhibited a notable fluorescence turn&#8208;on response in the presence of active CatK. By utilizing CatKP1, we successfully monitored a significant increase in osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones and its attenuation through pharmacological intervention without sacrificing mice. Thus, our findings highlight the efficacy of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for unraveling pathological osteoclast behavior and exploring novel therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Consumer Grade Polyethylene Recycling via Hydrogenolysis on Ultrafine Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogenolysis has the potential to convert high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), which comprises about 30% of plastic waste, into valuable alkanes. Most investigations have focused on increasing activity for lab grade HDPEs displaying low molecular weight, with poor mechanistic understanding of the product distribution. No efficient catalyst is available for consumer grades due to their lower reactivity. This study targets HDPE used in bottle caps, a waste form generated globally at a rate of&#160;approximately&#160;one million units per hour. Ultrafine ruthenium particles (1&#160;nm) supported on titania (anatase) achieved up to 80% conversion into light alkanes (C1&#8208;C45) under mild conditions (498&#160;K, 20&#160;bar H2, 4&#160;h) and were reused for three cycles. Small ruthenium particles were critical to achieving relevant conversions, as activity sharply decreased with size. Selectivity commonalities and peculiarities across HDPE grades were disclosed by a reaction modelling approach applied to products. Isomerization cedes to backbone scission as the reaction progresses. Within this trend, low molecular weight favor isomerization whilst high molecular weight favor cleavage. Commercial caps obeyed this trend with decreased activity, anticipating the influence of additives in realistic processing. This study demonstrates effective hydrogenolysis of consumer grade polyethylene and provides selectivity patterns for product control.</dc:description>

         <title>Iminothioindoxyl Donors with Exceptionally High Cross Section for Protein Vibrational Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various protein functions are related to vibrational energy transfer (VET) as an important mechanism. The underlying transfer pathways can be experimentally followed by ultrafast Vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy with a donor&#8208;sensor pair of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated in a protein. However, so far only one donor ncAA, azulenylalanine (AzAla), exists, which suffers from a comparably low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, we introduce two novel donor ncAAs based on an iminothioindoxyl (ITI) chromophore. The dimethylamino&#8209;ITI (DMA&#8209;ITI) and julolidine&#8209;ITI (J&#173;&#8209;ITI) moieties overcome the limitation of AzAla with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient. While ITI moieties are known for ultrafast photoswitching, DMA&#8208;ITI and J&#8208;ITI exclusively form a hot ground state on the sub&#8208;ps timescale instead, which is essential for their usage as vibrational energy donor. In VET measurements of donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides we investigate the performance of the new donors. We observe 20 times larger signals compared to the established AzAla donor, which opens unprecedented possibilities for the study of VET in proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Degradation in Lithium Ion Batteries With On&#8208;Chip Electrochemistry Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid uptake of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale electric vehicle and energy storage applications requires a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Self&#8208;Relaxation of Asymmetric Coordination in Fe&#8208;based Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Addressing the limitations arising from the consistent catalytic behavior observed for various intermediates during the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses a significant challenge in the optimization of catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by constructing an asymmetric coordination Fe single atom catalyst (SCA) with a dynamically evolved structure. Our catalyst, consisting of a Fe atom coordinated with one S atom and three N atoms (Fe&#8208;S1N3), exhibited exceptional selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02%) and demonstrated a high intrinsic activity (TOF of 7804.34 h&#8208;1), and remarkable stability. Using operando XAFS spectra and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the self&#8208;relaxation of geometric distortion and dynamic evolution of bond lengths within the catalyst. These structure changes enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediate adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CO2RR. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of SACs and paves the way for targeted catalyst designs aimed to disrupt the linear scaling relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium&#8208;based Catalytic Scavengers for Concurrent Scavenging of H2S and Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that plays important roles in redox signaling. H2S overproduction has been linked to a variety of disease states and therefore, H2S&#8208;depleting agents, such as scavengers, are needed to understand the significance of H2S&#8208;based therapy. It is known that elevated H2S can induce oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as in H2S acute intoxication. We explored the possibility of developing catalytic scavengers to simultaneously remove H2S and ROS. Herein, we studied a series of selenium&#8208;based molecules as catalytic H2S/H2O2 scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H2S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as S6 were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma&#8208; and cell lysate&#8208;containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light&#8208;induced H2S removal. These Se&#8208;based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H2S/ROS regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide Ionic Liquids for Safe, Green, and Highly&#8208;Efficient Azidation Reactions to Produce Azide Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;containing materials are widely applied in numerous fields, but always require undesired harsh synthetic conditions. This work establishes a safe, green, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide&#8208;containing materials by designing two novel azide ionic liquids, which can function as both reagents and solvents for highly efficient azidation reactions.







Abstract
Azide compounds are widely used and especially, polymers bearing pendant azide groups are highly desired in numerous fields. However, harsh reaction conditions are always mandatory to achieve full azidation, causing severe side reactions and degradation of the polymers. Herein, we report the design and preparation of two azide ionic liquids (AILs) with azide anion and triethylene glycol (E3)&#8208;containing cation, [P444E3][N3] and [MIME3][N3]. Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN3) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional&#8208;group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E3 moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.

         <title>Photoswitchable Enantioselective and Helix&#8208;Sense Controlled Living Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric PdII/LR&#8722;azo and PdII/LS&#8722;azo could be used as reversible photo&#8208;switchable catalysts for living/controlled polymerization of isocyanide monomers. High enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense polymerization could be observed during the polymerization process.







Abstract
A pair of enantiomeric photoswitchable PdII catalysts, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo, were prepared via the coordination of alkyne&#8208;PdII and azobenzene&#8208;modified phosphine ligands LR&#8722;azo and LS&#8722;azo. Owing to the cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo exhibited different polymerization activities, helix&#8208;sense selectivities, and enantioselectivities during the polymerization of isocyanide monomers under irradiation of different wavelength lights. Furthermore, the achiral isocyanide monomer A&#8208;1 could be polymerized efficiently using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo under dark condition in a living/controlled manner. Further, it generated single right&#8208;handed helical poly&#8208;A&#8208;1m(LR&#8722;azo), confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra and atomic force microscopy images. However, the polymerization of A&#8208;1 almost could not be initiated under 420&#8197;nm light in identical conditions of dark condition. Moreover, the photoswitchable catalyst alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo exhibited high enantioselectivity for the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1, respectively. D&#8208;1 was polymerized preferentially under dark condition with a D&#8208;1/L&#8208;1 rate ratio of 70, yielding single right&#8208;handed polyisocyanides. Additionally, reversible enantioselectivity was observed under 420&#8197;nm light using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo, and the calculated polymerization rate ratio of L&#8208;1/D&#8208;1 was 57 because of the isomerization of the azobenzene moiety of the catalyst. Furthermore, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo showed opposite enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense selectivity during the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1.

   &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt;. Owing to the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety, alkyne-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt; and alkyne-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;S&#8722;&lt;/i&gt;azo&lt;/sup&gt; exhibited different polymerization activities, helix-sense selectivities, and enantioselectivities during the polymerization of isocyanide monomers under irradiation of different wavelength lights. Furthermore, the achiral isocyanide monomer A-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; could be polymerized efficiently using alkyne-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt; under dark condition in a living/controlled manner. Further, it generated single right-handed helical poly-A-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt;), confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra and atomic force microscopy images. However, the polymerization of A-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; almost could not be initiated under 420&#8197;nm light in identical conditions of dark condition. Moreover, the photoswitchable catalyst alkyne-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt; exhibited high enantioselectivity for the polymerization of the racemates of L-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and D-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. D-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was polymerized preferentially under dark condition with a D-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;/L-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; rate ratio of 70, yielding single right-handed polyisocyanides. Additionally, reversible enantioselectivity was observed under 420&#8197;nm light using alkyne-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt;, and the calculated polymerization rate ratio of L-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;/D-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was 57 because of the isomerization of the azobenzene moiety of the catalyst. Furthermore, alkyne-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;azo&lt;/sup&gt; showed opposite enantioselectivity and helix-sense selectivity during the polymerization of the racemates of L-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and D-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafluorogenic Monochromophore&#8208;Type BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazine Series for Dual&#8208;Color Bioorthogonal Imaging with a Single Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of ultrafluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes, employing a monochromophoric strategy to acheive broad&#8208;spectrum fluorogenicity and effective bioorthogonal cellular imaging. These probes showcase a unique turn&#8208;on pattern with BCN and TCO, pioneering dual&#8208;color live&#8208;cell imaging with a single probe.







Abstract
Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.

         <title>A Phosphine&#8208;Amine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Staggered Stacking Structure for Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional COF crystallizes via a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines, featuring an opposite staggered stacking of the interlocked dual layer in a unit cell. Post&#8208;quaternization on phosphazene moieties leads to the exfoliation of the staggered stacking COF into the few&#8208;layer ionized nanosheets, which can decouple lithium salts for rapid solid&#8208;state ion transport.







Abstract
In&#8208;plane ionic conduction over two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials is desirable for flexible electronics. Exfoliating 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards a few layers is highly anticipated, whereas most examples remain robust via &#960;&#8208;stacking against the interlayered dislocation. Herein, we synthesize a phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked 2D COF by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines. The synthesized COF is crystalline, and stacks in an AB&#8208;staggered fashion, wherein the AB dual layers are interlocked by embedding P&#8722;Cl bonds from one to another layer, and the non&#8208;interlocked layers are readily delaminated. Therefore, in situ post&#8208;quaternization over phosphazene can improve the ionization of backbones, accompanied by layered exfoliation. The ultrathin nanosheets can decouple lithium salts for fast solid&#8208;state ion transport, achieving a high conductivity and low activation energy. Our findings explore the P&#8722;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.

         <title>Simultaneous Capture of CO2 Boosting Its Electroreduction in the Micropores of a Metal&#8211;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction occurs in the pores of a porous catalyst possessing CO2 capture sites, which boosts the catalytic performance virtually independent on the CO2 concentration.







Abstract
Integration of CO2 capture capability from simulated flue gas and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) active sites into a catalyst is a promising cost&#8208;effective strategy for carbon neutrality, but is of great difficulty. Herein, combining the mixed gas breakthrough experiments and eCO2RR tests, we showed that an Ag12 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8208;NH2, aka Ag12bpy&#8208;NH2), simultaneously possessing CO2 capture sites as &#8220;CO2 relays&#8221; and eCO2RR active sites, can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2 from simulated flue gas (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;N2=15&#8201;:&#8201;85, at 298&#8197;K), but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2 into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2 conversion of 60&#8201;%. More importantly, its eCO2RR performance (a Faradaic efficiency (CO) of 96&#8201;% with a commercial current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a very low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V for 300&#8197;hours and the full&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 56&#8201;%) under simulated flue gas atmosphere is close to that under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere, and higher than those of all reported catalysts at higher potentials under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere. This work bridges the gap between CO2 enrichment/capture and eCO2RR.

         <title>Mobility&#8208;Modulated Sequential Dissociation Analysis Enables Structural Lipidomics in Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.







Abstract
Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery.

&lt;p&gt;A mobility-modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure-resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Based on the discovered aptamer, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted blockade of the immune suppressor Siglec&#8208;15 (sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15) for cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the developed aptamer&#8208;based immunotherapy amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model by augmenting of macrophage and T cell functionality.







Abstract
The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15 (Siglec&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells and tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, which is mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Siglec&#8208;15 protein/Siglec&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanorods with Five&#8208;Fold Rotational Symmetry and Orientation&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Properties of Their Monomers and Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scattering dissymmetry factor (gs&#8208;factor) peaks of the horizontal chiral Au nanorods are redshifted with higher intensities compared to those of the vertical chiral Au nanorods. The intensity of the chiral response of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side chiral nanorod dimers is reduced because of the coupling between the plasmon resonance modes.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their strong chiroptical responses and broad scientific applications. However, the types of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have remained limited. Herein we report on a new type of chiral nanoparticle, chiral Au nanorod (NR) with five&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which is synthesized using chiral molecules. Three different types of Au seeds (Au elongated nanodecahedrons, nanodecahedrons, and nanobipyramids) are used to study the growth behaviors. Different synthesis parameters, including the chiral molecules, surfactant, reductant, seeds, and Au precursor, are systematically varied to optimize the chiroptical responses of the chiral Au NRs. The chiral scattering measurements on the individual chiral Au NRs and their dimers are performed. Intriguingly, the chiroptical signals of the individual chiral Au NRs and their end&#8208;to&#8208;end dimers are similar, while those of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side dimers are largely reduced. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations reveal that the different chiroptical responses of the chiral NR dimers are originated from the coupling effect between the plasmon resonance modes. Our study enriches chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and provides valuable insight for the design of plasmonic nanostructures with desired chiroptical properties.

A new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) was developed to modify buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSC). The ILC promotes a preferential growth of perovskite along [001] direction and exhibits strong interaction with perovskite to passivate defects. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers an efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.







Abstract
It is found that the disordered growth of bottom perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material to modify the buried interface for regulating the crystal growth and defect passivation is an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here, we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction, while the oriented ILC with mesomorphic phase has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect, as a result, the modified buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>Promoting Syngas to Olefins with Isolated Internal Silanols&#8208;Enriched Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 Aluminosilicate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn2Al3O4 and Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C3&#8211;4= molecules.







Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value&#8208;added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (P/E) and olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with recently approved &#8722;ION structure, composed of 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (MR) extra&#8208;large lobed pores and intersected 10&#8208;MR medium pores, shows a C2&#8211;6= selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high O/P value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with ZnaAlbOx oxide. Moreover, for the high&#8208;silica Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=, resulting in high P/E (&gt;4) and butene/ethylene (B/E &gt;3) ratios. The high C3&#8211;4= selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 zeolite enhances the olefin&#8208;based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) and 1&#8208;hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 promote the desorption of C3&#8211;4=, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.

Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (&lt;i&gt;P/E&lt;/i&gt;) and olefin/paraffin (&lt;i&gt;O/P&lt;/i&gt;) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al-IDM-1 with recently approved &#8722;&lt;b&gt;ION&lt;/b&gt; structure, composed of 17-membered-ring (MR) extra-large lobed pores and intersected 10-MR medium pores, shows a C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high &lt;i&gt;O/P&lt;/i&gt; value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with Zn&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; oxide. Moreover, for the high-silica Al-IDM-1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in high &lt;i&gt;P/E&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;gt;4) and butene/ethylene (&lt;i&gt;B/E&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;3) ratios. The high C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al-IDM-1 zeolite enhances the olefin-based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol-to-propylene (MTP) and 1-hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al-IDM-1 promote the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular insertion strategy is used by introducing non&#8208;covalent interactions in COFs to form a continuous charge transfer channel and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Meanwhile, the enhanced conductivity activates the redox sites in the COF skeleton, resulting in excellent energy storage performance. In addition, the energy storage behavior can be accurately regulated by changing the type of insertion guests.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8722;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8722;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.

         <title>Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;Based Noncovalent Conformational Lock Achieves Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 24 %</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based noncovalently conformational locks for organic HTMs ZS13, which shows good charge transfer properties, thermal stability and passivation function. Perovskite solar cells using ZS13 as doped HTM yield a champion device efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% with good thermal and light stability.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with noncovalently conformational locks (OSNCs) are promising building blocks for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). However, lack of satisfied neighboring building blocks negatively impacts the optoelectronic properties of OSNCs&#8208;based HTMs and imperils the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this limitation, we introduce the benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (BTT) to construct a new OSNC, and the resulting HTM ZS13 shows improved intermolecular charge extraction/transport properties, proper energy level, efficient surface passivation effect. Consequently, the champion devices based on doped ZS13 yield an efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% and 20.95&#8201;% for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1.01&#8197;cm2, respectively. Furthermore, ZS13 shows good thermal stability and the capability of inhibiting I&#8722; ion migration, thus, leading to enhanced device stability. The success in neighboring&#8208;group engineering can triggered a strong interest in developing thienoacene&#8208;based OSNCs toward efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Small Cobalt Nanoparticles Favor Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction Over Methanation Under CO2 Hydrogenation Conditions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small cobalt nanoparticles readily oxidize under CO2 hydrogenation conditions according to X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, favoring reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction, in contrast to larger particles that remain metallic and catalyze methanation.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts are well&#8208;known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co&#8208;NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0&#8197;nm. These SOMC&#8208;derived Co&#8208;NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO2 hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6&#8197;nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8211;3.0&#8197;nm) favor the expected methanation activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water&#8208;gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO2 hydrogenation conditions.

         <title>Tetra&#8208; and Hexavalent Siglec&#8208;8 Ligands Modulate Immune Cell Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siglec&#8208;8 is a potential therapeutic target for eosinophil&#8208; and mast&#8208;cell&#8208;related disorders. With structural modifications and oligo&#8208; to multivalent presentations, the low affinity of the natural ligand was decisively improved. As shown in immune cell assays, a biological effect is not only induced by a multivalent but also by a hexavalent ligand, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, shows only an antagonistic effect.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are generally characterized by poor affinities for their natural glycan ligands, predominantly due to the shallow and solvent&#8208;exposed binding sites. To overcome this drawback, nature has exploited multivalency to strengthen the binding by establishing multiple interactions simultaneously. The development of oligovalent structures frequently proved to be successful, not only for proteins with multiple binding sites, but also for proteins that possess a single recognition domain. Herein we present the syntheses of a number of oligovalent ligands for Siglec&#8208;8, a monomeric I&#8208;type lectin found on eosinophils and mast cells, alongside the thermodynamic characterization of their binding. While the enthalpic contribution of each binding epitope was within a narrow range to that of the monomeric ligand, the entropy penalty increased steadily with growing valency. Additionally, we observed a successful agonistic binding of the tetra&#8208; and hexavalent and, to an even larger extent, multivalent ligands to Siglec&#8208;8 on immune cells and modulation of immune cell activation. Thus, triggering a biological effect is not restricted to multivalent ligands but could be induced by low oligovalent ligands as well, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, showed an antagonistic effect.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution through Local Field Distortion in Mg/Fe Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regulation of the Fe spin state in a Mg&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst is realized by taking advantage of the local crystal field distortion induced by the large ionic radii difference between Fe/Mg. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting.







Abstract
Transition metal single atom electrocatalysts (SACs) with metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) configuration show great potential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the spin&#8208;dependent electrons must be allowed to transfer along reactants (OH&#8722;/H2O, singlet spin state) and products (O2, triplet spin state). Therefore, it is imperative to modulate the spin configuration in M&#8722;N&#8722;C to enhance the spin&#8208;sensitive OER energetics, which however remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a local field distortion induced intermediate to low spin transition by introducing a main&#8208;group element (Mg) into the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C architecture, and decode the underlying origin of the enhanced OER activity. We unveil that, the large ionic radii mismatch between Mg2+ and Fe2+ can cause a FeN4 in&#8208;plane square local field deformation, which triggers a favorable spin transition of Fe2+ from intermediate (dxy2dxz2dyz1dz21, 2.96 &#956;B) to low spin (dxy2dxz2dyz2, 0.95 &#956;B), and consequently regulate the thermodyna&#8208;mics of the elementary step with desired Gibbs free energies. The as&#8208;obtained Mg/Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst demonstrates a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the overall water splitting, which outperforms those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition metal SACs.

         <title>Generation of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Radicals for Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in hydroamination, amidosulfenylation and bromoamination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines serve as important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules. Experimental data on the mechanism are presented.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have been widely recognized as versatile synthetic intermediates for the construction of nitrogen containing molecules of high value. As such, there has been a long&#8208;standing interest in the field of organic synthesis to develop novel nitrogen&#8208;based radicals and explore their inherent reactivity. In this study, we present the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in a novel and diverse functionalization of unactivated alkenes. Bench&#8208;stable aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridinium salts were employed as crucial NCR precursors, which enabled the efficient conversion of various unactivated alkenes into medicinally relevant alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines. This approach offers an unexplored retrosynthetic disconnection for the synthesis of related molecules that commonly possess therapeutic value. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to the synthesis of densely functionalized heterocyclic amines by utilizing disulfides and diethyl bromomalonate as radical quenchers. Mechanistic investigations indicate an energy transfer (EnT) pathway involving the formation of a transient aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radical, radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and subsequent generation of the amination product through either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or radical addition processes.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether was achieved by using single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including internal and terminal alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. Detailed mechanistic studies pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid assisted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.







Abstract
The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8722;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptides Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;terminal&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide has been shown to proceed by multistep structural evolution involving spheres, right&#8208;handed helices and microribbons. A bipyridine derivative was introduced at different stoichiometric ratios to obtain thermodynamically stable chiral nanostructures (right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed helices). Ultrasound and enzyme catalysis are also effective strategies to regulate the chirality.







Abstract
Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, the N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform, which showed that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate into the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted into microribbons. Interestingly, a bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broadens the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of disulfide linkers was established for Cys&#8722;Cys&#8722;(Cys) double/triple click stapling in only 1&#8197;min, bridging from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to deliver 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered locked peptides. The opposite unstapling process proceeded smoothly, making the reversible cross&#8208;linking reagents potentially suitable for peptide delivery.







Abstract
A disulfide click strategy is disclosed for stapling to enhance the metabolic stability and cellular permeability of therapeutic peptides. A 17&#8208;membered library of stapling reagents with adjustable lengths and angles was established for rapid double/triple click reactions, bridging S&#8208;terminal peptides from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to provide 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered macrocyclic peptides under biocompatible conditions. The constrained peptides exhibited enhanced anti&#8208;HCT&#8208;116 activity with a locked &#945;&#8208;helical conformation (IC50=6.81&#8197;&#956;M vs. biological incompetence for acyclic linear peptides), which could be unstapled for rehabilitation of the native peptides under the assistance of tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). This protocol assembles linear peptides into cyclic peptides controllably to retain the diverse three&#8208;dimensional conformations, enabling their cellular uptake followed by release of the disulfides for peptide delivery.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron Regulating Electronic Structure of Iron Atom Clusters for Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst, comprised of oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms and atom clusters anchored onto bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon, was successfully fabricated. This material exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 production and allowed for coupling by an electro&#8208;Fenton process, primarily owing to the active sites of Fe atom clusters with optimized electronic structure regulated by Fe single atoms, resulting in the suitable binding strength of the *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
The integration of highly active single atoms (SAs) and atom clusters (ACs) into an electrocatalyst is critically important for high&#8208;efficiency two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report a tandem impregnation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy to fabricate the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs and ACs anchored on bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (BCC) (FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC). As the electrocatalyst, FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward 2e&#8722; ORR, affording an onset potential of 0.78&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 96.5&#8201;% in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. In a flow cell reactor, the FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC also achieves high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production with a yield rate of 12.51&#177;0.18&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 89.4&#8201;%&#177;1.3&#8201;% at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the feasibility of coupling the produced H2O2 and electro&#8208;Fenton process for the valorization of ethylene glycol was explored in detail. The theoretical calculations uncover that the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs effectively regulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs which are the 2e&#8722; ORR active sites, resulting in the optimal binding strength of *OOH intermediate for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>

A multi&#8208;stage engineering strategy, i.e., the construction of strain&#8208;resistant ultrafine&#8208;grains and subsequent intergranular fluorination of the refined grains synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) cathode, effectively alleviating the structural degradation and gas generation, thereby enabling a long battery life.







Abstract
Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain&#8208;resistant microstructure in Mo&#8208;doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode&#8208;electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo&#8208;doped NC96 cathode by forming an F&#8208;induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery's lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Electrochemistry at Electrodes with Dimensions Commensurable and Smaller than Individual Reacting Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical electrodes made with atomic&#8208;scale precision enable the exploration of angstroms&#8208;scale electrochemistry. Unique features including size effects of reacting species and surface blockade behavior due to the strong species&#8208;electrodes interactions are found dominating electrochemistry at the smallest possible scale.







Abstract
In nature and technologies, many chemical reactions occur at interfaces with dimensions approaching that of a single reacting species in nano&#8208; and angstrom&#8208;scale. Mechanisms governing reactions at this ultimately small spatial regime remain poorly explored because of challenges to controllably fabricate required devices and assess their performance in experiment. Here we report how efficiency of electrochemical reactions evolves for electrodes that range from just one atom in thickness to sizes comparable with and exceeding hydration diameters of reactant species. The electrodes are made by encapsulating graphene and its multilayers within insulating crystals so that only graphene edges remain exposed and partake in reactions. We find that limiting current densities characterizing electrochemical reactions exhibit a pronounced size effect if reactant's hydration diameter becomes commensurable with electrodes&#8217; thickness. An unexpected blockade effect is further revealed from electrodes smaller than reactants, where incoming reactants are blocked by those adsorbed temporarily at the atomically narrow interfaces. The demonstrated angstrom&#8208;scale electrochemistry offers a venue for studies of interfacial behaviors at the true molecular scale.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Component Dual Donor Enables Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Co&#8208;release of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single&#8208;component ultrasound&#8208;responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.







Abstract
The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report an ultrasound&#8208;responsive water&#8208;soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on single&#8208;component sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co&#8208;release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-substituted 3-hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single-component ultrasound-responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). The co-release of CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.

         <title>Importing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy through Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd Bridge Promotes Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth oxides via an RE metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;mediated strategy to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR.







Abstract
The active&#8208;site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Pd&#8722;based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to their application in industrial energy devices. This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth (RE) oxides (Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and CeO2) by using RE metal&#8211;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8722;RExOy interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd2O3. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 VRHE), half&#8208;wave potential (0.877&#8197;VRHE), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm2O3/C, Pd&#8722;Eu2O3/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO2/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR. The pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd2O3 is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.

         <title>Ambient &#947;&#8208;Rays&#8208;Mediated Noble&#8208;Metal Deposition on Defect&#8208;Rich Manganese Oxide for Glycerol&#8208;Assisted H2 Evolution at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Density</title>

A series of noble metal nanoparticles are constructed by ambient in situ &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation reduction and form strong interfacial coupling with defect&#8208;rich carriers through M&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds, accelerating electron transfer. The activated catalytic sites combined with oxygen vacancies lower the energy barrier and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, resulting in an outstanding performance for GOR and HER.







Abstract
Developing novel synthesis technologies is crucial to expanding bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. Herein, we report an ambient and controllable &#947;&#8208;ray radiation reduction to synthesize a series of noble metal nanoparticles anchored on defect&#8208;rich manganese oxides (M@MnO2&#8208;x, M=Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) for glycerol&#8208;assisted H2 evolution. Benefiting from the strong penetrability of &#947;&#8208;rays, nanoparticles and defect supports are formed simultaneously and bridged by metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, guaranteeing structural stability and active site exposure. The special Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds activate the Ru and Mn sites in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x through strong interfacial coordination, driving glycerol electrolysis at low overpotential. Furthermore, only a low cell voltage of 1.68&#8197;V is required to achieve 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer system along with excellent stability. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals that the strong interfacial coordination in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x balances the competitive adsorption of glycerol and OH* on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the defect&#8208;rich MnO2 support promotes the dissociation of H2O, while the defect&#8208;regulated Ru sites promote deprotonation and hydrogen desorption, synergistically enhancing glycerol&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective method to remove the surface ligand from Pd nanosheets by simply aging the sample in ethanol at room temperature. This slow process allows for atomic reconstruction without altering the sheet morphology. When exposed to e&#8208;beam irradiation or working as an electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation, the aged Pd nanosheets show enhanced stability.







Abstract
Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93&#177;0.17&#8197;nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both e&#8208;beam irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., ethanol oxidation). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.

A novel photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalysed stereoconvergent Stille reaction is designed for the first time, allowing for the construction of a rich range of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity under exceptionally mild conditions. The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm in the realm of Stille reactions.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. Despite notable strides in the advancement of the Stille reaction, persistent challenges persist in hindering its greener evolution. These challenges encompass multiple facets, such as the high cost of precious metals and ligands, the demand for various additives, and the slow reaction rate. In comparison to the dominant palladium&#8208;catalysed Stille reactions, cost&#8208;effective nickel&#8208;catalysed systems lag behind, and enantioconvergent Stille reactions of racemic stannanes remain undeveloped. Herein, we present a pioneering instance of nickel&#8208;catalysed enantioconvergent Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions of racemic stannane reagents, resulting in the formation of C&#8722;C bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under exceptionally mild conditions (without additives and bases, ambient temperature). The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm of Stille reactions.

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structural and valence state evolutions ranging from the initial Mn3.0&#8208;N4 to Mn3.8&#8208;N3C, followed by Mn3.2&#8208;N2C2, and ultimately returning to Mn3.0&#8208;N4 have been detected for Mn SAS during ORR by operando synchrotron radiation. The evolved configurations can regulate O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to promote ORR activity.







Abstract
Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8208;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8208;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8208;N4 into Mn&#8208;N3C and further into Mn&#8208;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8208;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8208;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8208;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99&#8197;V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.

         <title>0D Pyramid&#8208;intercalated 2D Bimetallic Halides with Tunable Electronic Structures and Enhanced Emission under Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a new unique family of hybrid layered bimetallic halides with Cd/Cu as the MII site and Sb as the MIII site within the layered structure, with intercalated SbCl5 pyramids. These materials exhibit tunable electronic properties and optical band gaps from 2 to 3&#8197;eV. Using pressure as an external stimulus, the photoluminescence of the Cd analog is largely enhanced by 11&#8197;times.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are emerging semiconductors as promising candidates for optoelectronics. The pursuit of hybridizing various dimensions of metal halides remains a desirable yet highly complex endeavor. By utilizing dimension engineering, a diverse array of new materials with intrinsically different electronic and optical properties has been developed. Here, we report a new family of 2D&#8208;0D hybrid bimetallic halides, (C6N2H14)2SbCdCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCd) and (C6N2H14)2SbCuCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCu). These compounds adopt a new layered structure, consisting of alternating 0D square pyramidal [SbCl5] and 2D inorganic layers sandwiched by organic layers. SbCd and SbCu have optical band gaps of 3.3 and 2.3&#8197;eV, respectively. These compounds exhibit weak photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature, and the PL gradually enhances with decreasing temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that SbCd and SbCu are direct gap semiconductors, where first&#8208;principles band gaps follow the experimental trend. Moreover, given the different pressure responses of 0D and 2D components, these materials exhibit highly tunable electronic structures during compression, where a remarkable 11&#8197;times enhancement in PL emission is observed for SbCd at 19&#8197;GPa. This work opens new avenues for designing new layered bimetallic halides and further manipulating their structures and optoelectronic properties via pressure.

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated AuIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene bisimide modified by cyclometalated AuIII complex with unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model in crystalline state was synthesized and employed for controlled fabrication of monolayer films via the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. Based on the film, a conceptual luminescent sensor was further developed, which allowed high&#8208;performance sensing of a new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine.







Abstract
Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8722;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt;4&#8197;ppb, &lt;1&#8197;s, and &lt;5&#8197;s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.

         <title>Rational Atom Substitution to Obtain Efficient, Lead&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Perovskites Assisted by Machine Learning and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple machine learning model combined with theoretical calculations was employed to streamline optimisation and accurately identify substituents, highlighting the importance of d10 configuration in modulating Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite electronic structure. This approach seamlessly integrates with experimental validation, affirming d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ enhances Cs2AgBiBr6 photoactivity for toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Inorganic lead&#8208;free halide perovskites, devoid of toxic or rare elements, have garnered considerable attention as photocatalysts for pollution control, CO2 reduction and hydrogen production. In the extensive perovskite design space, factors like substitution or doping level profoundly impact their performance. To address this complexity, a synergistic combination of machine learning models and theoretical calculations were used to efficiently screen substitution elements that enhanced the photoactivity of substituted Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites. Machine learning models determined the importance of d10 orbitals, highlighting how substituent electron configuration affects electronic structure of Cs2AgBiBr6. Conspicuously, d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ boosted the photoactivity of Cs2AgBiBr6. Experimental verification validated these model results, revealing a 13&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic toluene conversion compared to the unsubstituted counterpart. This enhancement resulted from the small charge carrier effective mass, as well as the creation of shallow trap states, shifting the conduction band minimum, introducing electron&#8208;deficient Br, and altering the distance between the B&#8208;site cations d band centre and the halide anions p band centre, a parameter tuneable through d10 configuration substituents. This study exemplifies the application of computational modelling in photocatalyst design and elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. It underscores the potential of synergistic integration of calculations, modelling, and experimental analysis across various applications.

         <title>A Fast Na&#8208;Ion Conduction Polymer Electrolyte via Triangular Synergy Strategy for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast Na&#8208;ion conduction polymer electrolyte was designed through a triangular synergy strategy, which limits the migration of ionic liquid and facilitates the dissociation of salt, resulting in a faster Na+ conduction in the polymer electrolyte. The modified polymer electrolyte led to a salt&#8208;decomposition dominated interphase, which effectively suppressed gas evolution from ionic liquid decomposition, ensuring battery safety.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes provide a visible pathway for the construction of high&#8208;safety quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high interface compatibility and processability. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transfer at room temperature seriously limits their applications. Herein, a triangular synergy strategy is proposed to accelerate Na&#8208;ion conduction via the cooperation of polymer&#8208;salt, ionic liquid, and electron&#8208;rich additive. Especially, PVDF&#8208;HFP and NaTFSI salt acted as the framework to stably accommodate all the ingredients. An ionic liquid (Emim+&#8208;FSI&#8722;) softened the polymer chains through a weakening molecule force and offered additional liquid pathways for ion transport. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electron&#8208;rich Nerolin with &#960;&#8208;cation interaction facilitated the dissociation of NaTFSI and effectively restrained the competitive migration of large cations from EmimFSI, thus lowering the energy barrier for ion transport. The strategy resulted in a thin F&#8208;rich interphase dominated by NaTFSI salt's decomposition, enabling rapid Na+ transmission across the interface. These combined effects resulted in a polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (1.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and tNa+ (0.79) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled cells delivered reliable rate capability and stability (200 cycles, 99.2&#8201;%, 0.5&#8197;C) with a good safety performance.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Macroscopic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry is usually employed for joining components at microscopic level, but is not suitable for connecting macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize flexible manufacturing of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, of significance on parallel manufacturing. Herein, macroscopic click chemistry is achieved using hydrogels as macroscopic building blocks.







Abstract
The click reaction has found good utility across various fields due to the characteristics of high efficiency, atom economy, simple and mild reaction conditions. Click chemistry is usually utilized for connecting components of microscopic level, while it is still unable for joining macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels G1 and G2 were prepared by incorporating M1 (N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) and P1 (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion&#8208;induced amino&#8208;yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain&#8208;like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

         <title>Ultrashort Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Oxyfluorides by Covalency Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals A5Ta3OF18 (A = K, Rb) were designed and synthesized by a newly developed de&#8208;covalency band gap engineering strategy. With the optimized combination of two types of 5d0&#8208;Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra, they simultaneously realized strong SHG efficiencies and record&#8208;short phase&#8208;matching wavelength.







Abstract
The development of urgently&#8208;needed ultraviolet (UV)/deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by contradictory requirements of the microstructure, in particular the need for a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response as well as a short phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength. We herein employ a &#8220;de&#8208;covalency&#8221; band gap engineering strategy to adjust the optical linearity and nonlinearity. This has been achieved by assembling two types of transition&#8208;metal (TM) polyhedra ([TaO2F4] and [TaF7]), affording the first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent NLO materials, A5Ta3OF18 (A = K (KTOF), Rb (RTOF)). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the highly ionic bonds and strong electropositivity of tantalum in the two oxyfluorides induce record short PM wavelengths (238 (KTOF) and 240 (RTOF) nm) for d0&#8208;TM&#8208;centered oxides, in addition to strong SHG responses (2.8 &#215; KH2PO4 (KTOF) and 2.6 &#215; KH2PO4 (RTOF)), and sufficient birefringences (0.092 (KTOF) and 0.085 (RTOF) at 546&#8197;nm). These results not only broaden the available strategies for achieving deep&#8208;UV NLO materials by exploiting the currently neglected d0&#8208;TMs, but also push the shortest PM wavelength into the short&#8208;wavelength UV region.

         <title>Length&#8208;Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from S=0 (closed&#8208;shell bisanthene) to S=0 (open&#8208;shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from S=0 to S=1/2.







Abstract
Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;&#8208;electron state, which can be described as a spin&#8208;polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed&#8208;shell to an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4&#8197;meV and a charge transfer&#8208;induced doublet. Therefore, this study formulated a chemically tunable platform to explore size&#8208;dependent &#960; magnetism at the atomic scale, providing a framework for research in organic spintronics.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) with Brilliant Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with optimized two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) performance were constructed by building block modification and crystal engineering, showing good performance in two&#8208;photon cellular imaging applications.







Abstract
By synergistically employing four key strategies: (I)&#8197;introducing tetraphenylethylene groups as the central core unit with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, (II)&#8197;optimizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated length by extending the building block branches, (III)&#8197;incorporating flexible groups containing ethylenic bonds, and (IV)&#8197;applying crystal engineering to attain dense stacking mode and highly twisty conformation, we successfully synthesized a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibiting exceptional one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. Notably, when utilizing the fluorescently superior building block L2, HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;7 and HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;8 exhibiting high quantum yields (QY) of 82.1&#8201;% and 77.1&#8201;%, and ultrahigh two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections of 148959.5&#8197;GM and 123901.1&#8197;GM were achieved. These materials were successfully employed in one and two&#8208;photon excited lysosome&#8208;targeting cellular imaging. It is believed that this strategy, combining building block optimization and crystal engineering, holds significant potential for guiding the development of outstanding fluorescent HOF materials.

         <title>Amphiphilic Heterografted Molecular Bottlebrushes with Tertiary Amine&#8208;Containing Side Chains as Efficient and Robust pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular bottlebrushes with randomly grafted hydrophobic and pH&#8208;responsive polymer side chains are efficient and robust responsive emulsifiers for generation of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, which exhibit both high stability, derived from large molecular sizes and interfacial Janus structures, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The formation and disruption of emulsions were repeated 10 times, and the bottlebrushes remained intact.







Abstract
By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) and pH&#8208;responsive poly(2&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH&#8208;responsive emulsifiers. Water&#8208;in&#8208;toluene emulsions were formed at pH&#8197;4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH&#8197;10.0, PDEAEMA became water&#8208;insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de&#8208;emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Zwitterionic Hemicyanine Reporters for Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Assessment of Acute Renal Failure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable reporter ZCRR is developed by masking zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanine with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8. Systematic administration of ZCRR enables sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise prediction of renoprotective therapeutic effects through in vitro optical urinalysis.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced renal failure (DIRF) poses a serious medical complication with high mortality risk. However, early diagnosis or prognosis of DIRF remain challenging, as current methods rely on detecting late&#8208;stage biomarkers. Herein we present a library of zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanines (ZCs) available for constructing activatable reporters to detect DIRF since its initial stage. Zwitterionic properties of these probes are achieved through interspersedly integrating alkyl sulfonates and quaternary ammonium cations onto hemicyanine skeleton, which result in record low plasma protein binding (&lt;5&#8201;%) and remarkable renal clearance efficiencies (&#8776;96&#8201;%). An activatable reporter ZCRR is further developed by masking the optimal candidate ZC6 with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8, an initiating indicator of apoptosis. In living mice with cisplatin&#8208;induced DIRF, systematically administered ZCRR efficiently accumulates in kidneys and responds to elevated caspase&#8208;8 for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217;, enabling sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise evaluation of apoptosis remediation effects by different medications on DIRF mice. As it's urinary excretable, ZCRR also allows for remote detection of DIRF and predicting renoprotective efficacy through in vitro optical urinalysis. This study thus presents unimolecular renal clearable scaffolds that are applicable to developing versatile activatable reporters for renal diseases management.

         <title>Al2O3&#8208;coated BiVO4 Photoanodes for Photoelectrocatalytic Regioselective C&#8722;H Activation of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the regioselective activation of aromatic amines C&#8722;H bonds is reported using a BiVO4 photoanode coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 protective layer, overcoming the problems of low reactivity and poor stability in photoelectrocatalytic organic synthesis. The deposition of Al2O3 enables maintaining stable photocurrent and the yield of the target product dramatically increases from 48&#8201;% to 84&#8201;%. Beyond high efficiency and excellent repeatability, this photoelectrocatalytic strategy exhibits good functional group tolerance and environmental friendliness, making it promising for sustainable organic transformations.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry is becoming an innovative approach to organic synthesis. Generally, the current photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations suffer from limited reaction type, low conversion efficiency and poor stability. Herein, we develop efficient and stable photoelectrode materials using metal oxide protective layer, with a focus on achieving regioselective activation of amine compounds. Notably, our photoelectrochemistry process is implemented under mild reaction conditions and does not involve any directing groups, transition metals or oxidants. The results demonstrate that beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis exhibits high efficiency, remarkable repeatability and good functional group tolerance, highlighting its great potential for applications.

&lt;p&gt;A novel approach for the regioselective activation of aromatic amines C&#8722;H bonds is reported using a BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode coated with an ultrathin Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective layer, overcoming the problems of low reactivity and poor stability in photoelectrocatalytic organic synthesis. The deposition of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enables maintaining stable photocurrent and the yield of the target product dramatically increases from 48&#8201;% to 84&#8201;%. Beyond high efficiency and excellent repeatability, this photoelectrocatalytic strategy exhibits good functional group tolerance and environmental friendliness, making it promising for sustainable organic transformations.

A bicyclo[1.1.0]diphosphadisilabutane radical anion salt, namely [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}.&#8722; (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), has been isolated and characterized. This unique species showcases a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. What makes it particularly intriguing is the presence of an extremely rare 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron P&#8722;P &#960; bond, which exists in the absence of a supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.







Abstract
Featuring an extra electron in the &#960;* antibonding orbital, species with a 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (2c3e) &#960; bond without an underlying &#963; bond are scarcely known. Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a radical anion salt [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (i.e. [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+3&#8901;&#8722;) (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in which 3&#8901;&#8722; features a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. This species represents the first example of a Si&#8208; and P&#8208;containing analog of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. The unusual bonding motif of 3&#8901;&#8722; was thoroughly investigated via X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and calculations by density functional theory (DFT), which collectively unveiled the existence of a 2c3e &#960; bond between the bridgehead P atoms and no clearly defined supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodized polyacrylonitrile anodes (I&#8208;PAN) can regulate the bulk/interphase metal&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and metal&#8208;ion desolvation chemistry of the electrolyte, and simultaneously reutilize the dead/plated metal. Benefiting from these features, the unprecedented extremely fast&#8208;charging performance can be achieved for a series of metal (Li, Na)&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN as anodes.







Abstract
The fast&#8208;charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I&#8208;PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li&#8208;ion desolvation process to realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I&#8208;PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self&#8208;induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6&#8722; not only promote the Li&#8208;ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Consequently, the I&#8208;PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (39&#8201;% of capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The I&#8208;PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000&#8197;cycles at extremely high rates of 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=180&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). We also demonstrate high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN anodes.

         <title>Spiroluchuene A Synthase: A Cyclase from Aspergillus luchuensis Forming a Spirotetracyclic Diterpene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diterpene synthase for spiroluchuene A exhibiting a novel skeleton was discovered from Aspergillus luchuensis. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allowed for the isolation of spiroluchuene B and the intermediate spiroluchuene. The enzyme mechanism was deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The thermal reactions of luchudiene were studied.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AlTS was identified from Aspergillus luchuensis. AlTS catalyses the formation of the diterpene hydrocarbon spiroluchuene A, which exhibits a novel skeleton characterised by a spirocyclic ring system. The cyclisation mechanism towards this compound was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The biosynthetic intermediate luchudiene, besides the derivative spiroluchuene B, was captured from an enzyme variant obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. With its 10&#8208;membered ring luchudiene is structurally related to germacrenes and can undergo a Cope rearrangement to luchuelemene.

         <title>Direct Quantification of Nanoplastics Neurotoxicity by Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PS nanoplastics&#8208;induced reductions in exocytotic activity have been quantified by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggested that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of F&#8208;actin assemblies. This research provides key hints for deciphering how nanoplastics affect neurotransmitter secretion and neural functions.







Abstract
Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers the first direct evidence for the nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane&#8208;vesicle fusion pore opening&#8208;closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F&#8208;actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis.

     alt="Direct Quantification of Nanoplastics Neurotoxicity by Single-Vesicle Electrochemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS nanoplastics-induced reductions in exocytotic activity have been quantified by single-vesicle electrochemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggested that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of F-actin assemblies. This research provides key hints for deciphering how nanoplastics affect neurotransmitter secretion and neural functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers the first direct evidence for the nanoplastics-induced neurotoxicity by single-vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single-vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane-vesicle fusion pore opening-closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F-actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis. Our finding shapes the first quantitative picture of neurotoxicity induced by high-concentration nanoplastics exposure at a single-cell level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Surface Atomic Monogeneity of Rh2P Nanocatalysts by Defect&#8208;Derived Phosphorus Vacancies for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;derived surface phosphorus vacancies on ultrathin Rh2P nanowires break the monogeneity and atomic regularity of thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces, which can create additional Rh sites to act as exclusive H adsorption sites and diminish the inhibition effect of the interfacial water network to achieve drastically improved alkaline HOR electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces is promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi&#8208;step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect&#8208;derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P&#8208;vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P&#8208;terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p&#8208;Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d&#8208;Rh2P). The P&#8208;vacancies enable the exposure of sub&#8208;surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites. Therein, the Had cooperates with the OHad on the peripheral P&#8208;sites to effectively accelerate the alkaline HOR. Defective Rh2P nanowires (d&#8208;Rh2P NWs) and perfect Rh2P nanocubes (p&#8208;Rh2P NCs) are then elaborately synthesized to experimentally represent the d&#8208;Rh2P and p&#8208;Rh2P catalytic surfaces. As expected, the P&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched d&#8208;Rh2P NWs catalyst exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and outstanding CO tolerance for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, attaining 5.7 and 14.3&#8197;times mass activity that of p&#8208;Rh2P NCs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. This work sheds light on breaking the surface atomic monogeneity for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ tracking of ion transport kinetics under nanoconfinement was achieved by transient single&#8208;particle imaging method. The results implied that the ion transport kinetics in long nanochannels is dominated by the in&#8208;pore diffusion, while in short nanopores/nanochannels is governed by electrical double layer (EDL) formation. The local ion accumulation within EDL changes the ion mobility and then affects the apparent ion transport kinetics.







Abstract
The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Tetramers for Efficient Xe/Kr Separation</title>

The first example of microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46, based on hydrogen&#8208; bonding tetramers that is self&#8208;assembled from tetrahedral building block tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) phenyl) silane was reported. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 shows highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr mixture with the highest Xe uptake and IAST selectivity among the reported HOFs up to date.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been emerging as a new type of very promising microporous materials for gas separation and purification, but few HOFs structures constructed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers have been explored in this field. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46) afforded by hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers with 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamond networks, which shows excellent chemical and thermal stability. What's more, activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 exhibits the highest xenon (Xe) uptake of 2.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and xenon/krypton (Kr) selectivity of 19.9 at the ambient condition among the reported HOFs up to date. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirmed the excellent Xe/Kr separation of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a, showing high Kr productivity (110&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Xe uptake (1.29&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as good recyclability. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the molecular simulations revealed that the abundant accessible aromatic and pyrazole rings in the pore channels of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a can provide the multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Xe interactions with Xe atoms.

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide clusters based on trivalent lanthanide ions have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Furthermore, the introduction of trivalent antimony (Sb3+) doping results in the emergence of new energy&#8208;level structures for electronic transitions, which enables precise control over the emission color by varying the excitation wavelength.







Abstract
The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8211;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+=[CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+=Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90&#8211;100&#8201;%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.

&lt;p&gt;The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength-dependent (Ex-De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in light-emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8211;inorganic compound, (DMA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;LnCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (DMA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=[CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;=Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex-De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). The pristine (DMA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;LnCl&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90&#8211;100&#8201;%. Upon Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex-De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host-sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex-De emitters based on Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocyclic Encapsulation in a Non&#8208;fused Tetrathiophene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with High Short&#8208;Circuit Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor R4T&#8208;1 was designed via macrocyclic encapsulation on the simple tetrathiophene, which achieves conformational unicity, eliminates intermolecular electronic cross&#8208;communication at the center and guarantees the formation of efficient charge transport channels. Thus, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.10&#8201;% with a significantly enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2 was accomplished.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors have shown great promise for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, challenges in achieving high efficiency molecular system with conformational unicity and effective molecular stacking remain. In this study, we present a new design of non&#8208;fused tetrathiophene acceptor R4T&#8208;1 via employing the encapsulation of tetrathiophene with macrocyclic ring. The single crystal structure analysis reveals that cyclic alkyl side chains can perfectly encapsulate the central part of molecule and generate a conformational stable and planar molecular backbone. Whereas, the control 4T&#8208;5 without the encapsulation restriction displays cis&#8208; and twisted conformation. As a result, R4T&#8208;1 based OSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 15.10&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2, which is significantly improved by &#8776;30&#8201;% in relative to that of the control. Our findings demonstrate that the macrocyclic encapsulation strategy could assist fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors (FNEAs) to achieve a high photovoltaic performance and pave a new way for FNEAs design.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy has been developed to enable visible&#8208;light excited ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP). The multi&#8208;esterification strategy boosts transition dipole moments, leading to the most efficient UL&#8208;RTP in flexible films upon excitation with blue light, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in time&#8208;delayed white LEDs and flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.







Abstract
The development of ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in processable amorphous organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient UL&#8208;RTP from amorphous materials remains a challenging task, especially with activation by visible light and a bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification of a rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes the aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a &#8242;four birds with one stone&#8242; possibility in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light through enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from a significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing the intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light&#8208;stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01&#8197;s and efficiency up to 35.4&#8201;% upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm) in flexible films using multi&#8208;esterified coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and information technology based on flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Propyne/Propylene by a Scalable Nanoporous Crystal with Confined Rotational Shutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft nanoporous crystal has been developed that can separate propyne/propylene mixtures by sieving. This occurs by the rotational movement of pyridyl rings within this framework creating a pore with a maximum size of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, thereby facilitating the adsorption of propyne while completely excluding propylene.







Abstract
Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules as a result of their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4&#8197;&#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4&#8197;&#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby leads to a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 under ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for the feasible removal of C3H4 from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.

Capturing CO2&#160;from flue gas and using renewable or excess electricity to convert CO2&#160;into high value&#8208;added products can help solve environmental and energy problems. A silver clusters&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework simultaneously possessing CO2&#160;capture sites as "CO2&#160;relays" and eCO2RR active sites, which can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2&#160;from simulated flue gas but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2&#160;into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2&#160;conversion, was revealed by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311265).

         <dc:description>
The monochromophoric design of fluorogenic probes opens exciting possibilities for dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal imaging with a single probe. In their Research Article (e202310665), Seung Bum Park et&#8197;al. synthesized a series of fluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes and demonstrated excellent BCN&#8208;selective fluorescence enhancement in various wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. The discovery of the BCN&#8208;selective behavior&#8242;s origin and a unique fluorescence recovery in hydrophobic media enabled dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging using a single probe.

         <dc:description>
Photonic crystals can display vivid structural colors via a selective reflection of visible light, and designing their spectra remains a challenge. In their Communication (e202311451), Koki Sano, Yasuhiro Ishida et&#8197;al. report a reconfigurable photonic crystal consisting of an aqueous dispersion of inorganic nanosheets that reversibly exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors when annealed under homogeneous and gradient temperature conditions, respectively.

The peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) photoswitch pushes the limit of red&#8208; and NIR&#8208;light responsiveness, as reported by Henry Dube et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202312955). It possesses strongly red&#8208;shifted absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, very large photochromism, high thermal stability of the metastable state, and can reversibly be photoisomerized with 780&#8197;nm and 625&#8197;nm (or 590&#8197;nm) light. The picture presents a photograph of a transparent polystyrene polymer with embedded PAT photoswitch. After application of a photomask the structural changes of PAT and wavelengths usable for photoswitching are inscribed with red light.

         <title>Engineering Enzymes for Environmental Sustainability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how engineered enzymes have been developed and implemented to help address environmental challenges. Topics include the use of engineered enzymes for improving carbon capture and utilisation, bioremediation, plastic deconstruction, and renewable feedstock generation. Successes, challenges, and opportunities for future enzyme engineering campaigns to improve environmental sustainability are discussed.







Abstract
The development and implementation of sustainable catalytic technologies is key to delivering our net&#8208;zero targets. Here we review how engineered enzymes, with a focus on those developed using directed evolution, can be deployed to improve the sustainability of numerous processes and help to conserve our environment. Efficient and robust biocatalysts have been engineered to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and have been embedded into new efficient metabolic CO2 fixation pathways. Enzymes have been refined for bioremediation, enhancing their ability to degrade toxic and harmful pollutants. Biocatalytic recycling is gaining momentum, with engineered cutinases and PETases developed for the depolymerization of the abundant plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Finally, biocatalytic approaches for accessing petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks and chemicals are expanding, using optimized enzymes to convert plant biomass into biofuels or other high value products. Through these examples, we hope to illustrate how enzyme engineering and biocatalysis can contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient chemical industry.

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Membranes for Drinking Water Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, etc. This review focuses on the progress and advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production, including preparations, separation mechanisms, and applications.







Abstract
The soaring development of industry exacerbates the shortage of fresh water, making drinking water production an urgent demand. Membrane techniques feature the merits of high efficiency, low energy consumption, and easy operation, deemed as the most potential technology to purify water. Recently, a new type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes as the transition metal carbides or nitrides in the shape of nanosheets, have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, mechanical strength, and light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transformation capability. In pioneering studies, MXene&#8208;based membranes have been evaluated in the past decade for drinking water production including the separation of bacteria, dyes, salts, and heavy metals. This review focuses on the recent advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production. A brief introduction of MXenes is given first, followed by descriptions of their unique properties. Then, the preparation methods of MXene membranes are summarized. The various applications of MXene membranes in water treatment and the corresponding separation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MXene membranes are presented with the hope to provide insightful guidance on the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance MXene membranes.

         <title>Frontier Molecular Orbital Engineering: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, highlighting the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering strategy.







Abstract
It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500&#8197;nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group Metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recently explored porous and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) with few&#8208;atomic thicknesses via various synthetic techniques. It also highlights their unique structural benefits, particularly for manipulating the intrinsic electronic structure in high&#8208;performance electrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction, and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy for ortho&#8208;Aminophenol Synthesis via Dearomative&#8208;Rearomative Coupling Between Aryl Azides and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of aryl azides with purple light in the presence of alcohols enables the direct preparation of challenging ortho&#8208;aminophenols. The process goes via a singlet nitrene&#8208;mediated dearomative&#8208;rearomative cascade that enables introduction of the alcohol in place of the azide and shifts the amino group to its ortho&#8208;position.







Abstract
ortho&#8208;Aminophenols are aromatic derivatives featuring vicinal N&#8208; and O&#8208;based functionalities commonly found in the structures of many high&#8208;value materials. These molecules are generally prepared using multistep strategies that follow the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Despite their high fidelity, such approaches cannot target substrates featuring a &#8220;contra&#8208;SEAr&#8221; arrangement of N&#8208; and O&#8208;groups. Here we report an alternative strategy for the preparation of such ortho&#8208;aminophenols using aryl azides as the precursors. The process utilizes low&#8208;energy photoexcitation to trigger the decomposition of aryl azides into singlet nitrenes that undergo a dearomative&#8208;rearomative sequence. This allows the incorporation of alcoholic nucleophiles into a seven&#8208;membered ring azepine intermediate via temporary disruption of aromaticity, followed by electrophile&#8208;induced re&#8208;aromatization. The net retrosynthetic logic is that the alcohol displaces the azide, which, in turn, moves to its ortho position and furthermore is converted into an amide. The synthetic value and complementarity of this strategy has been demonstrated by the coupling of aryl azides with complex, drug&#8208;like alcohols and phenols as well as amines, thiols and thiophenols, which provides a general platform for the fast and selective heterofunctionalization of aromatics.

&lt;p&gt;Photolysis of aryl azides with purple light in the presence of alcohols enables the direct preparation of challenging &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-aminophenols. The process goes via a singlet nitrene-mediated dearomative-rearomative cascade that enables introduction of the alcohol in place of the azide and shifts the amino group to its &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-position.

         <title>AIEgens Cross&#8208;linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Synchronously Amplify Bimodal Imaging Signals in Situ by Tumor Acidity&#8208;Mediated Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the aggregation&#8208;enhanced r2 relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles and the aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of AIEgens, a non&#8208;conjugated/coupled dual&#8208;mode probe design strategy is developed to synergistically enhance both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance contrast.







Abstract
Activatable dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging probes present a promising tool for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, synchronously enhancing dual&#8208;modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity&#8208;mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity&#8208;responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross&#8208;linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (&#8776;12.4&#8208;fold) and r2 relaxivity (&#8776;2.8&#8208;fold). cDIOs and AATs were effectively activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross&#8208;linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.

         <title>Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable photonic crystal composed of a colloidal nanosheet dispersed in water reversibly exhibits the single structural color and the double structural color when annealed under homogeneous&#8208;temperature and gradient&#8208;temperature conditions, respectively. This finding will expand the design freedom of structural colors, leading to the next&#8208;generation color materials.







Abstract
Unlike absorption&#8208;based colors of dyes and pigments, reflection&#8208;based colors of photonic crystals, so called &#8220;structural colors&#8221;, are responsive to external stimuli, but can remain unfaded for over ten million years, and therefore regarded as a next&#8208;generation coloring mechanism. However, it is a challenge to rationally design the spectra of structural colors, where one structure gives only one reflection peak defined by Bragg's law, unlike those of absorption&#8208;based colors. Here, we report a reconfigurable photonic crystal that exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors. This photonic crystal is composed of a colloidal nanosheet in water, which spontaneously adopts a layered structure with single periodicity (407&#8197;nm). After a temperature&#8208;gradient treatment, the photonic crystal segregates into two regions with shrunken (385&#8197;nm) and expanded (448&#8197;nm) periodicities, and thus exhibits double reflection peaks that are blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted from the original one, respectively. Notably, the transition between the single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak states is reversible.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8722;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization
</title>

         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of C&#8722;O axially chiral diaryl ethers is demonstrated by the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective esterification of dialdehyde containing diaryl ethers. The reaction proceeds via a desymmetrization of isophthalaldehyde derivatives bearing prochiral dual C&#8722;O axis affording atropoisomeric diaryl ethers with broad scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8722;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8722;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde&#8208;containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8722;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8722;O bonds are also presented.

         <title>Organic Excitonic State Management by Surface Metallic Coupling of Inorganic Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to manipulate the electronic energy states of organic phosphors by coupling with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals NaGdF4 is reported. The metallic atoms introduce strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects to organic chromophores. The result demonstrates the ability of charge transfer mechanism to broaden the utility of organic phosphors.







Abstract
The ability to harness charges and spins for control of organic excitonic states is critical in developing high&#8208;performance organic luminophores and optoelectronic devices. Here we report a facile strategy to efficiently manipulate the electronic energy states of various organic phosphors by coupling them with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals. We show that the metallic atoms exposed on the nanocrystal surface can introduce strong coupling effects to 9&#8208;(4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (OCzT) and some organic chromophores with carbazole functional groups when the organics are approaching the nanocrystals. This unconventional organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization enables a nearly 100&#8201;% conversion of the singlet excitation to fast charge transfer luminescence that does not exist in pristine organics, which broadens the utility of organic phosphors in hybrid systems.

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Fixation and Chiral Regulation Endowed by Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality has been achieved by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, reversible [2+2] cycloaddition of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains allows inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and de&#8208;crosslinking to be controlled by light. This approach offers a pattern&#8208;embedded storage and retrieval mechanism for photo&#8208;editing chiral polymers.







Abstract
The construction of chiral superstructures through the self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made a first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, the reversible [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking. Based on this photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy, a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely conjugated enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugates serve as stabilizers to form Pickering emulsions. In the aqueous phase, enzymes can be expressed in vitro and directly used to construct multiple&#8208;step reactions with the biocatalysts prepositioned on the emulsion droplet surface. This approach integrates the strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient solution for chemical synthesis by cascade biotransformations.







Abstract
In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8208;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from nonspecific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, while encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. The resulting cascade reaction system leveraged enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a fivefold enhancement in catalytic performance as compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo: A Scaffold for Efficient All&#8208;Red&#8208;Light and Near&#8208;Infrared Molecular Photoswitching
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile has been developed, i.e. peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT). The PAT photoswitch possesses absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, extremely large negative photochromism, and high thermal stability of the metastable state. Photochromic polymers showing intense color changes from green to blue demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitching with red light is greatly desired to evade photodamage and achieve specific photoresponses. In virtually all reported cases however, only one switching direction uses red light while for the reverse switching, UV or visible light is needed. All&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching brings with it the clear advantage of pushing photoswitching to the limit of the low&#8208;energy spectrum, but no viable system is available currently. Here we report on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption up to 850&#8197;nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140&#8197;nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable Z isomer is high with a corresponding half&#8208;life of days at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Application in red&#8208;light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching. The PAT photoswitch thus offers unique responsiveness to very low energy light together with predictable and large geometrical changes within a rigid molecular scaffold. We expect a plethora of applications for PAT in the near future, e.g. in materials, molecular machines or biological context.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of a Vinyl Thianthrenium Salt and Secondary Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report an unprecedented reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides, which expands on the currently possible reductive Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the first reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides. The reaction uses a vinyl thianthrenium salt, a palladium catalyst, and an alkyl zinc intermediate formed in situ to trap the LnPdII(vinyl) complex formed after oxidative addition before it undergoes undesired homocoupling to form butadiene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Sulfonylation of Yne&#8208;Allylic Esters with Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction was developed for the sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. Salient features of this practical method include readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Impressive progress has been made in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric propargylic substitution (APS) reaction, but its use in remote asymmetric yne&#8208;allylic substitution remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report the first remote enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. The reaction is assumed to occur via a copper&#8208;vinylvinylidene species as the key reactive intermediate. The use of readily available starting materials, the mild reaction conditions, and the excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), show the practicality and attractiveness of this method.

         <title>Increasing Reduction Potentials of Type 1 Copper Center and Catalytic Efficiency of Small Laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor through Secondary Coordination Sphere Mutations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction potential of type&#8197;1 copper (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) in small laccase (SLAC) has been tuned through mutations of residues in the secondary coordination sphere, with the aim to mimic those in high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu fungal laccases. With three such mutations, we have increased E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu from wild&#8208;type SLAC by +189&#8197;mV to 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE, which is the highest reported to date. We have demonstrated additive E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu tuning of the three mutations and improved catalytic efficiency of the mutants relative to wild&#8208;type SLAC.







Abstract
The key to type 1 copper (T1Cu) function lies in the fine tuning of the CuII/I reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) to match those of its redox partners, enabling efficient electron transfer in a wide range of biological systems. While the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) effects have been used to tune E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu in azurin over a wide range, these principles are yet to be generalized to other T1Cu&#8208;containing proteins to tune catalytic properties. To this end, we have examined the effects of Y229F, V290N and S292F mutations around the T1Cu of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor to match the high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of fungal laccases. Using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, together with X&#8208;ray crystallography and redox titrations, we have probed the influence of SCS mutations on the T1Cu and corresponding E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu. While minimal and small E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increases are observed in Y229F&#8208; and S292F&#8208;SLAC, the V290N mutant exhibits a major E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increase. Moreover, the influence of these mutations on E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu is additive, culminating in a triple mutant Y229F/V290N/S292F&#8208;SLAC with the highest E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE reported to date. Further activity assays indicate that all mutants retain oxygen reduction reaction activity, and display improved catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) relative to WT&#8208;SLAC.

         <title>Dual Photo&#8208;Responsive Diphenylacetylene Enables PET In&#8208;Situ Upcycling with Reverse Enhanced UV&#8208;Resistance and Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the oligomer&#8208;scale, this work implements a novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for PET plastic wastes through tailored diphenylacetylene monomer. Uniquely, the dual photo&#8208;responses of diphenylacetylene enable upcycled PET plastics with reverse enhanced UV&#8208;resistance and strength.







Abstract
A novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for plastic waste is proposed by the customized diphenylacetylene monomer with dual photo&#8208;response. That is, diphenylacetylene reactive monomers are in situ inserted into the macromolecular chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics/fibers through one&#8208;pot transesterification of slight&#8208;depolymerization and re&#8208;polymerization. On the one hand, the diphenylacetylene group absorbs short&#8208;wave high&#8208;energy UV rays and then releases long&#8208;wave low&#8208;energy harmless fluorescence. On the other hand, the UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction among diphenylacetylene groups produces extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in a red&#8208;shift (due to decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO separation) in the UV absorption band and locked crosslink points between PET chains. Therefore, with increasing UV exposure time, the upcycled PET plastics exhibit reverse enhanced UV resistance and mechanical strength (superior to original performance), instead of serious UV&#8208;photodegradation and damaged performance. This upcycling strategy at oligomer&#8208;scale not only provides a new idea for traditional plastic recycling, but also solves the common problem of gradual degradation of polymer performance during use.

         <title>Growth of Merocyanine Dye J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets by Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a new amphiphilic merocyanine dye has been investigated in an aqueous solvent mixture. Two supramolecular polymorphs were observed: The first polymorph is an off&#8208;pathway H&#8208;type nanoparticle (Agg1) and the second is a thermodynamic J&#8208;aggregate nanosheet (Agg2). A seeded living supramolecular polymerization was utilized to accelerate the transformation from metastable nanoparticles into two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates are highly desired dye aggregates but so far there has been no general concept how to accomplish the required slip&#8208;stacked packing arrangement for dipolar merocyanine (MC) dyes whose aggregation commonly affords one&#8208;dimensional aggregates composed of antiparallel, co&#8208;facially stacked MCs with H&#8208;type coupling. Herein we describe a strategy for MC J&#8208;aggregates based on our results for an amphiphilic MC dye bearing alkyl and oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. In an aqueous solvent mixture, we observe the formation of two supramolecular polymorphs for this MC dye, a metastable off&#8208;pathway nanoparticle showing H&#8208;type coupling and a thermodynamically favored nanosheet showing J&#8208;type coupling. Detailed studies concerning the self&#8208;assembly mechanism by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and the packing structure by atomic force microscopy and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering show how the packing arrangement of such amphiphilic MC dyes can afford slip&#8208;stacked two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets whose macrodipole is compensated by the formation of a bilayer structure. As an additional feature we demonstrate how the size of the nanosheets can be controlled by seeded living supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Block Copolymers: New Scission Site due to Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected mechanochemistry kinetics and selective off&#8208;center scission behavior is shown in linear block copolymers (BCPs) stressed in solution. Molecular dynamics modeling suggests a dynamic phase separation of the blocks inducing the unusual distribution of applied forces, and promoting force focusing at the interface.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry can lead to the degradation of the properties of covalent macromolecules. In recent years, numerous functional materials have been developed based on block copolymers (BCPs), however, like homopolymers, their chains could undergo mechanochemical damage during processing, which could have crucial impact on their performance. To investigate the mechanochemical response of BCPs, multiple polymers comprising different ratios of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with similar degree of polymerization and stressed in solution via ultrasonication. Interestingly, all BCPs, regardless of the amount of the methacrylate monomer, presented a mechanochemistry rate constant similar to that of the methacrylate homopolymer, while a random copolymer reacted like the acrylate homopolymer. Size&#8208;exclusion chromatography showed that, in addition to the typical main peak shift towards higher retention times, a different daughter fragment was produced indicating a secondary selective scission site, situated around the covalent connection between the two blocks. Molecular dynamics modeling using acrylate and methacrylate oligomers were carried out and indicated that dynamic phase separation occurs even in a good solvent. Such non&#8208;random conformations can explain the faster polymer mechanochemistry. Moreover, the dynamic model for end&#8208;to&#8208;end chain overstretching supports bond scission which is not necessarily chain&#8208;centered.

         <dc:description>
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. These fluorophores show high fluorescence quantum yields, together with large Stokes shifts and high photostability, qualifying them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.







Abstract
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, PAI, is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. Owing to the rigid structure, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and pronounced push&#8208;pull substitution, these fluorophores show emission maxima up to 804&#8197;nm and large Stokes shifts. The extraordinarily high fluorescence quantum yields from 47&#8201;% to 70&#8201;% are attributed to chloro substitution in the bay positions of the perylene core. These characteristics, together with high photostability, qualify them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinment of a spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene guest (BCNMC) in a cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) host has led to a light&#8208;driven multicolor luminescent supramolecular shuttle, which exhibits reversible conversion of the topological morphology. Alternating irradiation with visible light and the absence of light results in different fluorescence colors for information encryption.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on the doping of dyes or a photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange by simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by the macrocyclic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8211;guest complex displayed enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in the dark within 2&#8197;hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30&#8197;s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of the spiropyran moiety to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction is a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle as a result of intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8211;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the spiropyran supramolecular shuttle confined in the macrocyclic host CB[8] not only modulated a reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption.

         <title>Accelerated Electrophotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Heteroarylation Enabled by an Efficient Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable flow reactor for electrophotocatalysis is presented. The reactor can simultaneously exploit photons and electrons. The efficacy of this reactor was demonstrated in a novel electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalytic transformations are garnering attention in organic synthesis, particularly for accessing reactive intermediates under mild conditions. Moving these methodologies to continuous&#8208;flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (f&#8208;EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost&#8208;effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Michelle Arkin and Adam Renslo from the University of California, San Francisco in the USA and Luc Brunsveld and Christian Ottmann from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. They recently published an article on designing molecular glues for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/estrogen receptor (ER) protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI). Molecular glues increase the binding between two proteins by binding at the PPI interface. While they hold exciting promise to induce new biology and treat disease, systematic approaches to discover glues are just becoming available. Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery has been used to discover inhibitors of PPI; here, the team demonstrated a fragment discovery and linking strategy to create a new molecular glue for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER, an anticancer target. &#8220;From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions though Fragment Linking&#8221;, E.&#8197;J.

         <title>Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanozyme with neighboring single&#8208;iron sites (Fe2&#8208;SAzyme) was introduced as a bioinspired catalase mimic, featuring excellent activity under varied conditions, twice as high as that of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. Surprisingly, the interatomic spacing tuning between adjacent iron sites also suppressed the competitive peroxidase pathway, remarkably increasing the catalase/peroxidase selectivity up to ~6 times than Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. Theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that the pairwise single&#8208;iron sites may serve as a robust molecular tweezer to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption. The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M = Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to 1000 grams scale, but with no obvious scale&#8208;up effect for both structures and performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Delving into the Variability of Supramolecular Affinity: Self&#8208;Ion Pairing as a Central Player in Aqueous Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of binding constants is a key matter in evaluating the strength of host&#8208;guest interactions. However, the profound impact of self&#8208;ion pairing on this parameter is often underrated in aqueous solution, leading in some cases to a misinterpretation of the true potential of supramolecular assemblies. In the present study, we aim to shed further light on this critical factor by exploring the concentration&#8208;dependent behavior of a multicharged pillararene in aqueous solution. Our findings reveal an extraordinary 1&#8208;million&#8208;fold variability in the affinity of this macrocycle toward a given anion, showcasing the highly dynamic character of electrostatic interactions. We argue that these findings bring to the forefront the inherent determinism that underlies the estimation of affinity constants, a factor profoundly shaped by both the sensitivity of the instrumental technique in use and the intricacies of the experimental design itself. In terms of applications, these results may provide the opportunity to optimize the operational concentrations of multicharged hosts in different scenarios, aiming to achieve their maximum efficiency based on the intended application. Unlocking the potential of this hidden variability may pave the way for the creation of novel molecular materials with advanced functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Eight&#8208;Membered N&#8208;Heterocycles from Simple 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Pd(0) Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein an unprecedented enantioselective (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes for the construction of fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. In this transformation, the &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic Pd(0) catalyst achieves activation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to induce nucleophilic addition to azadienes followed by ring cyclization via a selective terminal allylic substitution. Furthermore, highly efficient and diastereoselective derivatizations of the eight&#8208;membered rings provide a facile access to diverse enantiopure fused tetra&#8208; to hexacyclic compounds with potential application in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig&#8208;type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig&#8208;type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E&#8208;selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti&#8208;elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8208;N&#8208;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in the CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by La&#8208;N&#8208;Cu bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8208;N&#8208;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6 %) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8 &#181;mol g&#8208;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Methylation Yields Acceptor with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#160;Network for High&#8208;Efficiency and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions stands for an effective approach in advancing the efficiency and stability of small&#8208;molecule&#160; acceptors (SMAs) for polymer solar cells. Herein, we synthesized three SMAs (Qo1, Qo2, and Qo3) using indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoxalin&#8208;11&#8208;one (Qox) as the electron&#8208;deficient group, with the incorporation of a methylation strategy. Through crystallographic analysis, it is observed that two Qox&#8208;based methylated acceptors (Qo2 and Qo3) exhibit multiple hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted 3D network transport structures, in contrast to the 2D transport structure observed in gem&#8208;dichlorinated counterpart (Qo4). Notably, Qo2 exhibits multiple and stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions compared with Qo3. Consequently, PM6:Qo2 device realizes the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8%), Qo3 (16.7%), and Qo4 (2.4%). This remarkable PCE in PM6:Qo2 device can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility, more favorable medium structure, and more efficient charge transfer and collection behavior. Moreover, the PM6:Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#176;C for 250 hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SM&#8208;acceptors.</dc:description>

Moreover, the PM6:Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#176;C for 250 hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SM-acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Solvents Regulated Crystallization&#8208;Limited Electrolytes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes that can keep liquid state are one of the most important physical metrics to ensure the ions transfer with stable operation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries at a wide temperature window. It is generally accepted that strong polar solvents with high melting points favor the safe operation of batteries above room temperatures but are susceptible to crystallization at low temperatures (&#8804; &#8208;40&#176;C). Here, a crystallization limitation strategy was proposed to handle this issue. We demonstrate that, although the high melting points of ethylene sulfite (ES, &#8208;17 &#176;C) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, ~23 &#176;C), their mixtures can avoid crystallization at low temperatures, which can be attributed to low intermolecular interactions and altered molecular motion dynamics. A suitable ES/FEC ratio (10% FEC) can balance the bulk and interface transport of ions, enabling LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||lithium (NCM811||Li) full cells to deliver excellent temperature resilience and cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 &#176;C to +70&#8201;&#176;C. More than 66% of the capacity retention rate was achieved at &#8208;50 &#176;C compared to room temperature. The NCM811||Li pouch cells exhibit high cycling stability under realistic conditions (electrolyte weight to cathode capacity ratio (E/C)&#8804;3.5 g Ah&#8208;1, negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P)&#8804;1.09) at different temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Reactivity of Thorium Supported by Redox&#8208;Active Tripodal Frameworks &#8220;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high stability of the +4 oxidation state limits thorium redox reactivity.&#160;Here we report the synthesis and the redox reactivity of two Th(IV) complexes supported by the arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands [(KOSiR2Ar)3&#8208;arene)]. The two electron reduction of these Th(IV) complexes generates the doubly reduced&#160;[KTh((OSi(OtBu)2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2] (2OtBu) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Th(OSiPh2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2](2Ph&#8208;crypt) where the formal oxidation state of Th is +II. Structural&#160;and computational studies indicate that the reduction occurred at the arene anchor of the ligand. The robust tripodal frameworks store in the arene anchor two electrons that become available at the metal center for the two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while retaining the ligand framework. This work shows that arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands allow to implement two&#8208;electron redox chemistry at the thorium center while retaining the ligand framework unchanged.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Amplification and Near&#8208;Infrared Translation of Enzymatic Reactions by Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic reactions are used to detect analytes in a range of biochemical methods. To measure the presence of an analyte, they are conjugated to a recognition unit and convert a substrate into a (colored) product that is detectable by visible (VIS) light. Thus, the lowest enzymatic turnover that can be detected sets a limit on sensitivity. Here, we report that substrates and products of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase change the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence of (bio)polymer modified single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). They translate a VIS signal into a beneficial NIR signal. Moreover, the affinity of the nanosensors leads to a higher effective local concentration of the reactants. This causes a non&#8208;linear sensor&#8208;based signal amplification and translation (SENSAT). We find signal enhancement up to &#8776; 120x for the HRP substrate p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPD), which means that reactions below the limit of detection in the VIS can be followed in the NIR (&#8776;&#160;1000 nm). The approach is also applicable to other substrates such as 3,3&#8217;&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An adsorption&#8208;based theoretical model fits the observed signals and corroborates the sensor&#8208;based enhancement mechanism. This approach can be used to amplify signals, translate them into the NIR and increase sensitivity of biochemical assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Analysis of Complex Reaction Mixtures: Formose Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the&#160;formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non&#8208;negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion&#8208;signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised ~ 300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar&#8208;calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these&#160;complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro&#8208;aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar&#8208;backbone branching for C6 sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C5 sugars. This top&#8208;down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.</dc:description>
