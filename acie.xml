         <title>Bifunctional Ligand Enables Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Propargyl C&#8208;H Functionalization via Reactive Gold Allenylidene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold allenylidene species have been seldom exploited as reactive intermediates in synthetically versatile catalytic reactions. By employing alkynylbenziodoxoles as the substrates and bifunctional WangPhos as the metal ligand, this work demonstrated ready catalytic access to these intermediates of general substitution patterns and their electrophilic reactivities at the &#947;&#8208;carbon center with a diverse range of nucleophiles. The reaction is driven by the reductive decomposition of the benziodoxole moiety and achieves the replacement of a propargylic proton with a N/O/C&#8208;based nucleophile, hence realizing reactivity umpolung. Corroborated by DFT calculations, the reaction mechanism involves a mild propargylic deprotonation. In contrast to prior works employing a tertiary amine functionality, A barely Br&#216;nsted&#8208;basic amide group in WangPhos is surprisingly effective in deprotonation at the propargylic position under a gold&#8208;ligand cooperation regime.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich RuO2 Porous Nanosheet for Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RuO2 has been considered as the most likely acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to replace IrO2, but its performance, especially long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic conditions, is still unacceptable. Here, we propose a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy by fabricating the ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) as an efficient acid OER catalyst. The involvement of GB induces significant tensile stress and creates an unsaturated coordination environment, effectively optimizing the adsorption of intermediates and stabilizing active site structure during OER process. Notably, the GB&#8208;RuO2 not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;10= 187 mV) with an ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34.5 mV dec&#8208;1), but also steadily operates for over 550 h in 0.1 M HClO4. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB&#8208;RuO2 catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669 V at 2 A cm&#8208;2 and operates stably for 100 h at 100 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Defect Engineering in FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 Hybrid for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis: A Pathway to High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational modulation of surface reconstruction in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers is a topical interest in the field of catalysis. The introduction of point defects has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to regulate the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts, but the influence of more complex planar defects (e.g., twins and stacking faults), on their intrinsic activity is still not fully understood. This study harnesses ultrasonic cavitation for rapid and controlled introduction of different types of defects in FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 hybrid coatings, optimizing OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the different defects optimize the coordination environment and facilitate the activation of surface reconstruction into true catalytic activity centers at lower potentials. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional durability, maintaining stable oxygen production at a high current density of 300 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 120 hours. This work not only presents a novel pathway for designing advanced electrocatalysts but also deepens our understanding of defect&#8208;engineered catalytic mechanisms, showcasing the potential for rapid and efficient enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery for hydrogen storage and production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive metals hydrolysis offers significant advantages for hydrogen storage and production. However, the regeneration of common reactive metals (e.g., Mg, Al, etc.) is energy&#8208;intensive and produces unwanted byproducts such as CO2 and Cl2. Herein, we employ Zn as a reactive mediator that can be easily regenerated by electrolysis of ZnO in an alkaline solution with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt; 99.9%. H2 is produced in the same electrolyte by constructing a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery consisting of a Zn anode and a Raney&#8208;Ni cathode to unlock the Zn&#8208;H2O reaction. The entire two&#8208;step water splitting reaction with a net energy efficiency of 70.4% at 80 oC and 50 mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using renewable energy to produce H2 on demand and runs for 600 cycles only sacrificing 3.76% energy efficiency. DFT calculations reveal that the desorption of H* on Raney&#8208;Ni (&#8208;0.30 eV) is closer to zero compared with that on Zn (&#8208;0.87 eV), indicating a faster desorption of H* at low overpotential. Further, a 24 Ah electrolyzer is demonstrated to produce H2 with a net energy efficiency of 65.5%, which holds promise for its real application.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Lithium Salt Molecule Tuning for Fast Charging/Discharging Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By attaching an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group near N atom, the distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI, which enhances ionic separation degree and achieves a more balanced donor number and tuned self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of lithium metal batteries with this self&#8208;folded lithium salt is progressively improved.







Abstract
The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li+ transference number (T+) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self&#8208;folded lithium salt, lithium 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N&#8208;[2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self&#8208;folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8722;N bond (2.069&#8197;&#197;) is revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase &#8220;self&#8208;cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra&#8208;thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.

         <title>Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Olefins using a Heterogeneous Pt&#8208;Ni Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt&#8722;Ni alloy nanocatalyst is developed for the diastereoselective directed hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold. For this substrate class, established homogeneous catalysts generate hydrogenolysis side products, and commercial heterogeneous catalysts are not stereoselective. Uniform alloying of the noble metal and base metal combined with high catalyst dispersion is critical to enabling good reactivity and diastereoselectivity for a range of sterically&#8208;hindered olefins.







Abstract
Stereoselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins is an attractive method to access compounds with two contiguous stereocenters. However, homogeneous catalysts for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation exhibit low reactivity toward tetrasubstituted olefins due to steric crowding between the ligand scaffold and the substrate. Monometallic heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, provide accessible surface active sites for hindered olefins but exhibit unpredictable and inconsistent stereoinduction. In this work, we develop a Pt&#8722;Ni bimetallic alloy catalyst that can diastereoselectively hydrogenate unactivated, sterically&#8208;bulky tetrasubstituted olefins, utilizing the more oxophilic Ni atoms to adsorb a hydroxyl directing group and direct facially&#8208;selective hydrogen addition to the olefin via the Pt atoms. Structure&#8208;activity studies on several Pt&#8722;Ni compositions underscore the importance of exposing a uniform PtNi alloy surface to achieve high diastereoselectivity and minimize side reactions. The optimized Pt&#8722;Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits good functional group tolerance and broad scope for tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold, generating cyclopentanol products with three contiguous stereocenters. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated in a four&#8208;step synthesis of (1R,2S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;cis&#8208;methyldihydrojasmonate with high yield and enantiopurity.

         <title>Anion&#8208;modulated Ion Conductor with Chain Conformational Transformation for stabilizing Interfacial Phase of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional polymer electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries was constructed by modulating the behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) from linear to low entropy globular conformation driven by a multi&#8208;ion environment and achieving the maximum compatibility of the polymer solid electrolyte in situ&#8208;derived poly(carbonate) anionic coating with the electrodes. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating the polymer chain segment conformation for the in situ construction of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
In solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), the inhomogeneous electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase layer aggravates the interfacial stability, leading to discontinuous interfacial ion/charge transport and continuous degradation of the electrolyte. Herein, we constructed an anion&#8208;modulated ionic conductor (AMIC) that enables in situ construction of electrolyte/electrode interphases for high&#8208;voltage SSLMBs by exploiting conformational transitions under multiple interactions between polymer and lithium salt anions. Anions modulate the decomposition behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) (PVC) at the electrode interface by changing the spatial conformation of the polymer chains, which further enhances ion transport and stabilizes the interfacial morphology. In addition, the AMIC weakens the &#8220;Li+&#8208;solvation&#8221; and increases Li+ vehicle sites, thereby enhancing the lithium&#8208;ion transport number (tLi+=~0.67). Consequently, Li&#8201;||&#8201;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell maintains about 85&#8201;% capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.8&#8201;% in 200 cycles at a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. This study provides a new understanding of lithium salt anions regulating polymer chain segment behavior in the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) and highlights the importance of the ion environment in the construction of interfacial phases and ionic conduction.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of DAT2, an Antigenic Glycolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of four stereoisomers of DAT2, an important antigen of M. tuberculosis, showed that the commonly accepted structure of DAT2 and its acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid had to be corrected. DAT2 is an effective ligand activating Mincle, an important pattern recognition receptor of the immune system.







Abstract
DAT2 is a member of the diacyl trehalose family (DAT) of antigenic glycolipids located in the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recently it was shown that the molecular structure of DAT2 had been incorrectly assigned, but the correct structure remained elusive. Herein, the correct molecular structure of DAT2 and its methyl&#8208;branched acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid is determined. For this, four different stereoisomers of mycolipanolic acid were prepared in a stereoselective and unified manner, and incorporated into DAT2. A rigorous comparison of the four isomers to the DAT isolated from Mtb H37Rv by NMR, HPLC, GC, and mass spectrometry allowed a structural revision of mycolipanolic acid and DAT2. Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four stereoisomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>The Transfer Dehydrogenation Method Enables a Family of High Crystalline Benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a transfer dehydrogenation method to prepare a novel series of imidazole&#8208;linked phthalocyanine Cu (II)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) films and powders. The high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs films that possess intrinsic conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m) were fabricated into synaptic devices, which have small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) and response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared.







Abstract
Heterocycle&#8208;linked phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with close&#8208;packed &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structures are a kind of material with intrinsic electrical conductivity, and they are considered to be candidates for photoelectrical devices. Previous studies have revealed their applications for energy storage, gas sensors, and field&#8208;effect transistors. However, their potential application in photodetector is still not fully studied. The main difficulty is preparing high&#8208;quality films. In our study, we found that our newly designed benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) film can hardly formed with a regular aerobic oxidation method. Therefore, we developed a transfer dehydrogenation method with N&#8208;benzylideneaniline (BA) as a mild reagent. With this in hand, we successfully prepared a family of high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs powders and films. Furthermore, both of these new BICuPc&#8208;COFs films showed high electrical conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m), higher than most of the reported COFs materials. Due to the broad absorption and high conductivity of BICuPc&#8208;COFs, synaptic devices with small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) were fabricated with response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared. Based on these findings, we expect this study will provide a new perspective for the application of conducting heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs in synaptic devices.

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural product chlorotonil was modified by late&#8208;stage functionalization and novel reactions. After modifying new positions, activity and selectivity were shown against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Lacking chlorine groups critical for toxicity, the new substance, dehalogenil, was tested in vivo showing strongly improved pharmacokinetics and efficacy in different mouse models of S. aureus infection.







Abstract
The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability, but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S. aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.

         <title>Unveiling Phenoxazine's Unique Reversible Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process and Stable Redox Intermediates for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

This work unveils the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolytes, a noteworthy departure from its less reversible second oxidation process in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Laying the foundation of phenoxazine for realizing multi&#8208;electron storage capacities in high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.







Abstract
The low specific capacity determined by the limited electron transfer of p&#8208;type cathode materials is the main obstruction to their application towards high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). To overcome this challenge, boosting multi&#8208;electron transfer is essential for improving the charge storage capacity. Here, as a typical heteroaromatic p&#8208;type material, we unveil the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox properties of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolytes for the first time. The second oxidation process is stabilized in the aqueous electrolytes, a notable contrast to its less reversibility in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. A comprehensive investigation of the redox chemistry mechanism demonstrates remarkably stable redox intermediates, including a stable cation radical PNO&#8901;+ characterized by effective electron delocalization and a closed&#8208;shell state dication PNO2+. Meanwhile, the heightened aromaticity contributes to superior structural stability during the redox process, distinguishing it from phenazine, which features a non&#8208;equivalent hybridized sp2&#8208;N motif. Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the PNO electrodes deliver a high capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to other p&#8208;type materials, and impressive long cycling stability with 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 3500&#8197;cycles. This work marks a crucial step forward in advanced organic electrodes based on multi&#8208;electron transfer phenoxazine moieties for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Enhancing Chiroptical Responses in Helical Nanographenes via Geometric Engineering of Double [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended helical nanographenes (ED7Hs) have been synthesized where the two embedded [7]helicene units are fused at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively. The obtained ED7Hs display exceptional fivefold amplification in chiroptical responses with enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes with high quantum yields and strong chiroptical responses are pivotal for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Here, we present the successful synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;extended double [7]helicenes (ED7Hs) where two helicene units are fused at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively, as the structural isomers of the reported ortho&#8208;fused ED7H. The structural geometry of these ED7Hs is clearly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Notably, this class of ED7Hs exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yields exceeding 40&#8201;%. Through geometric regulation of two embedded [7]helicene units from ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; to para&#8208;position, these ED7Hs display exceptional amplification in chiroptical responses. This enhancement is evident in a remarkable approximate fivefold increase in the absorbance and luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs and glum), respectively, along with a boosted CPL brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, surpassing the performance of most helicene&#8208;based chiral NGs. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate that the geometric adjustment of two [7]helicene units allows the precise alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, leading to the observed enhancement of their chiroptical responses. This study offers an effective strategy for magnifying the CPL performance in chiral NGs, promoting their expanded application as CPL emitters.

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Artificial Chloride&#8208;Selective Channel Constructed from 5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based compounds that can self&#8208;assemble in a lipid bilayer and show ion transport aided by halogen bonding in addition to hydrogen bonding have been reported. Ion transport studies show that the hexyl&#8208;substituted derivative exhibits the highest level of activity compared to the other derivatives.







Abstract
Despite considerable emphasis on advancing artificial ion channels, progress is constrained by the limited availability of small molecules with the necessary attributes of self&#8208;assembly and ion selectivity. In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5&#8208;haloisophthalamide and a non&#8208;halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted 5&#8208;iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport&#8208;mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self&#8208;assembly of molecules, forming a zig&#8208;zag channel pore that is well&#8208;suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels. A molecular dynamics simulation study, relying on the self&#8208;assembled component derived from the crystal structure, affirmed the paramount significance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the formation of supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette structures that span the bilayer. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transport of chloride across the lipid bilayer membrane is facilitated by the synergistic effects of halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding within the channel.

&lt;p&gt;5-Iodoisophthalamide-based compounds that can self-assemble in a lipid bilayer and show ion transport aided by halogen bonding in addition to hydrogen bonding have been reported. Ion transport studies show that the hexyl-substituted derivative exhibits the highest level of activity compared to the other derivatives.

         <title>Overcoming a Radical Polarity Mismatch in Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]Bicyclobutanes: An Entryway to Sulfone&#8208; and Carbonyl&#8208;Containing SF5&#8208;Cyclobutanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for strain&#8208;release chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes were developed to access unique SF5&#8208;cyclobutane hybrid isosteres via a polarity mismatch radical addition. Structural and mechanistic insight, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for tetrafluoro(aryl)pentafluorosulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)pentafluorosulfanylation, and three&#8208;component reactions, are also provided.







Abstract
The first assortment of achiral pentafluorosulfanylated cyclobutanes (SF5&#8208;CBs) are now synthetically accessible through strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using SF5Cl. Methods for both chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of sulfone&#8208;based BCBs are detailed herein, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the logic extends to tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanylation, and three&#8208;component pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. The methods presented enable isolation of both syn and anti isomers of SF5&#8208;CBs, but we also demonstrate that this innate selectivity can be overridden in chloropentafluorosulfanylation; that is, an anti&#8208;stereoselective variant of SF5Cl addition across sulfone&#8208;based BCBs can be achieved by using inexpensive copper salt additives. Considering the SF5 group and CBs have been employed individually as nonclassical bioisosteres, structural aspects of these unique SF5&#8208;CB &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; were then contextualized using SC&#8208;XRD. From a mechanistic standpoint, chloropentafluorosulfanylation ostensibly proceeds through a curious polarity mismatch addition of electrophilic SF5 radicals to the electrophilic sites of the BCBs. Upon examining carbonyl&#8208;containing BCBs, we also observed rare instances whereby radical addition to the 1&#8208;position of a BCB occurs. The nature of the key C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 bond formation step &#8211; among other mechanistic features of the methods we disclose &#8211; was investigated experimentally and with DFT calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate compatibility of SF5&#8208;CBs with various downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Universal Design and Efficient Synthesis for High Ambipolar Mobility Emissive Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a universal design principle and synthetic shortcut towards HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers (HAME&#8208;CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade&#8208;off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence, the development of HAME&#8208;CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and can be used in multifunctional optoelectronic devices. This work opens a new avenue for developing HAME&#8208;CPs by efficient synthesis and rational design.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Probe for High Spatial Quantitative Imaging of Tumor Nitric Oxide in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that spatial quantification of in vivo NO dynamics is possible using a photoacoustic probe with absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared window as the imaging agent. We have clarified the &#8220;double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword&#8221; function of NO plays in pathophysiology by pinpointing an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm3 for NO, and unveiled the possibility of NO&#8208;mediated communication between the tumor and the liver.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor effects. Therefore, real&#8208;time in vivo imaging and quantification of tumor NO dynamics are essential for understanding the conflicting roles of NO played in pathophysiology. The current molecular probes, however, cannot provide high&#8208;resolution imaging in deep tissues, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Herein, we designed a photoacoustic probe with an absorption maximum beyond 1000&#8197;nm for high spatial quantitative imaging of in vivo tumor NO dynamics. The probe exhibits remarkable sensitivity, selective ratiometric response behavior, and good tumor&#8208;targeting abilities, facilitating ratiometric imaging of tumor NO throughout tumor progression in a micron&#8208;resolution level. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully quantified NO dynamics in tumor, liver and kidney. We have pinpointed an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm3 for NO, which plays a crucial role in the &#8220;double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword&#8221; function of NO in tumors. Furthermore, we revealed a reciprocal relationship between the NO concentration in tumors and that in the liver, providing initial insights into the possible NO&#8208;mediated communication between tumor and the liver. We believe that the probe will help resolve conflicting aspects of NO biology and guide the design of imaging agents for tumor diagnosis and anti&#8208;cancer drug screening.

A facile post&#8208;treatment method is developed to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by dynamically spin&#8208;coating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;high efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs was obtained (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%). Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%.







Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have gained significant attention due to their excellent thermal stability and suitable band gap (~1.7&#8197;eV) for tandem solar cell applications. However, the defect&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, low charge extraction efficiency, energy level mismatches, and so on render the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency inverted IPSCs remains challenging. Here, the use of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol was dynamically spin&#8208;coated on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film, which facilitates the limited etching of defect&#8208;rich subsurface layer, resulting in the formation of vertical PbI2 nanosheet structures. This enabled localized contacts between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer, suppress the recombination of electron&#8208;hole and beneficial to electron extraction. Additionally, the C=O and C=N groups in ABF effectively passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ at grain boundaries and on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. Eventually, we achieved a champion efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%) for inverted IPSCs with enhanced stability, which is the highest value ever reported to date. Furthermore, we successfully prepared p&#8208;i&#8208;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (IPSTSCs) with an efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%. This strategy provided both fast extraction and efficient passivation at the electron&#8208;selective interface.

         <title>An Ultralow&#8208;concentration and Moisture&#8208;resistant Electrolyte of Lithium Difluoro(oxalato)borate in Carbonate Solvents for Stable Cycling in Practical Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an ultra&#8208;low concentration, moisture&#8208;resistant, and environmentally friendly electrolyte of 0.16&#8197;M LiDFOB/EC&#8208;DMC, which is fully compatible with commercial battery materials, leading to long cycling performance.







Abstract
The electrolyte concentration not only impacts the battery performance but also affects the battery cost and manufacturing. Currently, most studies focus on high&#8208;concentration (&gt;3&#8197;M) or localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (~1&#8197;M); however, the expensive lithium salt imposes a major concern. Most recently, ultralow concentration electrolytes (&lt;0.3&#8197;M) have emerged as intriguing alternatives for battery applications, which feature low cost, low viscosity, and extreme&#8208;temperature operation. However, at such an early development stage, many works are urgently needed to further understand the electrolyte properties. Herein, we introduce an ultralow concentration electrolyte of 2&#8197;wt&#8201;% (0.16&#8197;M) lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) in standard carbonate solvents. This electrolyte exhibits a record&#8208;low salt/solvent mass ratio reported to date, thus pointing to a superior low cost. Furthermore, this electrolyte is highly compatible with commercial Li&#8208;ion materials, forming stable and inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode and graphite anode. Consequently, the LiCoO2&#8208;graphite full cell demonstrates excellent cycling performance. Besides, this electrolyte is moisture&#8208;resistant and effectively suppresses the generation of hydrogen fluoride, which will markedly facilitate the battery assembly and recycling process under ambient conditions.

         <title>Highly Selective Acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction Over Cd&#8208;Decorated Cu Catalyst with Efficiently Inhibited Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>

Cd&#8208;decoration breaks the inherent property of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling over Cu&#8208;based catalysts for acetylene electroreduction reaction, achieving a significantly inhibited C4H6 Faradaic efficiency of 0.06&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene feed gas and an ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% in a simulated crude ethylene feedstock.







Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) employing Cu catalysts represents an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective method for ethylene production and purification. However, Cu&#8208;based catalysts encounter product selectivity issues stemming from carbon&#8208;carbon coupling and other side reactions. We explored the use of secondary metals to modify Cu&#8208;based catalysts and identified Cd decoration as particular effective. Cd decoration demonstrated a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.38&#8201;% with well&#8208;inhibited carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions (0.06&#8201;% for butadiene FE at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene gas feed. Notably, ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% was achieved in the crude ethylene feed during prolonged stability tests. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cd metal accelerates the water dissociation on neighboring Cu surfaces allowing more H* to participate in the acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, while increasing the energy barrier for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling, thereby contributing to a high ethylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation efficiency and significant inhibition of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. This study provides a paradigm for a deeper understanding of secondary metals in regulating the product selectivity of EAR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond&#8208;Forming for the Synthesis of Skipped Dienes with Synergistic Aminocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic catalytic strategy has addressed the great challenge in Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond coupling. A variety of structurally diverse skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes are furnished in synthetically useful yields and good enantioselectivity. This strategy has also been applied for the total synthesis of the analogues of (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D.







Abstract
Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions represent a great challenge in homogeneous catalysis primarily due to a limited understanding of its mechanistic principles. Herein, we have developed an interesting catalytic strategy that leverages a synergistic combination of a dimeric manganese(I) catalyst and a chiral aminocatalyst to address this issue. A range of conjugated dienals and trienals can exclusively proceed 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation by using readily available aromatic and aliphatic alkenyl boronic acids as coupling partners, producing a rich library of skipped diene aldehydes in synthetically useful yields and high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, downstream transformations of these products can not only afford a concise approach to construct enantioenriched skipped trienes but also realize enantioselective total synthesis of analogues to (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D in four steps. DFT calculations suggest the 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation is kinetically more favorable than 1,6&#8208;hydroalkenylation.

These reactions feature mild reaction conditions, no need to use excess alcohol, and a unique mechanism that does not feature rate&#8208;determining reductive elimination.







Abstract
We disclose the development of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling method utilizing a new N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand, L8. Under optimized reaction conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an L8&#8208;based catalyst. Notably, the L8&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the L4&#8208;based system previously disclosed for C&#8722;N coupling, namely the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that C&#8722;O coupling utilizing L8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu involves rate&#8208;limiting alkoxide transmetallation, resulting in a mechanism of C&#8722;O bond formation that is distinct from previously described Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, or Ni&#8208;based systems. This lower energy pathway leads to rapid C&#8722;O bond formation; a 7&#8208;fold increase relative to what is seen with other ligands. The results presented in this report overcome limitations in previously described C&#8722;O coupling methods and introduce a new ligand that we anticipate may be useful in other Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Involved Solvation Structure of Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of cationic lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and form contact ion pairs in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions and impacts the performance of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are pivotal intermediates involved in all the cathodic reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Elucidating the solvation structure of LiPSs is the first step for rational design of electrolyte and improving Li&#8722;S battery performances. Herein, we investigate the solvation structure of LiPSs and find that Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of LiPSs and form contact ion pairs in electrolyte. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. In particular, the LiPS solvation structure modified by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide endows Li&#8722;S batteries with reduced polarization and enhanced rate performances under high sulfur areal loading and lean electrolyte volume conditions. This work updates the fundamental understanding of the solvation chemistry of LiPSs and highlights electrolyte engineering for promoting the performances of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Extended Enrichment for Ultrasensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations by Long Blocker Displacement Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

Innovative long blocker design for mutation hotspots detection in colorectal cancer tissue samples. Long blocker extended enrichment region offers superior enrichment capability for variants in mutation&#8208;rich areas, streamlining detection. Unlike traditional blockers, LBDA&#8208;qPCR minimizes the need for multiple entities, optimizing comprehensive mutation analysis.







Abstract
Detecting low&#8208;frequency DNA mutations hotspots cluster is critical for cancer diagnosis but remains challenging. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is constrained by sensitivity, and allele&#8208;specific PCR is restricted by throughput. Here we develop a long blocker displacement amplification (LBDA) coupled with qPCR for ultrasensitive and multiplexed variants detection. By designing long blocker oligos to perfectly match wildtype sequences while mispairing with mutants, long blockers enable 14&#8211;44&#8197;nt enrichment regions which is 2&#8208;fold longer than normal BDA in the experiments. For wild template with a specific nucleotide, LBDA can detect different mutation types down to 0.5&#8201;% variant allele frequency (VAF) in one reaction, with median enrichment fold of 1,000 on 21&#8197;mutant DNA templates compared to the wild type. We applied LBDA&#8208;qPCR to detect KRAS and NRAS mutation hotspots, utilizing a single plex assay capable of covering 81&#8197;mutations and tested in synthetic templates and colorectal cancer tissue samples. Moreover, the mutation types were verified through Sanger sequencing, demonstrating concordance with results obtained from next generation sequencing. Overall, LBDA&#8208;qPCR provides a simple yet ultrasensitive approach for multiplexed detection of low VAF mutations hotspots, presenting a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Borolithochromes A, D and G</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, spiroborate natural products possessing polyaromatic ligands, were achieved by a strategy including a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a one&#8208;pot S&#8208;methylation/intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reaction/epoxide rearrangement. A method for the synthesis of heterocomplexes possessing different multicyclic aromatic ligands is also described.







Abstract
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, red pigments isolated from fossils of Jurassic putative red alga Solenopora jurassica, have been achieved. The benzo[gh]tetraphene skeletons of the borate ligands in these substances were constructed using Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of aryl dienes with naphthoquinone, followed by intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reactions. Complexation of these ligands with trimethyl borate generated homocomplexes, which upon sequential O&#8208;demethylation produced borolithochromes A and G. In the route to borolithochrome D, a heterocomplex was prepared by stepwise complexation of the ligands with 2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl dimethyl borate. The strategy devised to accomplish the first total synthesis of borolithochromes A, D and G should be applicable to the preparation of other borolithochromes as well as spiroborates possessing two fused polycyclic aromatic ligands.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Tolerance Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA) of solvents dominate their reductive stability and delineate the SEI formed on Li or silicon (Si) anodes. Electrolyte with a high reductive stability achieves a high retention rate of 82&#8201;% after 100 cycles in anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells.







Abstract
Lithium batteries employing Li or silicon (Si) anodes hold promise for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their cycling behavior encounters rapid capacity degradation due to the vulnerability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Though anion&#8208;derived SEIs mitigate this degradation, the unavoidable reduction of solvents introduces heterogeneity to SEIs, leading to fractures during cycling. Here, we elucidate how the reductive stability of solvents, dominated by the electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA), delineates the SEI formed on Li or Si anodes. Solvents exhibiting lower EPT and CDA demonstrate enhanced tolerance to reduction, resulting in inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs with homogeneity. Guided by these criteria, we synthesized three promising solvents tailored for Li or Si anodes. The decomposition of these solvents is dictated by their EPTs under similar solvation structures, imparting distinct characteristics to SEIs and impacting battery performance. The optimized electrolyte, 1&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N&#8208;Pyrrolidine&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81&#8201;% (1910&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). In anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82&#8201;% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

The optimized electrolyte, 1&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N-Pyrrolidine-trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81&#8201;% (1910&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). In anode-free Cu||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82&#8201;% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high-energy lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

A cyclic ammonium molecule 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenyl quinuclidinium and a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with excellent alkaline stability were successfully developed. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based (PGM&#8208;free) anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) with PAQ&#8208;5 achieved the highest current density (8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 2&#8197;V and the longest durability among all PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WEs reported so far.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange capacity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x was verified and retained in the ex situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ&#8208;5 was used in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based AEM&#8208;WE, achieving a high current density of 8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and excellent stability over 2446&#8197;h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl&#8208;quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi&#8208;topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Fluorinated Lithium Borate Main Salt Empowering Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;fluorinated lithium borate main salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) is designed to enhance cycling performance of practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The superior stability of LiFPB and the as&#8208;formed favorable CEI/SEI endow LMBs (50&#8197;&#956;m of lithium anode) excellent cycling stability even under high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and voltage (4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) conditions without any generation of HF.







Abstract
Traditional lithium salts are difficult to meet practical application demand of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under high voltages and temperatures. LiPF6, as the most commonly used lithium salt, still suffers from notorious moisture sensitivity and inferior thermal stability under those conditions. Here, we synthesize a lithium salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) comprising highly&#8208;fluorinated and borate functional groups to address the above issues. It is demonstrated that the LiFPB shows superior thermal and electrochemical stability without any HF generation under high temperatures and voltages. In addition, the LiFPB can form a protective outer&#8208;organic and inner&#8208;inorganic rich cathode electrolyte interphase on LiCoO2 (LCO) surface. Simultaneously, the FPB&#8722; anions tend to integrate into lithium ion solvation structure to form a favorable fast&#8208;ion conductive LiBxOy based solid electrolyte interphase on lithium (Li) anode. All these fantastic features of LiFPB endow LCO (1.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2)/Li metal cells excellent cycling under both high voltages and temperatures (e.g., 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 260&#8197;cycles at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 4.45&#8197;V), and even at an extremely elevated temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the important role of salt anions in determining the electrochemical performance of LMBs at both high temperature and voltage conditions.

         <title>Large Organic Polar Molecules Tailored Electrode Interfaces for Stable Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate was introduced to the carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, triggering a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, and tailoring both the anode and cathode interfaces with great ability to withstand stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are deemed as ones of the most promising energy storage devices for next electrification applications. However, the uneven Li electroplating process caused by the diffusion&#8208;limited Li+ transportation at the Li metal surface inherently promotes the formation of dendritic morphology and instable Li interphase, while the sluggish Li+ transfer kinetic can also cause lithiation&#8208;induced stress on the cathode materials suffering from serious structural stability. Herein, a novel electrolyte designing strategy is proposed to accelerate the Li+ transfer by introducing a trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate (LP) without significantly altering the electrolyte structure. The LP molecules can afford a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, enhancing both the bulk and interfacial Li+ transfer kinetic, and creating better anode/cathode interfaces to suppress the side reactions, resulting in much improved cycling efficiency of LMBs. Using LP&#8208;based electrolyte, the performance of LMB pouch cell with a practical capacity of ~1.5&#8197;Ah can be improved greatly. This strategy opens up a novel electrolyte designing route for reliable LMBs.

Coordination of B(C6F5)3 to 1 afforded diradical 2 by intramolecular integer electron transfer, which is reversible and photo&#8208;controllable. 2 can be obtained in one&#8208;pot reaction, and also displays excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.







Abstract
We have synthesized a quinone&#8208;incorporated bistriarylamine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) semiconductor 1 by B(C6F5)3 (BCF) catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross coupling via radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of Lewis acids BCF and Al(ORF)3 (RF=C(CF3)3) to the semiconductor 1 afforded diradical zwitterions 2 and 3 by integer electron transfer. Upon binding to Lewis acids, the LUMO energy of 1 is significantly lowered and the band gap of the semiconductor is significantly narrowed from 1.93&#8197;eV (1) to 1.01&#8197;eV (2) and 1.06&#8197;eV (3). 2 and 3 are rare near&#8208;infrared (NIR) diradical dyes with broad absorption both centered around 1500&#8197;nm. By introducing a photo BCF generator, 2 can be generated by light&#8208;dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH3CN. In addition, the temperature of 2 sharply increased and reached as high as 110&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8197;s upon the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) laser (1064&#8197;nm, 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2), exhibiting a fast response to laser. It displays excellent photothermal stability with a photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.

Coordination of B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; afforded diradical &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; by intramolecular integer electron transfer, which is reversible and photo-controllable. &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; can be obtained in one-pot reaction, and also displays excellent NIR-II photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high-quality PT imaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have synthesized a quinone-incorporated bistriarylamine donor-acceptor-donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) semiconductor &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; by B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BCF) catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross coupling via radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of Lewis acids BCF and Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the semiconductor &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; afforded diradical zwitterions &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; by integer electron transfer. Upon binding to Lewis acids, the LUMO energy of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is significantly lowered and the band gap of the semiconductor is significantly narrowed from 1.93&#8197;eV (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) to 1.01&#8197;eV (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and 1.06&#8197;eV (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are rare near-infrared (NIR) diradical dyes with broad absorption both centered around 1500&#8197;nm. By introducing a photo BCF generator, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; can be generated by light-dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN. In addition, the temperature of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; sharply increased and reached as high as 110&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8197;s upon the irradiation of near-infrared-II (NIR-II) laser (1064&#8197;nm, 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), exhibiting a fast response to laser. It displays excellent photothermal stability with a photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high-quality PT imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COF) exhibits ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps). A favorable H2O2 generation mechanism via Yeager&#8208;type *O2&#8226;&#8208; intermediates in the cyanide active site can be demonstrated. These features contribute to an excellent hydrogen peroxide yield rate of 11&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in pure water.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising route to providing oxidants for various industrial applications. However, the lack of well&#8208;designed photocatalysts for efficient overall H2O2 production in pure water has impeded ongoing research and practical thrusts. Here we present a cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COFs) combining 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TBTN) and benzotrithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde (BTT) building blocks with water&#8208;affinity and charge&#8208;separation. The ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps) can be realized by TBTN&#8208;COF, resulting in a hole accumulated BTT and electron&#8208;rich TBTN building block. Under one sun, the 11013&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 yield rate of H2O2 can be achieved without any sacrificial agent, outperforming most previous reports. Furthermore, the DFT calculation and in situ DRIFTS spectrums suggesting a Yeager&#8208;type absorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in the cyanide active site, which prohibits the formation of superoxide radical and revealing a favored H2O2 production pathway.

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Fluoroalkylation through Ligand Coupling Reaction of Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes are efficiently synthesized from fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones via Grignard reagent&#8208;promoted formal SO2 extrusion reaction. The reaction proceeds through the ligand coupling of a pentacoordinate sulfur(VI) intermediate and exhibits unique fluorine effect.







Abstract
Ligand coupling on hypervalent main group elements has emerged as a pivotal methodology for the synthesis of functionalized N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds in recent years due to the avoidance of transition metals and the mildness of the reaction conditions. In this direction, the reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfur(IV) and N&#8208;heteroaryl phosphorus(V) compounds has been well studied. However, the ligand coupling of sulfur(VI) is still underdeveloped and the reaction of alkyl N&#8208;heteroarylsulfones is still elusive, which does not match the high status of sulfones as the chemical chameleons in organic synthesis. Here we present a ligand coupling&#8208;enabled formal SO2 extrusion of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones under the promotion of Grignard reagents, which not only enriches the chemistry of sulfones, but also provides a novel and practical synthetic tool towards N&#8208;heteroaromatic fluoroalkylation.

Molecule and microstructure modulations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes craft a groundbreaking CNT@PFDCB with core&#8211;shell heterostructure, which breaks through the limitations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes including inevitable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. As a result, the novel CNT@PFDCB achieves high capacity, elevated voltage, superior rate ability, and exceptional cycling stability, standing out among the reported organic cathodes.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;containing electrodes usually promise high theoretical potentials while suffering from uncontrollable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, to remedy their limitations, an unprecedented core&#8211;shell heterostructured electrode of carbon nanotubes encapsulated in poly(1,4&#8208;dicyanoperfluorobenzene sulfide) (CNT@PFDCB) is rationally crafted via molecule and microstructure modulations. Specifically, the linkage of sulfide bridges of PFDCB prevents the active cyano groups from dissolving, resulting in a robust structure. The fluorinations modulate the electronic configurations in frontier orbitals, allowing higher electrical conductivity and elevated output voltage. Combined with the core&#8211;shell architecture to unlock the sluggish diffusion kinetics for both electrons and guest ions, the CNT@PFDCB exhibits an impressive capacity (203.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate ability (127.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability (retaining 81.1&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Additionally, the Li&#8208;storage mechanisms regarding PFDCB are thoroughly revealed by in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations, which involve the coordination interaction between Li ions and cyano groups and the electron delocalization along the conjugated skeleton. More importantly, a practical fully organic cell based on the CNT@PFDCB is well&#8208;validated that demonstrates a tremendous potential of cyanopolymer as the cathode to replace its inorganic counterparts.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Electron Redistribution in Lattice&#8208;Matched Biphasic Ni3N&#8208;Co3N for Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production via Coupled Hydrazine Degradation</title>

Mn functions as an electric field engine, activating electronic redistribution at the interface of Ni3N&#8208;Co3N with highly lattice&#8208;matched lattices, thereby enabling energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production coupled with hydrazine degradation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;purity and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density green hydrogen through water electrolysis holds immense promise, but issues such as electrocatalyst costs and power consumption have hampered its practical application. In this study, we present a promising solution to these challenges through the use of a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production via coupled hydrazine degradation. The biphasic metal nitrides with highly lattice&#8208;matched structures are deliberately constructed, forming an enhanced local electric field between the electron&#8208;rich Ni3N and electron&#8208;deficient Co3N.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-purity and high-energy-density green hydrogen through water electrolysis holds immense promise, but issues such as electrocatalyst costs and power consumption have hampered its practical application. In this study, we present a promising solution to these challenges through the use of a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy-efficient hydrogen production via coupled hydrazine degradation. The biphasic metal nitrides with highly lattice-matched structures are deliberately constructed, forming an enhanced local electric field between the electron-rich Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N and electron-deficient Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N.

         <title>Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Efficient Electrochemical Water Dissociation and Dechlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immobilization of Co single atoms on the surface oxide layer of titanium foam favors the rapid diffusion of generated atomic hydrogen to adjacent Co single atoms through the reverse hydrogen spillover effect for more efficient electrochemical dechlorination of chloramphenicol, offering a promising atomic hydrogen utilization strategy for environmental and energy applications.







Abstract
Efficient water dissociation to atomic hydrogen (H*) with restrained recombination of H* is crucial for improving the H* utilization for electrochemical dechlorination, but is currently limited by the lack of feasible electrodes. Herein, we developed a monolithic single&#8208;atom electrode with Co single atoms anchored on the inherent oxide layer of titanium foam (Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti), which can efficiently dissociate water into H* and simultaneously inhibit the recombination of H*, by taking advantage of the single&#8208;atom reverse hydrogen spillover effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrated that H* could be rapidly generated on the oxide layer of titanium foam, and then overflowed to the adjacent Co single atom for the reductive dechlorination. Using chloramphenicol as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept verification, the resulting Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti monolithic electrode exhibited an unprecedented performance with almost 100&#8201;% dechlorination at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V, far superior to that of traditional indirect reduction&#8208;driven commercial Pd/C (52&#8201;%) and direct reduction&#8208;driven Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (44&#8201;%). Moreover, its dechlorination rate constant of 1.64&#8197;h&#8722;1 was 4.3 and 8.6 times more active than those of Pd/C (0.38&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (0.19&#8197;h&#8722;1), respectively. Our research sheds light on the rational design of hydrogen spillover&#8208;related electrocatalysts to simultaneously improve the H* generation, transfer, and utilization for environmental and energy applications.

         <title>Aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes&#8212;Formation and Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of &#951;5&#8208;alumole complexes of Ge(II) 3 is reported. The alumole complex 3 (R1=NCy2) is in equilibrium with its isomeric aluminylene germole complex 4. This equilibrium between aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes 3 and 4 marks an intriguing example for an exchange of two heteroatoms at the apical position of a pentagonal pyramidal structure under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The salt metathesis reaction of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediide with aluminum(III) dichlorides provides either half&#8208;sandwich alumole complexes of germanium(II) or aluminylene germole complexes. Their molecular structure and the delocalized bonding situation, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are equally described as isomeric aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes with either the germanium or the aluminum atom in the apical position of the pentagonal pyramid. The product formation and the selectivity of the reaction depends on the third substituent of the aluminum dichloride. Aryl&#8208;substituents favor the formation of alumole complexes and Cp*&#8208;substituents that of the isomeric germole complexes. With amino&#8208;substituents at the aluminum atom mixtures of both isomers are formed and the positional exchange of the two heteroatoms is shown by NMR spectroscopy. The alumole complexes of germanium(II) undergo facile reductive elimination of germanium and form the corresponding alumoles.

         <title>Rocking&#8208;Chair Aqueous Fluoride&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous fluoride ion battery with the development of electrolytes with KOAc&#8208;KF binary salts is constructed, which exhibits concurrent fluorination or defluorination reactions occurring at both cathode and anode electrodes. Weakening of the F&#8722;&#8722;H2O hydrogen bonding by OAc&#8722; anion in the electrolyte is responsible for the optimized electrochemical process.







Abstract
Aqueous fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered attention for their high theoretical energy density, yet they are challenged by sluggish fluorination kinetics, active material dissolution, and electrolyte instability. Here, we present a room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous FIBs featuring KOAc&#8208;KF binary salt electrolytes, enabling concurrent fluorination and defluorination reactions at both cathode and anode electrodes. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that acetate ions in the electrolyte compete with fluoride ions in hydrogen bonding formation, weakening the excessively strong solvation between H2O and F&#8722; ions. This results in the suppression of detrimental HF formation and a reduced desolvation energy of F&#8722; ions, enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The bismuth&#8208;based cathode exhibits direct conversion in the optimized electrolyte, effectively suppressing the detrimental disproportionation reactions from Bi2+ intermediates. Additionally, zinc anode undergoes a typical fluorination process, forming solid KZnF3 as the electrode product, minimizing the risks of hydrogen evolution. The proposed aqueous FIBs with the optimized electrolyte demonstrate high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capabilities.

         <title>Two Sesterterpene Synthases from Lentzea atacamensis Demonstrate the Role of Conformational Variability in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of Lentzea atacamensis uncovered two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases with the main products lentzeadiene and atacamatriene. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was observed, reminiscent of vitamin D3 biosynthesis. The cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations, showing the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.







Abstract
Mining of two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases from Lentzea atacamensis resulted in the identification of the synthases for lentzeadiene (LaLDS) and atacamatriene (LaATS). The main product of LaLDS (lentzeadiene) is a new compound, while one of the side products (lentzeatetraene) is the enantiomer of brassitetraene B and the other side product (sestermobaraene F) is known from a surprisingly distantly related sesterterpene synthase. LaATS produces six new compounds, one of which is the enantiomer of the known sesterterpene Bm1. Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.

Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of Ions on the Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that the type and concentration of dissolved salts dictate the thermodynamics of the electrolytic reactions of aqueous electrolytes, whereas the whole picture of the mechanism remains elusive. Besides the varying O&#8722;H bond strength, we found the essential contribution from the hydration energies of protons and hydroxides, the products of OER and HER, respectively. The findings will reshape the design principles of the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
The electrochemical stability window of water is known to vary with the type and concentration of dissolved salts. However, the underlying influence of ions on the thermodynamic stability of aqueous solutions has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the electrolytic behaviors of aqueous electrolytes as a function of different ions. Our findings indicate that ions with high ionic potentials, i.e., charge density, promote the formation of their respective hydration structures, enhancing electrolytic reactions via an inductive effect, particularly for small cations. Conversely, ions with lower ionic potentials increase the proportion of free water molecules&#8212;those not engaged in hydration shells or hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks&#8212;leading to greater electrolytic stability. Furthermore, we observe that the chemical environment created by bulky ions with lower ionic potentials impedes electrolytic reactions by frustrating the solvation of protons and hydroxide ions, the products of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. We found that the solvation of protons plays a more substantial role than that of hydroxide, which explains a greater shift for OER than for HER, a puzzle that cannot be rationalized by the notion of varying O&#8722;H bond strengths of water. These insights will help the design of aqueous systems.

         <title>Porous Ceramic Metal&#8208;Based Flow Battery Composite Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid hierarchical porous ceramic MF membrane coated with small amounts of a polyelectrolyte was used in a zinc&#8208;iron flow battery. The rigid porous structure of the ceramic membrane not only provided fast ion transport channels but also prevented dendrite formation and enhanced zinc deposition within the ceramic cavities, significantly increasing the areal capacity up to 260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintained an average EE of &gt;80&#8201;% for more than 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
In metal&#8208;based flow battery, membranes significantly impact energy conversion efficiency and security. Unfortunately, damages to the membrane occur due to gradual accumulation of metal dendrites, causing short circuits and shortening cycle life. Herein, we developed a rigid hierarchical porous ceramic flow battery composite membrane with a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polyelectrolyte coating to achieve high ion selectivity and conductivity, to restrain dendrite, and to realize long cycle life and high areal capacity. An aqueous zinc&#8208;iron flow battery prepared using this membrane achieved an outstanding energy efficiency of &gt;80%, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability (over 1000&#8197;h) and extremely high areal capacity (260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, in situ infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, and nano&#8208;computed tomography revealed that the rigid hierarchical pore structures and numerous hydrogen bonding networks in the membrane contributed to the stable operation and superior battery performance. This study contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based flow battery membranes for energy and power generation.

         <title>Unlocking Four&#8208;electron Conversion in Tellurium Cathodes for Advanced Magnesium&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a magnesium aluminum chloride complex electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 additive, a four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion is initiated in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of high&#8208;performance Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. The Mg(TFSI)2 additive is uncovered to play a crucial role in facilitating Cl&#8722; dissociation and mitigating corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes.







Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) batteries hold promise as a large&#8208;scale energy storage solution, but their progress has been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Here, we address this challenge by unlocking the reversible four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of superior Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. Specifically, the classic magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte is tailored by introducing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2), which initiates the Te0/Te4+ conversion with two distinct charge&#8208;storage steps. Te cathode undergoes Te/TeCl4 conversion involving Cl&#8722; as charge carriers, during which a tellurium subchloride phase is presented as an intermediate. Significantly, the Te cathode achieves a high specific capacity of 543&#8197;mAh&#8201;gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 850&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgTe&#8722;1, outperforming most of the previously reported cathodes. Our electrolyte analysis indicates that the addition of Mg(TFSI)2 reduces the overall ion&#8208;molecule interaction and mitigates the strength of ion&#8208;solvent aggregation within the MACC electrolyte, which implies the facilized Cl&#8722; dissociation from the electrolyte. Besides, Mg(TFSI)2 is verified as an essential buffer to mitigate the corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes caused by the consumption of the electrolyte MgCl2 in Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion cells. These findings provide crucial insights into the development of advanced Mg&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Labile Polyoxometalates for Catalysis in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of labile polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solutions has been achieved within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble coordination cage. This encapsulation significantly enhances the stability of these POMs in water, rendering them into green catalysts with high reactivity and selectivity. This cavity&#8208;directed approach represents the first example of utilizing the coordination cage for synthesizing metallic clusters.







Abstract
The artificial microenvironments inside coordination cages have gained significant attention for performing enzyme&#8208;like catalytic reactions by facilitating the formation of labile and complex molecules through a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; approach. Despite many fascinating examples, this approach remains scarcely explored in the context of synthesizing metallic clusters such as polyoxometalates (POMs). The development of innovative approaches to control and influence the speciation of POMs in aqueous solutions would greatly advance their applicability and could ultimately lead to the formation of elusive clusters that cannot be synthesized by using traditional methods. In this study, we employ host&#8211;guest stabilization within a coordination cage to enable a novel cavity&#8208;directed synthesis of labile POMs in aqueous solutions under mild conditions. The elusive Lindqvist [M6O19]2&#8722; (M=Mo or W) POMs were successfully synthesized at room temperature via the condensation of molybdate or tungstate building blocks within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble Pt6L4(NO3)12 coordination cage. Importantly, the encapsulation of these POMs enhances their stability in water, rendering them efficient catalysts for environmentally friendly and selective sulfoxidation reactions using H2O2 as a green oxidant in a pure aqueous medium. The approach developed in this paper offers a means to synthesize and stabilize the otherwise unstable metal&#8208;oxo clusters in water, which can broaden the scope of their applications.

         <title>Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 over CeO2 with Electron&#8208;Enriched Lattice Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron enriched lattice oxygen species provided abundant base sites for CO2 adsorption and simultaneously facilitated the weakly absorbed methoxy formation, thus shifting the rate determining&#8208;step from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation and lowering the energy barrier of dimethyl carbonate synthesis.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 plays an important role in carbon neutrality, but its efficiency is still far from the practical application, due to the limited understanding of the reaction mechanism and rational design of efficient catalyst. Herein, abundant electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen species were introduced into CeO2 catalyst by constructing the point defects and crystal&#8208;terminated phases in the crystal reconstruction process. Benefitting from the acid&#8208;base properties modulated by the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, the optimized CeO2 catalyst exhibited a much higher DMC yield of 22.2 mmol g&#8208;1 than the reported metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalysts at the similar conditions. Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can provide abundant sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, and was advantageous of the formation of the weakly adsorbed active methoxy species. These were facilitating to the coupling of methoxy and CO2 for the key *CH3OCOO intermediate formation. More importantly, the weakened adsorption of *CH3OCOO on the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can switch the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS) of DMC synthesis from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation, and lower the corresponding activation barriers, thus giving rise to a high performance. This work provides insights into the underlying reaction mechanism for DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol and the design of highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>Synchronous Regulation of D&#8211;Band Centers in Zn Substrates and Weakening Pauli Repulsion of Zn Ions Using the Ascorbic Acid Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vitamin C molecule tends to regulate the d band center of the Zn substrate as well as adjust the solvation structure. Under this circumstance, active H+ was fixed to the Zn substrate so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was restrained, and the Zn deposition was uniform.







Abstract
The advanced aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) are still challenging due to the harmful reactions including hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a natural small molecule acid vitamin C (Vc) as an aqueous electrolyte additive has been selectively identified. The small molecule Vc can adjust the d band center of Zn substrate which fixes the active H+ so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is restrained. Simultaneously, it could also fine&#8211;tune the solvation structure of Zn ions due to the enhanced electrostatics and reduced Pauli repulsion verified by energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Hence, the cell retains an ultra&#8211;long cycle performance of over 1300&#8197;cycles and a superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5&#8201;%. The prepared full cells display increased rate capability, cycle lifetime, and self&#8211;discharge suppression. Our results shed light on the mechanistic principle of electrolyte additives on the performance improvement of ZIBs, which is anticipated to render a new round of studies.

         <title>Lowering Entropic Barriers in Triplex DNA Switches Facilitating Biomedical Applications at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short dsDNA&#8208;containing clamp&#8208;like triplex nanoswitch, termed CTNSds, was constructed. The CTNSds design could reduce the entropic barriers (&#8722;T&#9653;S) associated with the formation of a triplex motif, thereby increasing its triplex&#8208;forming ratio to 91&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.4, which was nearly three times higher than that of the classical clamp&#8208;like triplex nanoswitch.







Abstract
Triplex DNA switches are attractive allosteric tools for engineering smart nanodevices, but their poor triplex&#8208;forming capacity at physiological conditions limited the practical applications. To address this challenge, we proposed a low&#8208;entropy barrier design to facilitate triplex formation by introducing a hairpin duplex linker into the triplex motif, and the resulting triplex switch was termed as CTNSds. Compared to the conventional clamp&#8208;like triplex switch, CTNSds increased the triplex&#8208;forming ratio from 30&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.4 and stabilized the triple&#8208;helix structure in FBS and cell lysate. CTNSds was also less sensitive to free&#8208;energy disturbances, such as lengthening linkers or mismatches in the triple&#8208;helix stem. The CTNSds design was utilized to reversibly isolate CTCs from whole blood, achieving high capture efficiencies (&gt;86&#8201;%) at pH&#8197;7.4 and release efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%) at pH&#8197;8.0. Our approach broadens the potential applications of DNA switches&#8208;based switchable nanodevices, showing great promise in biosensing and biomedicine.

         <title>Turning Non&#8208;Emissive Schiff Bases Into Aggregate Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy to turn non&#8208;emissive Schiff bases into aggregate emitters has been realized. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.







Abstract
Schiff bases are a crucial component in various functional materials but often exhibit non&#8208;emissive behavior which significantly limits their potential applications as luminescent materials. However, traditional approaches to convert them into aggregate emitters often require intricate molecular design, tedious synthesis, and significant time and resource consumption. Herein, we present a cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy that can transform non&#8208;emissive (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted Schiff bases into green&#8208;yellow to yellow aggregate emitters via even simple grinding of a mixture of Schiff bases and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCB) mixtures. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the cocrystallization inhibits the C=N isomerization and promotes face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, which restricts access to both the dark state and canonical intersection to ultimately induce emission. Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid&#8208;state molecular diffusion through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.

         <title>Unveiling the Mysteries: Acetonitrile's Dance with Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes in Shaping Gas Evolution and Electrochemical Performance of Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetonitrile electrolyte additive is found to delay hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). It also suppresses vanadium (V) dissolution, or V&#8208;ion crosstalk, from the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) cathode. Practically, acetonitrile&#8208;added electrolyte enabled a high and stable areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using a 26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 V2O5 dry&#8208;film cathode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal battery (AZMB) is a promising candidate for future large&#8208;scale energy storage with commendable capacity, exceptional safety characteristics, and low cost. Acetonitrile (AN) has been widely used as an effective electrolyte constituent to improve AZMBs&#8217; performance. However, its functioning mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we unveiled the critical roles of AN in AZMBs via comparative in situ electrochemical, gaseous, and morphological analyses. Despite its limited ability to solvate Zn ions, AN&#8208;modulated Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheath with increased anions and decreased water achieves a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte. As a result, the Zn||Zn cell with AN addition exhibited 63&#8197;times longer cycle life than cell without AN and achieved a 4&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accumulated capacity with no H2 generation. In V2O5||Zn cells, for the first time, AN suppressing CO2 generation, elevating CO2&#8208;initiation voltage from 2&#8594;2.44&#8197;V (H2: 2.43&#8594;2.55&#8197;V) was discovered. AN&#8208;impeded transit and Zn&#8208;side deposition of dissolved vanadium ions, known as &#8220;crosstalk,&#8221; ameliorated inhomogeneous Zn deposition and dendritic Zn growth. At last, we demonstrated an AN&#8208;enabled high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity AZMB (3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) using high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading V2O5 cathode (26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This study shed light on the strategy of constructing fast&#8208;desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high&#8208;voltage AZMB cathodes.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Sulfur Conversion for Energetic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that direct one&#8208;step reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling was proposed. And the tandem electrocatalysis manipulated tunable quasi&#8208;solid sulfur redox chemistry smoothen the efficient entrapping&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion polysulfide speciation for practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The high theoretical energy density (1274&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and high safety enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries with great promise for stationary energy storage system. However, the uncontrollable solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase conversion and its associated sluggish polysulfides redox kinetics pose a great challenge in tunning the sulfur speciation pathway for practical Na&#8722;S electrochemistry. Herein, we propose a new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that control the multi&#8208;step polysulfide transformation in tandem and direct quasi&#8208;solid reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling. It is revealed that the N, P heteroatom hotspots are more favorable for catalyzing the long&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while PtNi nanocrystals manipulate the direct and full Na2S4 to Na2S low&#8208;kinetic conversion during discharging. The electrodeposited Na2S on strongly coupled PtNi and N, P&#8208;codoped carbon host is extremely electroreactive and can be readily recovered back to S8 without passivation of active species during battery recharging, which delivers a true tandem electrocatalytic quasi&#8208;solid sulfur conversion mechanism. Accordingly, stable cycling of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;package Na&#8722;S pouch cells with an attractive specific capacity of 876&#8197;mAh gS&#8722;1 and a high energy of 608&#8197;Wh kgcathode&#8722;1 (172&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the total mass of cathode and anode) at 60&#8201;&#176;C are demonstrated.

         <title>Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol&#8208;Yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry, the energy&#8208;rich and reductive carborane subunits were covalently incorporated into the pores of energetic frameworks. This innovative decoration approach enables integrate multiple functionalities, ultimately achieving enhanced energy density, improved safety and shortened ignition delay time of the energetic frameworks.







Abstract
Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well&#8208;established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol&#8208;yne coupling, a versatile metal&#8208;free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy&#8208;rich, size&#8208;matched, and reductive 1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol (CB&#8722;SH) into an acetylene&#8208;functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2, via thiol&#8208;yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6&#8201;% increase in energy density, a six&#8208;fold reduction in ignition delay time (4&#8197;ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB&#8722;SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol&#8208;yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials.

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that a special loop structure of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 incorporated into the network enables substantial energy dissipation and exceptional elasticity, significantly enhancing mechanical performance, while the recognition of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and guest molecules, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts, significantly enhances the recovery performance of the material.







Abstract
Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Siderophore Mimics Convey Nucleic Acid Therapeutics into Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

Synthetic siderophores are conjugated to antibacterial antisense sequences to efficiently deliver them into bacteria. The conjugates display effective protein downregulation and potent antibacterial properties. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore demonstrate transport through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway.







Abstract
Antibacterial resistance is a major threat for human health. There is a need for new antibacterials to stay ahead of constantly&#8208;evolving resistant bacteria. Nucleic acid therapeutics hold promise as powerful antibiotics, but issues with their delivery hamper their applicability. Here, we exploit the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway to efficiently transport antisense oligomers into bacteria. We appended a synthetic siderophore to antisense oligomers targeting the essential acpP gene in Escherichia coli. Siderophore&#8208;conjugated PNA and PMO antisense oligomers displayed potent antibacterial properties. Conjugates bearing a minimal siderophore consisting of a mono&#8208;catechol group showed equally effective. Targeting the lacZ transcript resulted in dose&#8208;dependent decreased &#946;&#8208;galactosidase production, demonstrating selective protein downregulation. Applying this concept to Acinetobacter baumannii also showed concentration&#8208;dependent growth inhibition. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore verified selective uptake through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway. Lastly, no toxicity towards mammalian cells was found. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that large nucleic acid therapeutics can be efficiently transported into bacteria using synthetic siderophore mimics.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shift as a Probe for Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical shift observed in NMR spectroscopy has been recently found to be a descriptor for the frontier molecular orbitals of organic/organometallic compounds. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that it can be applied to rationalise charge transport through such compounds, equipping the molecular electronics toolbox with another useful technique.







Abstract
Existing modelling tools, developed to aid the design of efficient molecular wires and to better understand their charge&#8208;transport behaviour and mechanism, have limitations in accuracy and computational cost. Further research is required to develop faster and more precise methods that can yield information on how charge transport properties are impacted by changes in the chemical structure of a molecular wire. In this study, we report a clear semilogarithmic correlation between charge transport efficiency and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in multiple series of molecular wires, also accounting for the presence of chemical substituents. The NMR data was used to inform a simple tight&#8208;binding model that accurately captures the experimental single&#8208;molecule conductance values, especially useful in this case as more sophisticated density functional theory calculations fail due to inherent limitations. Our study demonstrates the potential of NMR spectroscopy as a valuable tool for characterising, rationalising, and gaining additional insights on the charge transport properties of single&#8208;molecule junctions.

         <title>Electrostatic Field in Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Driven C&#8722;F Bond Cleavage of Perfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel approach using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the catalyst under low frequency ultrasound irradiation to degrade perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). A strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF) on PTFE surface has shown great success in triggering C&#8722;F bond cleavage and achieving near&#8208;complete defluorination. This catalytic mechanism brings new PFASs treatment technologies for sustainable demands.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent and toxic to human health. It is demanding for high&#8208;efficient and green technologies to remove PFASs from water. In this study, a novel PFAS treatment technology was developed, utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (1&#8211;5&#8197;&#956;m) as the catalyst and a low frequency ultrasound (US, 40&#8197;kHz, 0.3&#8197;W/cm2) for activation. Remarkably, this system can induce near&#8208;complete defluorination for different structured PFASs. The underlying mechanism relies on contact electrification between PTFE and water, which induces cumulative electrons on PTFE surface, and creates a high surface voltage (tens of volts). Such high surface voltage can generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., O2&#8901;&#8722;, HO&#8901;, etc.) and a strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF of 109~1010&#8197;V/m). Consequently, the strong IEF significantly activates PFAS molecules and reduces the energy barrier of O2&#8901;&#8722; nucleophilic reaction. Simultaneously, the co&#8208;existence of surface electrons (PTFE*(e&#8722;)) and HO&#8901; enables synergetic reduction and oxidation of PFAS and its intermediates, leading to enhanced and thorough defluorination. The US/PTFE method shows compelling advantages of low energy consumption, zero chemical input, and few harmful intermediates. It offers a new and promising solution for effectively treating the PFAS&#8208;contaminated drinking water.

         <title>Binding FSI&#8722; to Construct a Self&#8208;Healing SEI Film for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries by In situ Crosslinking Vinyl Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing SEI film containing bound FSI&#8722; anions as repairing agent is constructed via the cross&#8208;linking of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) to improve the performances of lithium anode. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite.







Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane on the Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self&#8208;healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li&#8208;electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film&#8208;forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self&#8208;healing film fixing FSI&#8722; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li. This study presents a new design approach for self&#8208;healing Li metal anodes and durable lithium metal battery.

Silanol elimination leads to a substantial improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in the photoluminescence quantum yield of CsPbBr3 NCs confined in mesoporous silica.







Abstract
The detriments of intrinsic silanol groups in mesoporous silica to the photoluminescence (PL) of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) confined in the template have never been determined and clearly elucidated. Here, we disclose that silanol&#8208;induced Cs+ and Br&#8722; deficiencies prompt the generation of traps and CsPb2Br5 impurities. The temperature&#8208;dependent PL spectra verify the higher energetic barrier of trap states in CsPbBr3 NCs confined in silanol&#8208;rich mesoporous silica. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra reveal the trapped state mediates a broadband photoinduced absorption and long&#8208;lived decay pathway of CsPbBr3 NCs in silanol&#8208;rich templates. A remarkable improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in PL quantum yields is realized by simple silanol elimination. This work demonstrates the detrimental effects of silanol sites on the PL properties of LHP NCs impregnated in mesoporous silica and provides a new perspective for the ligand&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;quality LHP NCs in mesoporous templates by facile impregnation for practical applications.

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the ROP of bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), yielding chemically recyclable nylon with high molecular weight (up to 75.7&#8197;kDa) and impressive thermostability (up to 283&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, the 5/6&#8208;LM can be scaled to 50&#8197;g per batch in the lab, with the efficient recycling of the Pd/C catalyst and methanol over 8 cycles, highlighting the process&#8216;s efficiency and promising scalability for future applications.







Abstract
Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95&#8201;% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50&#8197;g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#8201;&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Diorganyl Bis(pyridylimino) Isoindolide Aluminum(III) Complexes and Their Organometallic Radical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the synthesis of varied bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide aluminum complexes and a detailed study of its charge&#8208;transfer induced metal&#8208;carbon bond homolysis in a transition&#8208;metal mimicking fashion as well as following reactivity studies.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a series of (mostly) air&#8208;stable diorganyl bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide (BPI) aluminum complexes and their chemistry upon visible&#8208;light excitation. The redox non&#8208;innocent BPI pincer ligand allows for efficient charge transfer homolytic processes of the title compounds. This makes them a universal platform for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals. The photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of the Al&#8722;C bonds was investigated by means of stationary and transient UV/Vis spectroscopy, spin trapping experiments, as well as EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental findings were supported by quantum chemical calculations. Reactivity studies enabled the utilization of the aluminum complexes as reactants in tin&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type reactions and carbonyl alkylations under ambient conditions, which both indicated radical&#8208;polar crossover behavior. A deeper understanding of the physical fundamentals and photochemical process was provided, furnishing in turn a new strategy to control the reactivity of bench&#8208;stable aluminum organometallics.

This approach enables the cavity&#8208;directed synthesis of otherwise unstable polyoxometalates (POM) employing a coordination cage. The image captures the essence of innovation and sustainability, with the water and shimmering lights symbolizing the transformative potential of this novel concept in synthesizing complex molecules and facilitating green and sustainable catalysis, as demonstrated by Cui&#8208;Lian Liu, Tatjana&#8197;N.

The chelating ligand of one of the title complexes shown on the cover picture is coordinated by three nitrogen donors (blue) to the central aluminum atom (wine&#8208;red). The latter consists of two more substituents, i.e. two phenyl rings. One of these phenyl rings is &#8220;blown&#8221; away by the wave of light coming from the right of the picture. The homolytic bond rupture event is highlighted and the phenyl ring flying away is shown in red due to its &#8220;hot&#8221;, i.e. radical nature. Details of the study are reported by Andreas&#8208;Neil Unterreiner, Frank Breher et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402885).

Lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, n=4&#8722;8) serve as vital intermediates in Li&#8211;S batteries. However, the solvation structure of LiPSs in electrolyte remains elusive, especially regarding how LiPSs interact with other electrolyte components and form specific ion&#8722;solvent complexes. In their Research Article (e202400343), Bo&#8208;Quan Li, Qiang Zhang et&#8197;al. systematically investigate the specific solvation structure of LiPSs in electrolyte and pioneeringly find that Li salt anions are favored to enter the first solvation sheath of cationic LiPSs and form contact ion pairs, which updates the basic understanding towards the ion&#8211;solvent interaction in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Charge Transfer Dynamics in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Heterostructures&#8212;Insights by Vibrational&#8208;Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intricate structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid heterostructures used in organic photovoltaics, DSSCs, and organic optoelectronics demand an in&#8208;depth investigation of their functional interface. This minireview offers a perspective on the application of time&#8208;resolved vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy for exploring the charge dynamics and their influence on the interfacial structure of these devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures play a pivotal role in modern electronic and optoelectronic applications including photodetectors and field effect transistors, as well as in solar energy conversion such as photoelectrodes of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and in organic photovoltaics. To a large extent, performance of such devices is controlled by charge transfer dynamics at and across (inner) interfaces, e.g., between a wide band gap semiconductor and molecular sensitizers and/or catalysts. Hence, a detailed understanding of the structure&#8208;dynamics&#8208;function relationship of such functional interfaces is necessary to rationalize possible performance limitations of these materials and devices on a molecular level. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, as an interface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic technique, allows to obtain chemically specific information from interfaces and combines such chemical insights with ultrafast time resolution, when integrated as a spectroscopic probe into a pump&#8208;probe scheme. Thus, this minireview discusses the advantages and potential of VSFG spectroscopy for investigating interfacial charge transfer dynamics and structural changes at inner interfaces. A critical perspective of the unique spectroscopic view of otherwise inaccessible interfaces is presented, which we hope opens new opportunities for an improved understanding of function&#8208;determining processes in complex materials, and brings together communities who are devoted to designing materials and devices with spectroscopists.

         <title>Palladium (II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation with Bifunctional Ligands: From Curiosity to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

In 2001, our curiosity about the stereochemistry of Pd C&#8722;H metalation prompted our research into Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Since then, we have developed many new strategies to solve the four central challenges of reactivity, site&#8208;selectivity, enantioselectivity, and practicality.







Abstract
In 2001, our curiosity to understand the stereochemistry of C&#8722;H metalation with Pd prompted our first studies in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation (RSC Research appointment: 020 7451 2545, Grant: RG 36873, Dec. 2002). We identified four central challenges: 1.&#8197;poor reactivity of simple Pd salts with native substrates; 2.&#8197;few strategies to control site selectivity for remote C&#8722;H bonds; 3.&#8197;the lack of chiral catalysts to achieve enantioselectivity via asymmetric C&#8722;H metalation, and 4.&#8197;low practicality due to limited coupling partner scope and the use of specialized oxidants. These challenges necessitated new strategies in catalyst and reaction development. For reactivity, we developed approaches to enhance substrate&#8211;catalyst affinity together with novel bifunctional ligands which participate in and accelerate the C&#8722;H cleavage step. For site&#8208;selectivity, we introduced the concept of systematically modulating the distance and geometry between a directing template, catalyst, and substrate to selectively access remote C&#8722;H bonds. For enantioselectivity, we devised predictable stereomodels for catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective C&#8722;H activation based on the participation of bifunctional ligands. Finally, for practicality, we have developed varied catalytic manifolds for Pd(II) to accommodate diverse coupling partners while employing practical oxidants such as simple peroxides. These advances have culminated in numerous C&#8722;H activation reactions, setting the stage for broad industrial applications.

         <title>Circular Dichroism Sensing: Strategies and Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiroptical sensing of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric ratio and concentration of organic compounds has developed into a mature field with practical applications, including high&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction screening and chromatography&#8208;free analysis of multicompound mixtures. This review covers fundamental milestones and highlights recent advances with machine learning assistance, chemometric data processing and other developments.







Abstract
The analysis of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition, and concentration of chiral compounds are frequently encountered tasks across the chemical and health sciences. Chiroptical sensing methods can streamline this work and allow high&#8208;throughput screening with remarkable reduction of operational time and cost. During the last few years, significant methodological advances with innovative chirality sensing systems, the use of computer&#8208;generated calibration curves, machine learning assistance, and chemometric data processing, to name a few, have emerged and are now matched with commercially available multi&#8208;well plate CD readers. These developments have reframed the chirality sensing space and provide new opportunities that are of interest to a large group of chemists. This review will discuss chirality sensing strategies and applications with representative small&#8208;molecule CD sensors. Emphasis will be given to important milestones and recent advances that accelerate chiral compound analysis by outperforming traditional methods, conquer new directions, and pioneering efforts that lie at the forefront of chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening developments. The goal is to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the current state and a perspective of future directions of this rapidly emerging field.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upcycling and Depolymerization of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As environmental concerns associated with the ultimate fate of polymers grow, researchers are exploring methods to enhance the recycling and sustainability of these ubiquitous materials. Enhanced upcycling, degradation and depolymerization strategies have recently been achieved via photocatalysis and are summarized in this Mini Review.







Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates. Of these material classes, polymethacrylates possess the unique possibility to undergo a photocatalytic depolymerization back to monomer under thermodynamically favourable conditions, thus presenting significant advantages over traditional thermal strategies. Our perspective on current formidable challenges and potential future directions are also discussed.

         <title>Mechanochemical Approaches to Fundamental Studies in Soft&#8208;Matter Physics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promise of polymer mechanochemistry to improve mechanical properties of polymers is widely recognized. This review highlights a complementary, so&#8208;far underexploited, potential of this emerging field to yield quantitative molecular insights into many complex physical problems in soft matter, of both practical and fundamental significance, including fractures of mechanically&#8208;loaded materials and dynamics of macromolecules in rapid flows.







Abstract
Stretching a segment of a polymer beyond its contour length makes its (primarily backbone) bonds more dissociatively labile, which enables polymer mechanochemistry. Integrating some backbone bonds into suitably designed molecular moieties yields mechanistically and kinetically diverse chemistry, which is becoming increasingly exploitable. Examples include, most prominently, attempts to improve mechanical properties of bulk polymers, as well as prospective applications in drug delivery and synthesis. This review aims to highlight an emerging effort to apply the concepts and experimental tools of mechanochemistry to fundamental physical questions in soft matter. A succinct summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;knowledge of the field, with emphasis on foundational concepts and generalizable observations, is followed by analysis of 3 recent examples of mechanochemistry yielding molecular&#8208;level details of elastomer failure, macromolecular chain dynamics in elongational flows and kinetic allostery. We conclude with reasons to assume that the highlighted approaches are generalizable to a broader range of physical problems than considered to date.

         <title>PyrAtes: Modular Organic Salts with Large Stokes Shifts for Fluo&#8208;rescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the discovery of a powerful novel fluorophore class with an imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridinium core, termed PyrAtes. The synthesis was achieved in a single step, demonstrating a wide array of substrates with Stokes shifts as large as 240&#8197;nm, while also reaching NIR&#8722;I emissions at &#955;max up to 720&#8197;nm. These novel fluorophores were successfully applied in live cell imaging in HEK293 cells, suggesting PyrAtes as potent intracellular markers.







Abstract
The deployment of small&#8208;molecule fluorescent agents plays an ever&#8208;growing role in medicine and drug development. Herein, we complement the portfolio of powerful fluorophores, reporting the serendipitous discovery and development of a novel class with an imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridinium triflate core, which we term PyrAtes. These fluorophores are synthesized in a single step from readily available materials (&gt;60&#8197;examples) and display Stokes shifts as large as 240&#8197;nm, while also reaching NIR&#8722;I emissions at &#955;max as long as 720&#8197;nm. Computational studies allow the development of a platform for the prediction of &#955;max and &#955;Em. Furthermore, we demonstrate the compatibility of these novel fluorophores with live cell imaging in HEK293 cells, suggesting PyrAtes as potent intracellular markers.

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: A Direct Conversion of Nms&#8208;Amides to Carboxamides Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept termed &#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;, which we have applied to the coupling of Nms&#8208;protected amines with carboxylic acids. Notably, this approach circumvents the need for a dedicated amine&#8208;deprotection step and obviates the use of additional reagents for carboxylate activation. The reaction was shown to be, in many cases, superior to deprotection followed by functionalization, both in terms of yield and atom economy.







Abstract
The nature of protecting group chemistry necessitates a deprotection step to restore the initially blocked functionality prior to further transformation. As this aspect of protecting group manipulation inevitably adds to the step count of any synthetic sequence, the development of methods enabling simultaneous deprotection and functionalization (&#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;&#8212;distinct from &#8220;deprotection followed by functionalization&#8221;) is appealing, as it has the potential to improve efficiency and streamline synthetic routes. Herein, we report a deprotective functionalization of the newly introduced Nms&#8208;amides guided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, which exploits the inherent Nms reactivity. Mechanistic studies further substantiate and help rationalize the exquisite reactivity of Nms&#8208;amides, as other commonly used protecting groups are shown not to exhibit the same reactivity patterns. The practicality of this approach was ultimately demonstrated in selected case studies.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxygen Activation on Bulk Au(111) Surface Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface is revealed for the first time using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Activation of molecular oxygen on bulk Au(111) surface is found to occur via a water&#8208;promoted mechanism.







Abstract
Gaining mechanistic understanding of oxygen activation on metal surfaces is a topical area of research in surface science. However, direct investigation of on&#8208;surface oxidation processes at the nanoscale and the empirical validation of oxygen activation pathways remain challenging for the conventional analytical tools. In this study, we applied tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to gain mechanistic insights into oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface. Specifically, oxidation of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (4&#8208;ATP) to 4&#8208;nitrothiophenol (4&#8208;NTP) on Au(111) surface was investigated using hyperspectral TERS imaging. Nanoscale TERS images revealed a markedly higher oxidation efficiency in disordered 4&#8208;ATP adlayers compared to the ordered adlayers signifying that the oxidation of 4&#8208;ATP molecules proceeds via interaction with the on&#8208;surface oxidative species. These results were further validated via direct oxidation of the 4&#8208;ATP adlayers with H2O2 solution. Finally, TERS measurements of oxidized 4&#8208;ATP adlayers in the presence of H2O18 provided the first empirical evidence for the generation of oxidative species on bulk Au(111) surface via water&#8208;mediated activation of molecular oxygen. This study expands our mechanistic understanding of oxidation chemistry on bulk Au surface by elucidating the oxygen activation pathway.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Templated Peptide Bond Formation Promotes L&#8208;Homochirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the RNA&#8208;peptide world, non&#8208;canonical nucleotides on complementary RNA strands can be used for RNA&#8208;templated peptide bond formation reactions. Both L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids can be loaded onto a donor RNA strand to give an equimolar mixture of products. The isomeric mixture of donor RNA strands can be coupled with an acceptor RNA strand to form the L,L&#8208;homochiral product in good yield and high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The world in which we live is homochiral. The ribose units that form the backbone of DNA and RNA are all D&#8208;configured and the encoded amino acids that comprise the proteins of all living species feature an all&#8208;L&#8208;configuration at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. The homochirality of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is essential for folding of the peptides into well&#8208;defined and functional 3D structures and the homochirality of D&#8208;ribose is crucial for helix formation and base&#8208;pairing. The question of why nature uses only encoded L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids is not understood. Herein, we show that an RNA&#8208;peptide world, in which peptides grow on RNAs constructed from D&#8208;ribose, leads to the self&#8208;selection of homo&#8208;L&#8208;peptides, which provides a possible explanation for the homo&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and homo&#8208;L&#8208;amino acid combination seen in nature.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Heterocycles via Cycloisomerization of Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208; nucleophiles is reported. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
We report a general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates ethers, esters, protected amines, acetals, pyrazoles, carbamates, and arenes. It is amenable to N&#8208;, O&#8208;, as well as C&#8208;nucleophiles, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversification and synthesis of several small natural products.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphine Boranes via Crystallization&#8208;Induced Dynamic Resolution of Lithiated Intermediate by Understanding the Underlying Epimerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis of chiral phosphine boranes in high e.r.s utilizing the inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA by crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution of its &#945;&#8208;lithiated intermediate. By in&#8208;depth mechanistical studies, the as stereochemically stable known intermediate epimerizes in presence of remaining starting material rendering this method promising for other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Described herein is the successful crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution (CIDR) of an &#945;&#8208;lithiated phosphine borane utilizing the easily accessible and inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA. Starting from the essential P&#8208;prochiral building block dimethyl phenyl phosphine borane we were able to obtain phosphine boranes in yields up to 80&#8201;% and e.r. up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 by crystallization of the lithiated intermediate prior to the trapping reaction. NMR&#8208;based deuterium labeling experiments indicate that the epimerization in solution is based on the intermolecular proton transfer between nonlithiated phosphine borane and the corresponding lithiated intermediate, rendering the presence of the remaining starting compound in an optimized solvent mixture the main factor for successful enantioselective synthesis. Quantum chemical calculations using different model systems based on solid state structures confirm these experimental results. By gaining insights into the epimerization mechanism, essential principles for CIDR of lithiated phosphine boranes are elucidated that may be expanded to other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds and simple chiral amines.

         <title>Radicalizing CO by Mononuclear Palladium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) metalloradical has been isolated and fully characterized. Upon coordination of CO, it confers a significant amount of spin density from the metal to the carbon atom. The carbon centered radical reactivity was investigated towards the homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage of a bulky disulfide.







Abstract
A mononuclear, T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) d9 metalloradical (3), stabilized by a bulky carbazole&#8208;based PNP&#8208;ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8722;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods. The partially reduced and radicalized CO slowly reacts with di(tert&#8208;butyl) disulfide under homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage and C&#8722;S bond formation to give the corresponding metallathioester.

         <title>Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock: A Rebuilding&#8208;free Electrochemical Chip with a Customizable Decoding Probe for Real&#8208;Time and Portable Pathogen Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) and a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use multichannel instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T) for portable isothermal amplification detection. Our method provides high sensitivity &amp; selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background, one&#8208;pot operation and real&#8208;time signal collection.







Abstract
In order to realize portable pathogen diagnostics with easier quantitation, digitization and integration, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) for real&#8208;time detection of isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Bridged by a branched DNA as codelock, the isothermal amplicon is transduced into increased current of an electrochemical probe, holding multiple advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background and one&#8208;pot operation. Through a self&#8208;designed portable instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T), the detection can be implemented on a multichannel microchip and output real&#8208;time amplification curves just like an expensive commercial PCR machine. The microchip is a rebuilding&#8208;free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, African swine fever, FluA and FluB) genes as targets, and two branch (3&#8208;way and 4&#8208;way) DNAs as codelock probes.

The microchip is a rebuilding-free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS-CoV-2, African swine fever, FluA and FluB) genes as targets, and two branch (3-way and 4-way) DNAs as codelock probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elastic Relaxor Ferroelectric by Thiol&#8208;ene Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor ferroelectrics possess unique advantages, such as high electric&#8208;mechanical responsiveness and high sensitivity to changes in electric fields, which can be potentially employed as the energy storage and actuation in wearable electronics. Herein, we propose a novel approach utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click reaction to develop elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, which is under a mild condition and a compatible procedure with photolithography.







Abstract
As ferroelectrics hold significance and application prospects in wearable devices, the elastification of ferroelectrics becomes more and more important. Nevertheless, achieving elastic ferroelectrics requires stringent synthesis conditions, while the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric materials remains unexplored, presenting an untapped potential for utilization in energy storage and actuation for wearable electronics. The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction offers a mild and rapid reaction platform to prepare functional polymers. Therefore, we employed this approach to obtain an elastic relaxor ferroelectric by crosslinking an intramolecular carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds (CF=CH) polymer matrix with multiple thiol groups via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The resulting elastic relaxor ferroelectric demonstrates pronounced relaxor&#8208;type ferroelectric behaviour. This material exhibits low modulus, excellent resilience, and fatigue resistance, maintaining a stable ferroelectric response even under strains up to 70&#8201;%. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient approach for the construction of elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, thereby expanding the application possibilities in wearable electronics.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation of a Chiral Hybrid Lead Halide Resonant to Charge Transfer Exciton from Metal Halide Octahedra to Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal octahedra to ligand charge transfer excitons of chiral metal halides have been demonstrated to serve as a new resonant channel with an appropriate resonant energy level to boost second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Ultimately, these single crystals exhibit remarkably resonant enhanced SHG signals, of one order of magnitude higher than that of urea and two orders of magnitude higher than that of KDP.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) offer an ideal platform for the advancement of second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their inherent noncentrosymmetric structures. The enhancement of optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs could be achieved by matching the free exciton and/or self&#8208;trapped exciton energy levels with desired NLO frequencies. However, the current scarcity of resonance modes and low resonance ratio hamper the further improvements of NLO performance. Herein, we propose a new resonant channel of charge transfer (CT) excited states from metal halide polyhedra to organic ligand to boost the second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs. The model lead halide (C7H10N)PbBr3 (C7H10N=1&#8208;ethylpyridinium) exhibits a drastically enhanced second harmonic generation in resonance to the deep CT exciton energy, with intensity of up to 111.0 times that of KDP and 10.9 times that of urea. The effective NLO coefficient has been determined to be as high as ~40.2&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, balanced with a large polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold. This work highlights the contribution of organic ligands in the construction of a resonant channel for enhancing second&#8208;order NLO coefficients of metal halides, and thus provides guidelines for designing new chiral HOMHs materials for advanced nonlinear photonic applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient directing group free C&#8722;H arylation of anisoles via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a wide variety of anisole derivatives and aryl iodides and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage arylation of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize biaryl compounds without the need of the prefuctionalization of starting materials, or the installment and removal of directing groups on the substrate. A direct C&#8722;H arylation of simple arenes as limiting reactants remains a challenge. Here we disclose a non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation of anisole derivatives as limiting reagents with aryl iodides under mild reaction conditions. The arylated products are obtained in synthetically useful yields and the arylation of bioactive molecules is also demonstrated. Key to the success of this methodology is the use of a one&#8208;step synthesized S,O&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dragocins A&#8722;C through Electrochemical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical cyclization is leveraged to forge the central 9&#8208;membered ring in the hybrid metabolites dragocins A&#8722;C. The route features several stereocontrolled reactions to address the stereotetrad of the pyrrolidine fragment and a penultimate decarboxylative chlorination and global deprotection to furnish both dragocins B and C. Dragocin A was prepared through simple methanolysis of dragocin C.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of dragocins A&#8722;C, remarkable natural products containing an unusual C4&#8217; oxidized ribose architecture bridged by a polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine, is presented through a route featuring a number of uncommon maneuvers. Several generations towards the target molecules are presented, including the spectacular failure of a key C&#8722;H oxidation on a late&#8208;stage intermediate. The final route features rapid, stereocontrolled access to a densely functionalized pyrrolidine and an unprecedented diastereoselective oxidative electrochemical cyclization to forge the hallmark 9&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary studies suggest this electrochemical oxidation protocol is generally useful.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: On the Detection and Stability of the Initial Carbonyloxy Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical decarboxylation reaction pathway and spectral calculations of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyloxy radicals demonstrate that they have distinct electronic absorption properties and that the former are much more unstable. These findings pertain to a controversy on the mechanism of the photoenzyme fatty acid photodecarboxylase. They support the here reinforced experimental observation of intrinsic CO2 dissociation in &#8810;300&#8197;ps.







Abstract
In fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), light&#8208;induced formation of the primary radical product RCOO&#8901; from fatty acid RCOO&#8722; occurs in 300&#8197;ps, upon which CO2 is released quasi&#8208;immediately. Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO&#8901; (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB&#8901;), much longer&#8208;lived linear RCOO&#8901; has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB&#8901; decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB&#8901;, aliphatic RCOO&#8901; radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, &#8810;300&#8197;ps RCOO&#8901; decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.

     alt="Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: On the Detection and Stability of the Initial Carbonyloxy Radical Intermediate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum chemical decarboxylation reaction pathway and spectral calculations of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyloxy radicals demonstrate that &lt;b&gt;they have distinct electronic absorption properties and that the former are much more unstable&lt;/b&gt;. These findings pertain to a controversy on the mechanism of the photoenzyme fatty acid photodecarboxylase. They support the here reinforced experimental observation of intrinsic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation in &#8810;300&#8197;ps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), light-induced formation of the primary radical product RCOO&#8901; from fatty acid RCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; occurs in 300&#8197;ps, upon which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released quasi-immediately. Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO&#8901; (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB&#8901;), much longer-lived linear RCOO&#8901; has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB&#8901; decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB&#8901;, aliphatic RCOO&#8901; radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time-resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, &#8810;300&#8197;ps RCOO&#8901; decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Chain Reptation Enhances Energy Dissipation of Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy dissipation of elastomers is precisely enhanced by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass.







Abstract
Vibrations with various frequencies in daily life and industry can cause health hazards and fatigue failure of critical structures, which requires the development of elastomers with high energy dissipation at desired frequencies. Current strategies relying on tuning characteristic relaxation time of polymer chains are mostly qualitative empirical methods, and it is difficult to precisely control damping performances. Here, we report a general strategy for constructing dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels that provide controllable ultrahigh energy dissipation. This is realized by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation of polymer fluids in a crosslinked network, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass. Using prototypical supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, we demonstrate that dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh damping performance at desired frequencies (10&#8722;2~102&#8197;Hz), exceeding that of typical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicone damping materials. Their shock absorption is over 300&#8201;% higher than that of commercial silicone rubber under the same impact force.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Highly Oxygenated (Furano)germacranolides Derived from Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective synthesis of six (furano)germacranolides derived from Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus was achieved. The assembly of the highly oxygenated ten&#8208;membered ring of molephantin and tomenphantopin F was enabled by diastereoselective Barbier allylation coupled with Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi macrocyclization. The photoinduced cycloisomerization of molephantin enabled access to four furanogermacranolides, such as tomenphantopin C.







Abstract
Germacranolides, secondary metabolites produced by plants, have garnered academic and industrial interest due to their diverse and complex topology as well as a wide array of pharmacological activities. Molephantin, a highly oxygenated germacranolide isolated from medicinal plants, Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus, has exhibited antitumor, inflammatory, and leishmanicidal activities. Its chemical structure is based on a highly strained ten&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone with an (E,Z)&#8208;dienone moiety, which is fused with an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and adorned with four successive stereogenic centers. Herein, we report the first synthesis of molephantin in 12 steps starting from readily available building blocks. The synthesis features the highly diastereoselective intermolecular Barbier allylation of the &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde with optically active 3&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;5H&#8208;furan&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate and ensuing Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) macrocyclization for the construction of the highly oxygenated ten&#8208;membered macrocyclic framework. This synthetic route enabled access to another germacranolide congener, tomenphantopin F. Furthermore, cycloisomerization of molephantin into 2&#8208;deethoxy&#8208;2&#946;&#8208;hydroxyphantomolin could be facilitated by irradiation with ultraviolet A light (&#955;max=370&#8197;nm), which opened a versatile and concise access to the related furanogermacranolides such as EM&#8208;2, phantomolin, 2&#8208;O&#8208;demethyltomenphantopin C, and tomenphantopin C.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Primary Chlorides by Selective Chlorocarbonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical strategy for rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides by regioselective chlorocarbonylation of alkenes was developed using dual Ni/photoredox catalysis. The transformation features broad functional group tolerance and operational simplicity. Preliminary control experiments and DFT mechanistic studies suggest the photocatalytic generation of Cl&#8901; and subsequent addition to the alkene followed by nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Functionalized primary alkyl chlorides are precursors to a plethora of scaffolds but their access from chemical feedstocks remains challenging. Herein, we report a concise dual Ni/photoredox catalytic protocol for regioselective chlorocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes that enables rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides. The catalytic process features an extensive substrate scope, scalability and functional group tolerance. The Ni/photocatalytic Cl&#8901; generation and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling is implicated for the process based on the control experiments and DFT study. The synthetic utility of the protocol has been further corroborated through functionalization of complex substrates and modifications of the product.

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dehydroalanine&#8208;Derived Peptides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic hydroarylation of dehydroalanine (Dha) and Dha&#8208;containing peptides with versatile arylthianthrenium salts was developed in batch and in flow, enabling expedient scale&#8208;up. The mild nature of the photocatalytic approach allowed the diversification of peptides featuring various sensitive functional groups and the effective stitching of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a myriad of arenes and drug scaffolds.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis by the late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. Herein, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale&#8208;up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.

         <title>Selective Peptide Cysteine Manipulation on Demand and Difficult Protein Chemical Synthesis Enabled by Controllable Acidolysis of N,S&#8208;Benzylidene Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;containing substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals exhibit controllable acidolysis kinetics, which can be applied to selective peptide modification and protein chemical synthesis. Detailed kinetic studies, various examples of peptide modification and the first chemical synthesis of the native PD&#8208;L1 IgV domain were included in this study.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis combining with chemical ligation provides a way to build up customized polypeptides in general, many targets are still presenting challenges for the conventional synthetic process, such as hydrophobic proteins. New methods and strategies are still required to overcome these obstacles. In this study, kinetic studies of Cys/Pen ligation and its acidolysis were performed, from which the fast acidolysis of substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals (NBTs) was discovered. The study demonstrates the potential of NBTs as a promising Cys switchable protection, facilitating the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins by efficiently disrupting peptide aggregation. The compatibility of NBTs with other commonly adopted Cys protecting groups and their applications in sequential disulfide bond formation were also investigated. The first chemical synthesis of the native human programmed death ligand 1 immunoglobulin V&#8208;like (PD&#8208;L1 IgV) domain was achieved using the NBT strategy, showcasing its potential in difficult protein synthesis.

         <title>A Universal Self&#8208;Propagating Synthesis of Aluminum&#8208;Based Oxyhalide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, the current method of SSE preparation usually involves high&#8208;energy mechanical ball milling and/or a high&#8208;temperature annealing process, which is not suitable for practical application. Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+). It is elucidated that the amorphous matrix, which mainly consists of various oxidized chloroaluminate species that provide numerous sites for smooth ion migration, is actually the key factor for the achieved high conductivities. The application of these aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs synthesized by our approach further pushes forward their practical application considering their easy synthesis, low cost, and low weight that ensures high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>New Alkalescent Electrolyte Chemistry for Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3 mol L&#8208;1 OH&#8208;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide (normally only 0.4 mol L&#8208;1 at 25 oC) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH 12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide ion&#8208;solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide to 1.7 mol L&#8208;1 and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74 Wh L&#8208;1 at 60 oC and remains stable for 1800 cycles (1800 hours) at 0 oC and for &gt;1400 cycles (2300 hours) at 25 oC. An alkalescent zinc&#8208;ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608 W of power for ~40 days.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cyclized Polyacrylonitrile as an Electron Selective Layer for n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cell with Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed to replace n&#8208;type metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2 or SnO2) as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The CPAN layer is fabricated via facile in&#8208;situ cyclization reaction of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coated on a conducting glass substrate. The CPAN layer is robust and insoluble in common solvents, and possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13 x 10&#8208;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. With the CPAN as an ESL, the PSC affords a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.12%, which is the highest for the n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with organic ESLs. Moreover, the device with the CPAN layer holds superior operational stability, maintaining over 90% of their initial efficiency after 500 h continuous light soaking. These results confirm that the CPAN layer would be a desirable low&#8208;cost and efficient ESL for n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs and other photoelectronic devices with high performance and stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The dense and ordered molecular arrangements endow dynamic molecular crystals with fast response, rapid energy conversion, low energy dissipation, and strong coupling between heat/light and mechanical energy. Most of the known dynamic crystals can only respond to a single stimulus, and materials that can respond to multiple stimuli are rare. Here, we report an organic crystalline material that can be bent plastically and is also thermosalient, as its crystals can move when they undergo a reversible phase transition. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. The combination of light transduction and reversible thermomechanical deformation provides an opportunity to switch the waveguiding capability of the material in a narrow temperature range, which holds a tremendous potential for applications in heat&#8208;averse electronic components, such as central processing units. Unlike existing electronics, the material we report here is completely organic and therefore much lighter, potentially reducing the overall weight of electronic circuits.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic modulators for plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3s are promising chemical tools both for understanding the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and controlling plant physiology. Here, we describe a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins ofArabidopsis&#160;thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from&#160;unexpected products&#160;in DMSO stock solution of an in&#8208;house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant&#8208;based analyses,&#160;fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assaysrevealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to&#160;Arabidopsis&#160;leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor&#160;should provide a new insight into the design of potent and isoform&#8208;selective 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 modulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Charge Transfer Cocrystals with Dynamically Reversible Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Display Chain Length&#8208;Selective Vapochromism to Alkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting plays an essential role in controlling the biofunction of biosystems, such as the chiral double&#8208;helix structure of DNA from self&#8208;recognition by hydrogen bonding. However, achieving precise control over the chiral self&#8208;sorted structures and their functional properties for the bioinspired supramolecular systems still remains a challenge, not to mention realizing dynamically reversible regulation. Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor&#8208;induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid&#8208;state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self&#8208;sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self&#8208;sorting at the solid&#8208;vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8211;H (N&#8208;Phenyltetrazole)thiolation as an Enabling Tool for Molecular Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods enabling the broad diversification of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds from a common intermediate are especially valuable in chemical synthesis. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds using a commercially available disulfide to access N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers. The thioether products are readily elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8211;C, C&#8211;O, or C&#8211;N construction. The C&#8211;H functionalization proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving hydrogen atom transfer by the electron&#8208;poor N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical. Hexafluoroisopropanol was found to be essential to reactions involving aliphatic C(sp3)&#8211;H thiolation, with computational analysis consistent with dual hydrogen bonding of the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical imparting increased radical electrophilicity to facilitate the hydrogen atom transfer. Substrate is limiting reagent in all cases, and the reaction displays an exceptional functional group tolerance well suited to applications in late&#8208;stage diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Record High Iodate Anion Capture by a Redox&#8208;Active Cationic Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a critical radioactive anionic contaminant, traditional adsorbents primarily remove iodate (IO3&#8208;) through ion exchange or hard acid&#8208;hard base interactions, but suffer from limited affinity and capacity. Herein, employing the synergistic effect of ion exchange and redox, we successfully synthesized a redox&#8208;active cationic polymer network (SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6, [C9H10O2N5&#8226;Cl]n) by merging guanidino groups with ion&#8208;exchange capability and phenolic groups with redox ability via a Schiff base reaction. SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 exhibits a groundbreaking adsorption capacity of 896 mg/g for IO3&#8208;. The inferior adsorption capacities of polymeric networks containing only redox (~0 mg/g) or ion exchange (232 mg/g) fragments underscore the synergistic &#8220;1 + 1 &gt; 2&#8221; effect of the two mechanisms. Besides, SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 shows excellent uptake selectivity for IO3&#8208; in the presence of high concentrations of SO42&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, and NO3&#8208;. Meanwhile, a high distribution coefficient indicates its exemplary deep&#8208;removal performance for low IO3&#8208; concentration. The synergic strategy not only presents a breakthrough solution for the efficient removal of IO3&#8208; but also establishes a promising avenue for the design of advanced adsorbents for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Phenol Derivatives over Bismuth&#8208;Based Porous Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous bismuth&#8208;based metal halide perovskites with tunable band gap compositions are prepared and explored as photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O coupling reactions. The porous morphology, appropriate band&#8208;edge alignment and Lewis acid sites of CsBi2Br9 are found to play a crucial role in stabilizing the phenolic intermediates, thereby boosting the reaction kinetics.







Abstract
The selective oxidative coupling of phenol derivatives, involving carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond formation, has emerged as a critical approach in the synthesis of natural products. However, achieving precise control over the selectivity in coupling reactions of unsubstituted phenols utilizing solar light as the driving force remains a big challenge. In this study, we report a series of porous Cs3Bi2X9 (X=Cl, Br, I) photocatalysts with tailored band gaps and compositions engineered for efficient solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol coupling. Notably, p&#8208;Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited about 73&#8201;% selectivity for C&#8722;C coupling, displaying a high formation rate of 47.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under solar radiation. Furthermore, this approach enables control of the site&#8208;selectivity for phenol derivatives on Cs3Bi2X9, enhancing C&#8722;C coupling. The distinctive porous structure and appropriate band&#8208;edge positions of Cs3Bi2Br9 facilitated efficient charge separation, and surface interaction/activation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, resulting in the kinetically preferred formation of C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bond. Mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway, supported by comprehensive control experiments, unveiled the crucial role of interfacial charge transfers and Lewis acid Bi sites in stabilizing phenolic intermediates, thereby directing the regioselectivity of diradical couplings and resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical biphenols.

         <title>Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding Networks Stabilized Organic Supramolecular Cathode for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity and Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic cathode BQQPH with multiple active sites is developed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable Al batteries. The six C=O and six C=N groups in BQQPH enables a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions within BQQPH enable robust structural stability and minimal solubility, yielding an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage, attributing to the abundant reserves, low cost, intrinsic safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, the cathode materials reported thus far still face challenges such as limited capacity, sluggish kinetics, and undesirable cycle life. Herein, we propose an organic cathode benzo[i] benzo[6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a] benzo [6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;5,8,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaone (BQQPH) for RABs. The six C=O and six C=N redox active sites in each molecule enable BQQPH to deliver a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Encouragingly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions endow BQQPH with robust structural stability and minimal solubility, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group induces a reduction in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which considerably enhances both the discharge voltage and redox kinetics of BQQPH. In situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations unveil that the charge storage mechanism is reversible coordination/dissociation of AlCl2+ with the N and O sites in BQQPH accompanied by 12&#8208;electron transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials for RABs.

         <title>A Photodynamic and Photochemotherapeutic Platinum&#8208;Iridium Charge&#8208;Transfer Conjugate for Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer between donor Ir(III) and acceptor Pt(IV) introduces synergistic activity for these photodynamic and phototherapeutic centres, 1O2 and radical generation, higher Pt accumulation, and damages cell nuclei and releases chromosomes. X&#8208;ray fluorescence revealed a broad distribution in cells, with Ir localised in small compartments, some as a cleaved fragment.







Abstract
The novel hetero&#8208;dinuclear complex trans,trans,trans&#8208;[PtIV(py)2(N3)2(OH)(&#956;&#8208;OOCCH2CH2CONHCH2&#8208;bpyMe)IrIII(ppy)2]Cl (Pt&#8208;Ir), exhibits charge transfer between the acceptor photochemotherapeutic Pt(IV) (Pt&#8208;OH) and donor photodynamic Ir(III) (Ir&#8208;NH2) fragments. It is stable in the dark, but undergoes photodecomposition more rapidly than the Pt(IV) parent complex (Pt&#8208;OH) to generate Pt(II) species, an azidyl radical and 1O2. The Ir(III)* excited state, formed after irradiation, can oxidise NADH to NAD&#8901; radicals and NAD+. Pt&#8208;Ir is highly photocytotoxic towards cancer cells with a high photocytotoxicity index upon irradiation with blue light (465&#8197;nm, 4.8&#8197;mW/cm2), even with short light&#8208;exposure times (10&#8211;60&#8197;min). In contrast, the mononuclear Pt&#8208;OH and Ir&#8208;NH2 subunits and their simple mixture are much less potent. Cellular Pt accumulation was higher for Pt&#8208;Ir compared to Pt&#8208;OH. Irradiation of Pt&#8208;Ir in cancer cells damages nuclei and releases chromosomes. Synchrotron&#8208;XRF revealed ca. 4&#215; higher levels of intracellular platinum compared to iridium in Pt&#8208;Ir treated cells under dark conditions. Luminescent Pt&#8208;Ir distributes over the whole cell and generates ROS and 1O2 within 1&#8197;h of irradiation. Iridium localises strongly in small compartments, suggestive of complex cleavage and excretion via recycling vesicles (e.g. lysosomes). The combination of PDT and PACT motifs in one molecule, provides Pt&#8208;Ir with a novel strategy for multimodal phototherapy.

         <title>Redox Molecular Junction Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;assisted CO2 Energy Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A kind of redox molecular junction sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework with multiple active sites have been prepared and can be successfully applied for light&#8208;assisted CO2 energy storage.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light sensitive and bi&#8208;functionally favored CO2 reduction (CRR)/evolution (CER) photocathode catalysts that can get rid of the utilization of ultraviolet light and improve sluggish kinetics is demanded to conquer the current technique&#8208;barrier of traditional Li&#8208;CO2 battery. Here, a kind of redox molecular junction sp2c metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BTDE&#8208;COF) has been prepared through the connection between Cu3 and BTDE and can serve as efficient photocathode catalyst in light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2 battery. Cu3&#8208;BTDE&#8208;COF with redox&#8208;ability, visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, electron&#8208;hole separation ability and endows the photocathode with excellent round&#8208;trip efficiency (95.2&#8201;%) and an ultralow voltage hysteresis (0.18&#8197;V), outperforming the Schiff base COFs (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BTDA&#8208;COF and Cu3&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) and majority of the reported photocathode catalysts. Combined theoretical calculations with characterizations, Cu3&#8208;BTDE&#8208;COF with the integration of Cu3 centers, thiazole and cyano groups possess strong CO2 adsorption/activation and Li+ interaction/diffusion ability to boost the CRR/CER kinetics and related battery property.

         <title>Including the Ensemble of Unstructured Conformations in the Analysis of Protein's Native State by High&#8208;Pressure NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift of proteins allows statements on structural fluctuations proteins exhibit at ambient pressure. The inherent issue of separating general pressure effects from structural related effects on the pressure dependence of chemical shifts has so far been addressed by considering the characteristics of random coil peptides on increasing pressure. In this work, chemically and pressure denatured states of the cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) have been assigned in 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC NMR spectra and their dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure has been evaluated. The pressure denatured polypeptide chain has been used to separate general from structural related effects on 1H and 15N chemical shifts of native BsCspB and the implications on the interpretation of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift regarding the structure of BsCspB are discussed. It has been found that the ensemble of unstructured conformations of BsCspB shows different responses to increasing pressure than random coil peptides do. Thus, the approach used for considering the general effects that arise when hydrostatic pressure increases changes the structural conclusions that are drawn from high pressure NMR spectroscopic experiments that rely on the analysis of chemical shifts.</dc:description>

An equilibrium exists between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts, where the anti&#8208;selectivity is determined by the larger barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct.







Abstract
The stereodefined and highly substituted vinylsilanes are essential building blocks for constructing complex organic molecules. Transition metal&#8208;mediated silylmetalation of alkynes was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations; however, a very limited study was carried out to utilize transient vinylmetal species in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, they produce syn&#8208;adduct, and the anti&#8208;selective cross&#8208;coupling is still unknown and highly desired. Silylzinc reagents are highly functional group tolerant, however, their synthesis from pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts hampers cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Our novel solid silylzinc reagents circumvent these constraints are employed in the anti&#8208;selective synthesis of vinylsilanes via a multi&#8208;component reaction involving Me3SiZnI, terminal alkynes, and activated alkyl halides. An intensive computational and experimental investigation of the mechanism reveals an equilibrium between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts; the greater barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct determine the anti&#8208;selectivity.

Transition metal-mediated silylmetalation of alkynes was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations; however, a very limited study was carried out to utilize transient vinylmetal species in cross-coupling reactions. Moreover, they produce syn-adduct, and the anti-selective cross-coupling is still unknown and highly desired.

         <title>On the Dendrite&#8208;Suppressing Effect of Laser&#8208;Processed Polylactic Acid&#8208;Derived Carbon Coated Zinc Anode in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid performance and device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation. One possible solution to tackle this problem and to extend the cycling life of AZIBs is to modify the zinc anode surface by coating carbonaceous materials, enabling controlled charge flux and uniform ion distribution. This work reports a sustainable and bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) as a coating layer on the zinc anode. Carbonizing this polymer under ambient conditions using a high&#8208;power nanosecond laser forms a carbon&#8208;coated zinc foil, which was directly utilized as the anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The fabricated laser&#8208;processed PLA&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;coated zinc anode demonstrated an extended cycling life of almost 1600 hours, significantly outperforming the bare zinc anode. A full aqueous zinc ion battery assembled from as&#8208;modified anode and as&#8208;prepared V2O5 nanofibers as cathode was able to deliver a specific capacity of 238 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 with a capacity retention of 70 % after 1000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled Aryl Trifluoromethyl Sulfones, &#8208;Sulfoxides, and &#8208;Sulfides for&#160;Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positron emission tomography (PET) is becoming increasingly important in nuclear medicine and drug discovery. To date, the development of many potential PET tracers is hampered by the lack of suitable synthetic pathways for their preparation. This is particularly true for the highly desired radiolabeling of compounds bearing [18F]CF3&#8208;groups. For instance, S(O)nCF3&#8208;groups (n = 0, 1, 2) serve as structural motif in a range of biologically active compounds, but their radiosynthesis remains largely unprecedented (for n = 1, 2). Herein, we describe general methods for the radiosynthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8211;sulfides. All three methods are operationally straightforward, start from widely available precursors, i.e., sulfonyl fluorides and thiophenols, and make use of the recently established [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent. Further, the syntheses display good functional group tolerance as demonstrated by the 18F&#8208;labeling of more than 40 compounds. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated by the radiolabeling of three bioactive molecules, optionally to be used as PET tracers. In a broader context, this work presents a substantial expansion of the chemical space of radiofluorinated structural motifs to be used for the development of new PET tracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperbranched Vitrimer for Ultrahigh Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers are ideally utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effective suppression of vibrations and noises in various fields. Current strategies rely on broadening the glass transition region or introducing additional relaxation components to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of polymeric damping materials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve high damping efficiency through structural control while maintaining dynamic characteristics. &#160;In this work, we propose a new strategy to develop hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks. A novel yet weak dynamic transesterification between the carboxyl and boronic acid ester was confirmed and used to prepare HBVs based on poly (hexyl methacrylate&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;ethenylphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborinane) P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) copolymers. The ABn&#8208;type of macromonomers, the crosslinking points formed by the dynamic covalent connection via the associative exchange, and the weak yet dynamic exchange reaction are the three keys to developing high&#8208;performance HBV damping materials. We found that P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) 20k&#8208;40&#8208;60 HBV exhibited ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency and temperature range, attributed to the synergistic effect of dense pendant chains and weak dynamic covalent crosslinks. This unique design concept will provide a general approach to developing advanced damping materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bithiophene&#8208;Functionalized Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Metal Complexes as Single&#8208;Molecule Platforms for Synergistic Photodynamic, Photothermal, and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A planar conjugated ligand functionalized with bithiophene and its Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) complexes have been constructed as single&#8208;molecule platform for synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy. The complexes have significant two&#8208;photon absorption at 808 nm and remarkable singlet oxygen and superoxide anion production in aqueous solution and cells when exposed to 808 nm infrared irradiation. The most potent Ru(II) complex Ru7 enters tumor cells via the rare macropinocytosis, locates in both nuclei and mitochondria, and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly including DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibition and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy in vivo for malignant melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer tumors, with a 100% survival rate of mice, low toxicity to normal cells and low residual rate. Such an infrared two&#8208;photon activatable metal complex may contribute to a new generation of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform to address drug resistance in clinical practice and phototherapy for large, deeply located solid tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Frameworks Based on Multiple Dynamic Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of crystalline porous materials has been developed utilizing multilevel dynamic linkages, including covalent B&#8208;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Typically, boronic acids undergo in situ condensation to afford B3O3&#8208;based units, which further extend to molecular complexes or chains via B&#8592;N bonds. The obtained superstructures are subsequently interconnected via hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, producing crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs). The CPOFs display excellent solution processability, allowing dissolution and subsequent crystallization to their original structures, independent of recrystallization conditions, possibly due to the diverse bond energies of the involved interactions. Significantly, the CPOFs can be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale using cost&#8208;effective monomers. In addition, the numerous acidic sites endow the CPOFs with high NH3 capacity, surpassing most porous organic materials and commercial materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Repurposing enzymes to catalyze non&#8208;natural asymmetric transformations that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods is of significant importance. Although radical C&#8208;O bond formation has emerged as a powerful approach for constructing oxygen&#8208;containing compounds, controlling the stereochemistry poses a great challenge. Here we present the development of a dual bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;catalytic system comprising an ene&#8208;reductase and an organic dye for achieving stereoselective lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8208;O formations (one C&#8208;O bond for hydrolactonizations and lactonization&#8208;alkylations while two C&#8208;O bonds for lactonization&#8208;oxygenations). This dual catalysis gave a new approach to a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter (up to 99% enantiomeric excess, up to 12.9:1 diastereomeric ratio). Detailed mechanistic studies, including computational simulations, uncovered the synergistic effect of the enzyme and the externally added organophotoredox catalyst Rh6G.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Olefin&#8208;Linked Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity is highly desirable while remains great challenge due to the poor reversibility of the formation reaction for the olefin linkages during the in situ structural self&#8208;healing process. Herein, we successfully synthesized two sets of enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked COFs. The chiral catalytic groups are uniformly distributed on the pore walls of COFs, resulting in the full exposure of catalytic sites to the reactants in asymmetric catalysis. The as&#8208;prepared (R)/(S)&#8208;CCOF8 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with exceeding 99% enantiomeric excess in the enantioselective electrophilic amination reaction. Moreover, the heterogeneous chiral catalysts are conveniently recycled and could maintain the performance after ten catalytic cycles. Our findings expand the scope to construct stable and crystalline chiral COFs for the asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Glycopeptides in Living Cells Resembling Viral Infection for Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly in living cells represents one versatile strategy for drug delivery; however, it suffers from the limited precision and efficiency. Inspired by viral traits, we here report a cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation (THT) assembly of glycosylated peptides in living cells holistically resembling viral infection for efficient cargo delivery and combined tumor therapy. We design a glycosylated peptide via incorporating a &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;serine residue into bola&#8208;amphiphilic sequences. Co&#8208;assembling of the glycosylated peptide with two counterparts containing irinotecan (IRI) or ligand TSFAEYWNLLSP (PMI) results in formation of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies SgVEIP, which target cancer cells via &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and undergo galactosidase&#8208;induced morphological transformation. While GSH&#8208;reduction causes release of IRI from the co&#8208;assemblies, the PMI moieties release p53 and facilitate cell death via binding with protein MDM2. Cellular experiments show membrane targeting, endo&#8208;/lysosome&#8208;mediated internalization and in situ formation of nanofibers in cytoplasm by SgVEIP. This cascade THT process enables efficient delivery of IRI and PMI into cancer cells secreting Gal&#8208;1 and overexpressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. In vivo studies illustrate enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate an in situ assembly strategy mimicking viral infection, thus providing a new route for drug delivery and cancer therapy in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrative Chemical Recycling Approach for Catalytic Oxidation of Epoxy Resin and in&#8208;situ Separation of Degraded Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in&#8208;situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on FeIV=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl2 with reaction reagents. As the FeIV=O radicals attacked the C&#8208;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the FeIV=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high&#8208;value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Co16&#8208;N3&#8208;based UiO&#8208;MOF to Expand Design Parameters for MOF Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of secondary building units (SBUs) in versatile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a promising method for developing multi&#8208;functional materials, especially for improving their sensitizing ability. Herein, we developed a dual small molecules auxiliary strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC with visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing capacity. Remarkably, the N3&#8208; molecule in hexadecameric cobalt azide SBU offers novel modification sites to precise bonding of strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction. The resulting Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC exhibits extremely high performance for oxidative coupling benzylamine (~100% yield) via both energy and electron transfer processes, which is much superior to that of Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (31.5%) and Carboxyl Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (37.5%). Systematic investigations reveal that the advantages of Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC in dual light&#8208;absorbing channels, robust bonding between Bodipy/Co16 clusters and efficient electron&#8208;hole separation can greatly boost photosynthesis. This work provides an ideal molecular platform for synergy between photosensitizing MOFs and chromophores by constructing high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based SBUs with surface&#8208;modifiable small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Crown Ether Electrolyte Induced Li2O2 Amorphization for Low Polarization and Long Lifespan Li&#8208;O2 batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries possess an extremely high theoretical energy density, rendering them a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation secondary batteries. However, they still face multiple problems such as huge charge polarization and poor cycle life, which lay a significant gap between laboratory research and commercial applications. In this work, we adapt 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether (C15) as solvent to regulate the generation of discharge products in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. The coronal structure endows C15 with strong affinity to Li+, firmly stabilizes the intermediate LiO2 and discharge product Li2O2. Thus, the crystalline Li2O2 is amorphized into easily decomposable amorphous products. The lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries assembled with 0.5 M C15 electrolyte show an increased discharge capacity from 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 to 5.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a low charge overpotential of 0.88 V during the whole lifespan at 0.05 mA cm&#8722;2. The batteries with 1 M C15 electrolyte can cycle stably for 140 cycles. Furthermore, the amorphous characteristic of Li2O2 product is preserved when matched with redox mediators such as LiI, with the charge polarization further decreasing to 0.74 V over a cycle life of 190 cycles. This provides new possibilities for electrolyte design to promote Li2O2 amorphization and reduce charge overpotential in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure [6]&#8208;Azairidahelicene by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of a Configurationally Labile [4]&#8208;Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand (4&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;benzo[g]phenanthrene, L1H) using bis&#8208;cyclometalated chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |gphos| values of 1.8&#215;10&#8211;3.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Multidimensional Functional Materials from Sequence&#8208;defined Peptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly represents a powerful strategy for the fabrication of functional materials across various length scales. However, achieving precise formation of functional hierarchical assemblies remains a significant challenge and requires a profound understanding of molecular assembly interactions. In this study, we present a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the hierarchical assembly of sequence&#8208;defined peptoids into multidimensional functional materials, including twisted nanotube bundles serving as a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and analyzing single crystal structures of model compounds, we elucidated the molecular packing and mechanisms underlying the assembly of peptoids into multidimensional nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating aromatic functional groups, such as tetraphenyl ethylene (TPE), at the termini of assembling peptoid sequences promotes the formation of twisted bundles of nanotubes and nanosheets, thus enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. This research exemplifies the potential of leveraging sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers to translate microscopic molecular structures into macroscopic assemblies. It holds promise for the development of functional materials with precisely controlled hierarchical structures and designed functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Paper Spray Mass Spectrometry with On&#8208;Paper Electrokinetic Manipulations: Part&#8208; Per&#8208;Trillion Detection of Per/Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Water and Opioids in Urine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a simple, paper&#8208;based device that enables sensitive detection by mass spectrometry (MS) without solid phase extraction or other sample preparation.&#160; Using glass fiber filter papers within a 3D printed holder, the device employs electrokinetic manipulations to stack, separate, and desalt charged molecules on paper prior to spray into the MS. Due to counter&#8208;balanced electroosmotic flow and electrophoresis, charged analytes stack on the paper and desalting occurs in minutes.&#160; One end of the paper strip was cut into a sharp point and positioned near the inlet of a MS.&#160; The stacked analyte bands move toward the paper tip with the EOF where they are ionized by paper spray.&#160; The device was applied to analysis of PFAS in tap water with sub part&#8208;per&#8208;trillion detection limits in less than ten minutes with no sample pretreatment. Analysis of opioids in urine also occurs in minutes. The crucial parameters to enable stacking, separation, and MS ionization of both positively and negatively charged analytes were determined and optimized. Experimental and computational modeling studies confirm the electrokinetic stacking and analyte transport mechanisms. On&#8208;paper separations were carried out by stacking analyte bands at different locations depending on their electrophoretic mobility, achieving baseline separation in some cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Silylenes with a small chalcogenide substituent: Tuning frontier orbital energies from O to Te</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (dtbpCbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(dtbpCbz)SiE16R] (E16R = OtBu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or tert&#8208;butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide&#8208;substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN3 (Ter = 2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl).</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermally Responsive Crystallization&#8208;Driven Template Autocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autocatalysis has been well recognized to implicate in the emergence of life and is intrinsic to the biomolecular replication. Recently, an efficient template autocatalysis driven by solvent&#8208;free crystallization has been reported. Herein, we unveil the role of intermolecular hydrogen (H) bonds formed by amides in crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis (CDTA), which involves the autocatalytic activity, template selectivity, and thermal responsiveness. We found that the thermal&#8208;induced cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amides possibly affects the H&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated template ability of products for autocatalytic transformation. As a result, CDTA can be reversibly inhibited and activated by tuning the reaction temperatures. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Monodisperse Micron&#8208;Sized Polymer Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial vesicles are recognized as powerful platforms for a large body of research across the disciplines of chemistry, physics and biology. Despite the great progress, control of the size distribution to make uniform vesicles remains fundamentally difficult due to the highly uncontrollable growth kinetics, especially for micron&#8208;sized vesicles. Here we report a template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method to prepare monodisperse vesicles around 1 &#956;m from an alternating copolymer. The polymer forms nanodisks (ca. 9 nm) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), acting as seeds for subsequent growth. By adding water, the nanodisks gradually grow into larger circular bilayer nanosheets, which bend to crowns and continue to grow into uniform micron&#8208;sized vesicles. The first&#8208;order growth kinetics as well as the small size polydispersity index (&lt;0.1) suggests the living self&#8208;assembly characteristics. This work paves a new way in both living self&#8208;assembly and monodisperse polymer vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cu Single&#8208;atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Therapy, Photothermal Therapy, Cuproptosis, and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with atomically dispersed active sites are potential substitutes for natural enzymes. A systematic study of its multiple functions can in&#8208;depth understand SAzymes&#8217;s nature, which remains elusive. Here, we develop a novel ultrafast synthesis of sputtered SAzymes by in situ bombarding&#8208;embedding technique. Using this method, sputtered copper (Cu) SAzymes (CuSA) is developed with unreported unique planar Cu&#8208;C3 coordinated configuration. To enhance the tumor&#8208;specific targeting, we employ a bioorthogonal approach to engineer CuSA, denoted as CuSACO. CuSACO not only exhibits minimal off&#8208;target toxicity but also possesses exceptional ultrahigh catalase&#8208;, oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;like multienzyme activities, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation for effective tumor destruction. Surprisingly, CuSACO can release Cu ions in the presence of glutathione (GSH) to induce cuproptosis, enhancing the tumor treatment efficacy. Notably, CuSACO's remarkable photothermal properties enables precise photothermal therapy (PTT) on tumors. This, combined with nanoenzyme catalytic activities, cuproptosis and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of orthotopic breast tumors and gliomas, and lung metastasis. Our research highlights the potential of CuSACO as an innovative strategy to utilize multiple mechanism to enhance tumor therapeutic efficacy, broadening the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;like behavior and physiological mechanism of action of SAzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Rich Gel&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing abilities and high Li+ transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen&#8208;bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;rich gel&#8208;state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1 Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel&#8208;state&#8208;based LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Supernarrow Borophene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borophenes have sparked considerable interest owing to their fascinating physical characteristics and diverse polymorphism. However, borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) with widths less than 2 nm have not been achieved. Herein, we report the experimental realization of supernarrow BNRs. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy imaging with density functional theory modeling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, under the applied growth conditions, boron atoms can penetrate the outermost layer of Au(111) and form BNRs composed of a pair of zigzag (2,2) boron rows. The BNRs have a width self&#8208;contained to &#8764;1 nm and dipoles at the edges to keep them separated. They are embedded in the outermost Au layer and shielded on top by the evacuated Au atoms, free of the need for post&#8208;passivation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals distinct edge states, primarily attributed to the localized spin at the BNRs&#8217; zigzag edges. This work adds a new member to the boron material family and introduces a new physical feature to borophenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathodic Deposition&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Thin Glass MOF Films for High&#8208;Performance Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glass metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films can be fabricated from their crystalline counterparts through a melt&#8208;quenching process and are prospective candidates for gas separation because of the elimination of the grain boundaries in crystalline MOF films. However, current techniques are limited to producing glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, which leads to ultralow gas permeances. Here, we report a novel cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted synthesis of glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness as low as ~1 &#956;m. Electrochemical analyses and deposition experiments suggest that the cathodic deposition can lead to pure crystalline ZIF&#8208;62 films with a controllable thickness of ~2 &#956;m to ~15 &#956;m. Accordingly, glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness of ~1 &#956;m to ~10 &#956;m can be obtained after a thermal treatment. The fabricated defect&#8208;free glass ZIF&#8208;62 film measuring 2 &#956;m in thickness shows a remarkable CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 31.4 and 33.4, respectively, with a CO2 permeance which is over 30 times higher than the best&#8208;performing glass ZIF&#8208;62 films in literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Dense Supported Ruthenium Oxide Clusters via Directed Ion Exchange for Efficient Valorization of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;dense supported Ru oxide clusters prepared by directed ion exchange enable the efficient deep electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) under neutral conditions.







Abstract
Maximizing the loadings of active centers without aggregation for a supported catalyst is a grand challenge but essential for achieving high gravimetric catalytic activity, especially toward multi&#8208;step reactions. The oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a key biomass&#8208;derived platform molecule, into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a promising alternative to polyester monomer, is such a multi&#8208;step reaction that involves 6 proton and electron transfers. This process often demands strong alkaline environment but also suffers from the alkali&#8208;driven polymerization side&#8208;reaction. Meanwhile, neutral media ameliorates the polymerization, but lacks efficient catalyst toward deep oxidation. Herein, we devised a strategy of creating ultra&#8208;dense supported Ru oxide clusters via directed ion exchange in a Co hydroxyanion (CoHA) support material. Pyrimidine ligands were first incorporated into the CoHA interlayers, and the subsequent evacuation of pyrimidines created porous channels for the directed ion exchange with the built&#8208;in anions in CoHA, which allowed the dense and mono&#8208;disperse functionalization of RuCl62&#8722; anions and their resulting Ru oxide clusters. These ultra&#8208;dense Ru oxide clusters not only enable high HMF electrooxidation currents under neutral conditions but also create microscopic channels in&#8208;between the clusters for the expedited re&#8208;adsorption and oxidation of intermediates toward highly oxidized product, such as 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid (FFCA) and FDCA. A two&#8208;stage HMF oxidation process, consisting of ambient conversion of HMF into FFCA and FFCA oxidation into FDCA under 60&#8201;&#176;C, was eventually developed to first achieve a high FDCA yield of 92.1&#8201;% under neutral media with significantly reduced polymerization.

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Spiroaminals via Chiral Bifunctional Hydrogen Bonding Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals via chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance.







Abstract
Spiroaminals represent novel structural motifs prevalent in diverse natural products and biologically active molecules. Achieving their enantioselective synthesis is a highly desirable and challenging task in synthetic endeavors due to their intricate molecular frameworks. Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals using chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the possible stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance. Additionally, we validated the scalability of the reaction and demonstrated the synthesis of variable spiroaminal scaffolds, confirming the viability of our protocol.

         <title>Superoxide Radicals in Uranyl Peroxide Solids: Lasting Signatures Identified by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
U(VI) peroxide phases synthesized between 1945&#8211;2023 contained the superoxide radical with the number of spins related to the specific activity of the uranium X age.







Abstract
U(VI) peroxide phases (studtite and meta&#8208;studtite) are found throughout the nuclear fuel cycle and exist as corrosion products in high radiation fields. Peroxides are part of a family of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that include hydroperoxyl and superoxide species and are produced during alpha radiolysis of water. While U(VI) peroxides have been thoroughly investigated, the incorporation and stability of ROS species within studtite have not been validated. In the current study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to identify the presence of free radicals within a series of U(VI) peroxide samples containing depleted, highly enriched, and natural uranium. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the predicted EPR signals matched well with a superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8901;) species incorporated into the studtite structure, confirming the presence of ROS in the material. Further analysis of samples that were synthesized between 1945 and 2023 indicated that there is a correlation between the radical signal and the product of specific activity multiplied by age of the sample.

Density functional theory calculations indicated that the predicted EPR signals matched well with a superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;) species incorporated into the studtite structure, confirming the presence of ROS in the material. Further analysis of samples that were synthesized between 1945 and 2023 indicated that there is a correlation between the radical signal and the product of specific activity multiplied by age of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using an Osmium Complex as a Panchromatic Self&#8208;Photosensitized Catalyst: Utilization of Blue, Green, and Red Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Os complex that absorbs longer&#8208;wavelength light (350&#8211;700&#8197;nm) has been developed as a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955;&#8805;400&#8197;nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded with monochromatic blue (&#955;0=405&#8197;nm), green (&#955;0=525&#8197;nm), or red (&#955;0=630&#8197;nm) light with a high CO selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) represents an attractive approach for solar&#8208;energy storage and leads to the production of renewable fuels and valuable chemicals. Although some osmium (Os) photosensitizers absorb long wavelengths in the visible&#8208;light region, a self&#8208;photosensitized, mononuclear Os catalyst for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction has not yet been exploited. Here, we discovered that the introduction of an Os metal to a PNNP&#8208;type tetradentate ligand resulted in the absorption of light with longer&#8208;wavelength (350&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and that can be applied to a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955;&#8805;400&#8197;nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded under irradiation with blue (&#955;0=405&#8197;nm), green (&#955;0=525&#8197;nm), or red (&#955;0=630&#8197;nm) light to give CO with &gt;90&#8201;% selectivity. The quantum efficiency using red light was determined to be 12&#8201;% for the generation of CO. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the detection of intermediates using various spectroscopic techniques, including transient absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecule Aggregation for Nearly Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Sol Electrolyte to Advance Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries: The Case of Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc metal batteries. It spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates, inhibiting electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth. It also facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and boosts the Zn&#8208;ion transfer. Therefore, the electrolyte containing TPPS greatly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Zn metal as a promising anode of aqueous batteries faces severe challenges from dendrite growth and side reactions. Here, tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for advanced Zn anodes. It is interesting to note that TPPS spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates. As they adsorb on the Zn anode, the aggregates enhance the resistance to electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth compared to single molecules. Meanwhile, TPPS facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, and boosts the transference number of Zn2+ up to 0.95. Therefore, anion&#8208;related side reactions and anion&#8208;induced electrode overpotentials are reduced accordingly. In this context, the electrolyte containing TPPS exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Even under a high loading of MnO2 (25&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.7), and a lean electrolyte (15&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), the full cells still represent a higher cumulative capacity compared to the reported data. The advantages of this electrolyte are also adapted to other cathode materials. The pouch cells of Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O realize a capacity of ~0.35&#8197;Ah at 0.4&#8197;C under harsh conditions.

         <title>Monitoring ROS Responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based Nanoparticle Mediated Ferroptosis&amp;Immunotherapy via 129Xe MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supplying ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4 nanoparticle was designed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy by ROS&#8208;mediated size reduction and charge reversion. Moreover, the 129Xe MRI of lung metastases showed significant differences in lung ventilation defects in the treatment and control groups, indicating the great potential of 129Xe MRI for monitoring the immunotherapeutic efficacy of lung metastatic cancer.







Abstract
The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late&#8208;stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe3O4 by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune&#8208;activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H2O2. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H2O2, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized 129Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered. The ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced immunotherapy combined with non&#8208;radiation evaluation methodology paves a new way for designing novel theranostic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Trifluoromethylation of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Mild Functionalization and Tunable p&#8208;Type Doping Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and versatile method is reported for the functionalization of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 with surface&#8208;bound trifluoromethyl groups using an easily&#8208;prepared electrophilic trifluoromethylation reagent. The nature of the adlayer is extensively characterized to reveal covalent bonding of trifluoromethyl groups at surface chalcogens and defect sites. Trifluoromethylation induces tunable p&#8208;type doping as demonstrated through photoluminescence and charge transport measurements.







Abstract
Chemical modification is a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. Here we report the electrophilic trifluoromethylation of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 under mild conditions using the reagent trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TTT). Chemical characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the trifluoromethyl groups bind covalently to surface chalcogen atoms as well as oxygen substitution sites. Trifluoromethylation induces p&#8208;type doping in the underlying 2D material, enabling the modulation of charge transport and optical emission properties in WSe2. This work introduces a versatile and efficient method for tailoring the optical and electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra&#8208;cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au25(pMBA)18 (pMBA = 4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter&#8208;cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well&#8208;designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter&#8208;cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au25(pMBA)18 at the molecular level to enhance intra&#8208;cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Design of Highly Stable Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymer for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconductive PCP with excellent chemical and thermal stability was constructed using the &#8220;modular design&#8221; approach. The Fe&#8208;pyNDI exhibits a well&#8208;defined structure and shows promise as a new platform for investigating electrocatalysts for superior catalytic performance in reducing nitrate to ammonia. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra analysis during the reaction revealed that some of the Fe3+ present in Fe&#8208;pyNDI underwent reduction to Fe2+, which serves as a potential active species for the nitrate reduction reaction.







Abstract
Developing highly stable porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with integrated electrical conductivity is crucial for advancing our understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms and the structure&#8211;activity relationship of electrocatalysts. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge because of the electrochemical instability observed in most PCPs. Herein, we develop a &#8220;modular design&#8221; strategy to construct electrochemically stable semiconducting PCP, namely, Fe&#8208;pyNDI, which incorporates a chain&#8208;type Fe&#8208;pyrazole metal cluster and &#960;&#8208;stacking column with effective synergistic effects. The three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) technique resolves the precise structure. Both theoretical and experimental investigation confirms that the &#960;&#8208;stacking column in Fe&#8208;pyNDI can provide an efficient electron transport path and enhance the structural stability of the material. As a result, Fe&#8208;pyNDI can serve as an efficient model electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia with a superior ammonia yield of 339.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (14677&#8197;&#956;g&#8197;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1) and a faradaic efficiency of 87&#8201;% at neutral electrolyte, which is comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that during the reaction, the structure of Fe&#8208;pyNDI can be kept, while part of the Fe3+ in Fe&#8208;pyNDI was reduced in situ to Fe2+, which serves as the potential active species for NO3RR.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks in Adsorption and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the fields of catalysis and adsorption for ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), highlighting the relationship between ionic structures and properties. The insights into the future development of design strategies and applications based on ionic COFs are also offered.







Abstract
The ion extraction and electro/photo catalysis are promising methods to address environmental and energy issues. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of promising template to construct absorbents and catalysts because of their stable frameworks, high surface areas, controllable pore environments, and well&#8208;defined catalytic sites. Among them, ionic COFs as unique class of crystalline porous materials, with charges in the frameworks or along the pore walls, have shown different properties and resulting performance in these applications with those from charge&#8208;neutral COFs. In this review, current research progress based on the ionic COFs for ion extraction and energy conversion, including cationic/anionic materials and electro/photo catalysis is reviewed in terms of the synthesis strategy, modification methods, mechanisms of adsorption and catalysis, as well as applications. Finally, we demonstrated the current challenges and future development of ionic COFs in design strategies and applications.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Ni/Ni(OH)2 Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Boosts Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Ampere&#8208;Level Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia provides a green alternate to the Haber&#8208;Bosch method, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics and a low yield rate. The nitrate reduction follows a tandem reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequent nitrite hydrogenation to generate ammonia, and the ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) is limited by the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we design a heterostructure catalyst to remedy the above issues, which consists of Ni nanosphere core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell (Ni/Ni(OH)2). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy reveals Ni and Ni(OH)2 are interconvertible according to the applied potential, facilitating the cascade nitrate reduction synergistically. Consequently, it attains superior electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance with an ammonia FE of 98.50% and a current density of 0.934 A cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.476 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and exhibits an average ammonia yield rate of 84.74 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 during the 102&#8208;hour stability test, which is highly superior to the reported catalysts tested under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations corroborate the synergistic effect of Ni and Ni(OH)2 in the tandem reaction of nitrate reduction. Moreover, the Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalyst also possesses good capability for methanol oxidation and thus is used to establish a system coupling with nitrate reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M = Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M = Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8208; nitridometallate anions. Magnetic measurements confirm that Cr and Mo are in the M6+ state, but the M = Mn phase has an anomalously small paramagnetic moment and large cell volume. Neutron powder diffraction data are fitted using an anion&#8208;excess La3MnN5.30 model (space group I4/mcm, a = 6.81587(9) &#197; and c = 11.22664(18) &#197; at 200 K) in which Mn is close to the +7 state. Excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials has not been previously reported, and this or other substitution mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Carbomagnesiation for Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a pressing need for methods that can connect enantioenriched organic compounds with readily accessible building blocks via asymmetric functionalization of unreactive chemical bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, the asymmetric chemoselective cleavage of two unactivated C(Ar)&#8208;O bonds in the same molecule is disclosed for the first time through an unusual nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction facilitates the evolution of a novel atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization. Utilizing readily available dibenzo bicyclic substrates, diverse valuable axially chiral biaryls are furnished with high efficiencies. Synthetic elaborations showcase the application potential of this method.

Herein, the asymmetric chemoselective cleavage of two unactivated C(Ar)-O bonds in the same molecule is disclosed for the first time through an unusual nickel-catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction facilitates the evolution of a novel atroposelective ring-opening difunctionalization. Utilizing readily available dibenzo bicyclic substrates, diverse valuable axially chiral biaryls are furnished with high efficiencies. Synthetic elaborations showcase the application potential of this method. The features of this method include good atom-economy, multiple roles of the nucleophile, and a simple catalytic system that enables the precise magnesiation of an &#945;-C(Ar)-O bond and arylation of a &#946;-C(Ar)-O bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Stereoconvergent Synthesis and Immunological Activity of a Unique Pentasaccharide from the Cell Wall Polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial cell&#8208;surface polysaccharides are involved in various biological processes and have attracted widespread attention as potential targets for developing carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs. However, the accessibility of structurally well&#8208;defined polysaccharide or related active oligosaccharide domains remains challenging. Herein, we describe an efficiently stereocontrolled approach for the first total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit containing four difficult&#8208;to&#8208;construct 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7. The features of our approach include: 1) acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled glycosylation to stereoselectively construct&#160;&#160; two challenging rare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ManA2,3(NAc)2 (&#946;&#8208;2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxymannuronic acid) linkages, 2) combination use of 6&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilyl (6&#8208;O&#8208;TBDPS)&#8208;mediated steric shielding effect and ether solvent effect to stereoselectively install a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic&#160;linkage, 3) bulky 4,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene (DTBS)&#8208;directed glycosylation to stereospecifically construct a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;galactosidic linkage, 4) stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation to rapidly assemble the target pentasaccharide. Immunological activity tests suggest that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy Synthetic Access to High&#8208;Melting Sulfurated Copolymers and their Self&#8208;Assembling Diblock Copolymers from Phenylisothiocyanate and Oxetane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of phenylisothiocyanate and oxetane yields sulfurated polymers with melting points of up to 181&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic linkage control and minimal substitution are crucial to maximizing melting temperatures. Their controlled synthesis and tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents provide access to amphiphiles that can be used in crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, forming cylindrical micelles.







Abstract
Although sulfurated polymers promise unique properties, their controlled synthesis, particularly when it comes to complex and functional architectures, remains challenging. Here, we show that the copolymerization of oxetane and phenyl isothiocyanate selectively yields polythioimidocarbonates as a new class of sulfur containing polymers, with narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn=5&#8211;80&#8197;kg/mol with &#272;&#8804;1.2; Mn,max=124&#8197;kg/mol) and high melting points of up to 181&#8201;&#176;C. The method tolerates different substituent patterns on both the oxetane and the isothiocyanate. Self&#8208;nucleation experiments reveal that &#960;&#8208;stacking of phenyl substituents, the presence of unsubstituted polymer backbones, and the kinetically controlled linkage selectivity are key factors in maximising melting points. The increased tolerance to macro&#8208;chain transfer agents and the controlled propagation allows the synthesis of double crystalline and amphiphilic diblock copolymers, which can be assembled into micellar&#8208; and worm&#8208;like structures with amorphous cores in water. In contrast, crystallization driven self&#8208;assembly in ethanol gives cylindrical micelles or platelets.

         <title>Network Polymer Properties Engineered Through Polymer Backbone Dispersity and Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks using chains of distinct backbone length variability were developed with control over both length and dispersity. The impact of primary chain length dispersity on material properties including strength, swelling, adhesion and extensibility were evaluated. Materials with intermediate primary chain dispersity showed superior materials properties.







Abstract
Dispersity (&#208; or Mw/Mn) is an important parameter in material design and as such can significantly impact the properties of polymers. Here, polymer networks with independent control over the molecular weight and dispersity of the linear chains that form the material are developed. Using a RAFT polymerization approach, a library of polymers with dispersity ranging from 1.2&#8212;1.9 for backbone chain&#8208;length (DP) 100, and 1.4&#8212;3.1 for backbone chain&#8208;length 200 were developed and transformed to networks through post&#8208;polymerization crosslinking to form disulfide linkers. The tensile, swelling, and adhesive properties were explored, finding that both at DP 100 and DP 200 the swelling ratio, tensile strength, and extensibility were superior at intermediate dispersity (1.3&#8212;1.5 for DP 100 and 1.6&#8212;2.1 for DP 200) compared to materials with either substantially higher or lower dispersity. Furthermore, adhesive properties for materials with chains of intermediate dispersity at DP 200 revealed enhanced performance compared to the very low or high dispersity chains.

         <title>Exploring High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism in Carbonic Acid through Direct Synthesis from Carbon Dioxide Clathrate Hydrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide hydrate upon low temperature compression transforms into different crystalline polymorphs of elusive carbonic acid. In view of the widespread diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in the Universe, this finding represents a valuable support for understanding and modelling the complex crustal composition of Solar and exoSolar icy bodies.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is widespread in astrochemically relevant environments, often coexisting with water (H2O) ices and thus triggering a great interest regarding the possible formation of their adducts under various thermodynamic conditions. Amongst them, solid carbonic acid (H2CO3) remains elusive, yet being widely studied. Synthetic routes followed for its production have always been characterised by drastic irradiation on solid ice mixtures or complex procedures on fluid samples (such as laser heating at moderate to high pressures). Here we report about a simpler yet effective synthetic route to obtain two diverse carbonic acid crystal structures from the fast, cold compression of pristine clathrate hydrate samples. The two distinct polymorphs we obtained, differing in the water content, have been deeply characterised via spectroscopic and structural techniques to assess their composition and their astonishing pressure stability, checked up to half a megabar, also highlighting the complex correlations between them so to compile a detailed phase diagram of this system. These results may have a profound impact on the prediction and modelisation of the complex chemistry which characterises many icy bodies of our Solar System.

         <title>Vertically Concentrated Quantum Wells Enabling Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a thermal&#8208;gradient annealing treatment to address the issue of vertical quantum well (QW) polydispersity in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained, which enables a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) systems exist heightened sensitivity to the domain distribution. The top&#8208;down crystallization mode will lead to a vertical gradient distribution of quantum well (QW) structure, which is unfavorable for deep&#8208;blue emission. Herein, a thermal gradient annealing treatment is proposed to address the polydispersity issue of vertical QWs in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The formation of large&#8208;n domains at the upper interface of the perovskite film can be effectively inhibited by introducing a low&#8208;temperature source in the annealing process. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained. As a result, the fabricated device delivers a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%. Green and sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with remarkable EQE of 21.83&#8201;% and 17.51&#8201;% are also successfully achieved, respectively, by using the same strategy.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a thermal-gradient annealing treatment to address the issue of vertical quantum well (QW) polydispersity in quasi-2D perovskites. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained, which enables a narrow and stable deep-blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) systems exist heightened sensitivity to the domain distribution. The top-down crystallization mode will lead to a vertical gradient distribution of quantum well (QW) structure, which is unfavorable for deep-blue emission. Herein, a thermal gradient annealing treatment is proposed to address the polydispersity issue of vertical QWs in quasi-2D perovskites. The formation of large-n domains at the upper interface of the perovskite film can be effectively inhibited by introducing a low-temperature source in the annealing process. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained. As a result, the fabricated device delivers a narrow and stable deep-blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%. Green and sky-blue PeLEDs with remarkable EQE of 21.83&#8201;% and 17.51&#8201;% are also successfully achieved, respectively, by using the same strategy. The findings provide a universal strategy across the entire quasi-2D perovskites, paving the way for future practical application of PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coral &#8208;Inspired Terahertz&#8211;Infrared Bi&#8208;Stealth Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of electronic skin with dual stealth functionality is crucial for enabling devices to operate effectively in dynamic electromagnetic environments, thereby facilitating intelligent electromagnetic protection for autonomous perception. However, achieving compatibility between terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) stealth technologies remains largely unexplored due to their inherent contradictions. Herein, inspired by natural corals, a novel coral&#8208;like multi&#8208;scale composite foam (CMSF) was proposed that ingeniously reconciles these contradictions. The design capitalizes on the conductive network and heat insulation properties of the foam skeleton, the loss effects and low infrared emission of metal particles, and the infrared transparency of magneto&#8208;optical materials. This approach leads to the realization of a THz&#8208;IR bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin concept. The CMSF exhibits a maximum reflection loss of 84.8 dB in the terahertz band, while its infrared stealth capability ensures environmental adaptability under varying temperatures. Furthermore, the electronic skin exhibits exceptional sensitivity and reliability as a wearable device for perceiving environmental changes. This advanced material, combining multispectral stealth with sensing capabilities, holds immense potential for applications ranging from camouflage technology to smart wearables.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Stabilisation of Remarkably Bent Tetra&#8208;Cationic Tetra&#8208;radical Intermolecular Fe(III) &#956;&#8208;Oxo Tetranuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A hitherto unknown series of air stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, remarkably bent tetra&#8208;cation tetra&#8208;radical intermolecular &#956;&#8208;oxo tetranuclear complexes has been reported and structurally characterised. These species facilitate long&#8208;range charge/radical delocalisation through the bridge across the entire tetranuclear unit, manifesting unusually intense NIR bands. Assorted spin states of Fe(III) centres are stabilised: terminal six&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the admixed&#8208;intermediate spin states, while the central five&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the high&#8208;spin states. A strong exchange coupling among the centres, coupled with the bent nature of the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Fe moiety, promotes intense NIR bands.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown series of air stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, remarkably bent tetra&#8208;cation tetra&#8208;radical intermolecular Fe(III) &#956;&#8208;oxo tetranuclear complex, isolated from the dication diradical diiron(III) porphyrin dimers, has been synthesised and spectroscopically characterised along with single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of two such molecules. These species facilitate long&#8208;range charge/radical delocalisation through the bridge across the entire tetranuclear unit manifesting an unusually intense NIR band. Assorted spin states of Fe(III) centres are stabilised within these unique tetranuclear frameworks: terminal six&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the admixed intermediate spin states while the central five&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the high&#8208;spin states. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated strong antiferromagnetic coupling for the Fe(III)&#8722;O&#8722;Fe(III) unit while the exchange interactions between the Fe centres and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are weaker as supported both by magnetic data and DFT calculations. The nature of orbital overlap between the SOMOs of Fe(III) and &#960;* orbital of the porphyrin was found to rationalise the observed exchange coupling, establishing such a complex magnetic exchange in this tetranuclear model with a significant bioinorganic relevance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond network breakdown in the CO2 photoreduction system can suppress H2 evolution and boost CO production, as reported by Chengcheng Liu, Weiqiao Deng et&#8197;al. in a Research Article (e202316991). Photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s are designed as photocatalysts owing to their robust hydrogen bonding with solvents. The suppression of H2 evolution in photocatalytic CO2 reduction was effectively achieved by disrupting the hydrogen bond network with solvent additives.

         <dc:description>Emerging high entropy compounds (HECs) have attracted huge attention in electrochemical energy&#8208;related applications. The features of ultrafine size and carbon incorporation show great potential to boost the ion&#8208;storage kinetics of HECs. However, they are rarely reported because high&#8208;temperature calcination tends to result in larger crystallites, phase separation, and carbon reduction. Herein, using the NaCl self&#8208;assembly template method, by introducing a high&#8208;pressure field in the calcination process, the atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited for the general formation of HECs, and the HEC aggregation is inhibited for obtaining ultrafine size. The general preparation of ultrafine&#8208;sized (&lt; 10 nm) HECs (nitrides, oxides, sulfides, and phosphates) anchored on porous carbon composites is realized. They are demonstrated by combining advanced characterization technologies with theoretical computations. Ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy sulfides&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/porous carbon (HES&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/PC) as representative anodes exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;ion storage kinetics and capacities (a high rating capacity of 278 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1 for full cell and a high cycling capacity of 281 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1 after 6000 cycles for half cell) due to the combining advantages of high entropy effect, ultrafine size, and PC incorporation. Our work provides a new opportunity for designing and fabricating ultrafine&#8208;sized HECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery, Structure, and Engineering of a cis&#8208;Geranylfarnesyl Diphosphate Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>cis&#8208;Prenyltransferases (cis&#8208;PTs) catalyze the sequential head&#8208;to&#8208;tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed E&#8208;Z prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; yet, the specific enzymes synthesizing cis&#8208;C25 prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. In this study, we present the discovery and characterization of a cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids, including three C25 and three C20 variants. We further determine the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all&#8208;cis&#8208;C20 polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine ScGFPPS's selectivity for cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of cis&#8208;PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in cis&#8208;PTs engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile generation of heterotelechelic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s towards accelerated exploration of poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the end&#8208;groups of biocompatible polymers is crucial for enabling polymer&#8208;based therapeutics and nanomedicine. Typically, end&#8208;group diversification is a challenging and time&#8208;consuming endeavor, especially for polymers pre&#8208;pared via ionic polymerization mechanisms with limited functional group tolerance. In this study, we present a facile end&#8208;group diversification approach for poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx), enabling quick and reliable production of hetero&#8208;telechelic polymers to facilitate POxylation. The approach relies on the careful tuning of reaction parameters to establish differential reactivity of a pentafluorobenzyl initiator fragment and the living oxazolinium chain&#8208;end, allowing the selective introduction of N&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;nucleophiles via the termination of the polymerization, and a consecutive nucleophilic para&#8208;fluoro substitution. The value of this approach for the accelerated development of nanomedicine is demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined lipid&#8208;polymer conjugates and POx&#8208;polypeptide block&#8208;copolymers, which are well&#8208;suited for drug and gene delivery. Furthermore, we investigated the application of a lipid&#8208;POx conjugate for the formulation and delivery of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles for immunization against the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus, underscoring the value of POx as a biocompatible polymer platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Adhesion Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Biobased Microgels for Controlled Delivery of Pesticides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Widespread use of plant protection agents in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. Apart from active ingredients, the environmental impact of auxiliary synthetic polymers should be minimized if they are highly persistent. An alternative to synthetic polymers is the use of natural polysaccharides, which are abundant and biodegradable. In this study, we explore pectin microgels functionalized with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) to be used as an alternative biobased pesticide delivery system. Using complexed Cu2+ as the active ingredient, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevented infection of grapevine plants with downy mildew under semi&#8208;field conditions on par with commercial copper pesticides. By using anchor peptides, the microgels tightly bind to the leaf surface, exhibiting excellent rain fastness and prolonged fungicidal activity. Finally, P&#8208;MAPs are shown to be easily degradable by enzymes found in nature, demonstrating their negligible long&#8208;term impact on the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;Rich Amines by Aminative Carbofunctionalization of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylamines form the backbone of countless nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules possessing desirable biological properties. Despite advances in amine synthesis through transition metal catalysis and photoredox chemistry, multicomponent reactions that leverage inexpensive materials to transform abundant chemical feedstocks into three&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;substituted alkylamines bearing complex substitution patterns remain scarce. Here, we report the design of a catalyst&#8208;free electroreductive manifold that merges amines, carbonyl compounds and carbon&#8208;based radical acceptors under ambient conditions without rigorous exclusion of air and moisture. Key to this aminative carbofunctionalization process is the chemoselective generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;amino radical intermediates that readily couple with electrophilic partners, providing straightforward access to architecturally intricate alkylamines and drug&#8208;like scaffolds which are inaccessible by conventional means.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrooted&#8208;type metal&#8208;support interaction boosting oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyfluorinated Organic Diammonium Induced Lead Iodide&#160;&#8203;&#160;Arrangement for Efficient Two&#8208;Step&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two&#8208;step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP&#8208;PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP&#8208;PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04% was achieved in a large&#8208;area perovskite module (100 cm2).

Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4,4&#8242;-diyl)-dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low-dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP-PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP-PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP-based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04% was achieved in a large-area perovskite module (100 cm2). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Alloy Catalysts Beyond Pd for Selective Hydrogenation of Reformate via First&#8208;principle Screening with Consideration of H&#8208;coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The highly selective hydrogenation to remove olefins is a significant refining approach for the reformate. Herein, a library of transition metal for reformate hydrogenation is tested experimentally to validate the predictive level of catalytic activity from our theoretical framework, which combines ab initio calculations and microkinetic modeling, with consideration of surface H&#8208;coverage effect on hydrogenation kinetics. The favorable H coverage of specific alloy surface under relevant hydrogenation condition, is found to be determined by its corresponding alloy composition. Besides, olefin hydrogenation rate is determined as a function of two descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energies of atomic hydrogen, paving the way to computationally screen on metal component in the periodic table. Evaluation of 172 bimetallic alloys based on the activity volcano map, as well as benzene hydrogenation rate, identifies prospective superior candidates and experimentally confirms that Zn3Ir1 outperforms pure Pd catalysts for the selective hydrogenation refining of reformate. The insights into H&#8208;coverage&#8208;related microkinetic modelling have enabled us to both theoretically understand experimental findings and identify novel catalysts, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principle simulations and industrial applications. This work provides useful guidance for experimental catalyst design, which can be easily extended to other hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single&#8208;electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe&#8208;SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe&#8208;SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8208;C/C&#8208;X bonds. What's more, Fe&#8208;SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We em&#8208;ployed it to develop a new electro&#8208;oxidative ring&#8208;opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe&#8208;SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram&#8208;scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Liquid Crystal&#8208;Templated Chiral Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with mechanically tunable circularly polarized luminance (CPL) were fabricated by in situ chemical cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed polymerizable CsPbX3 PQD nanomonomers into cholesteric elastic networks. This work can pave an avenue for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in dynamic information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.







Abstract
Endowing perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) offers great promise for innovative chiroptical applications, but the existing strategies are inefficient in acquiring stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible chiral perovskite films with large, tunable dissymmetry factor (glum) and long&#8208;term stability. Here, we report a strategy for the design and synthesis of luminescent cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (Lumin&#8208;CLCE) films with mechanically tunable CPL, which is enabled by liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral self&#8208;assembly and in situ covalent cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed photopolymerizable CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) PQD nanomonomers into the elastic polymer networks. The resulting Lumin&#8208;CLCE films showcase circularly polarized structural color in natural light and noticeable CPL with a maximum glum value of up to 1.5 under UV light. The manipulation of CPL intensity and rotation direction is achieved by controlling the self&#8208;assembled helicoidal nanostructure and the handedness of soft helices. A significant breakthrough lies in the achievement of a reversible, mechanically tunable perovskite&#8208;based CPL switch activated by biaxial stretching, which enables flexible, dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels capable of decrypting preset information in specific polarization states. This work can provide new insights for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.

         <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4 + 4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has been centralizing on dimerization between 1,3&#8208;diene type substrates. Here, we extend a [4&#963; + 4&#960; &#8208; 1] and [4&#963; + 4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access the 7/8&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through Rh&#8208;catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad scope (&gt;40 examples) of 5&#8208;6&#8208;7 and 5&#8208;6&#8208;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained with good yields (up to 90%). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations, kinetic monitoring and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, the 5&#8208;6&#8208;7 tricycle 2v was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64 &#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related fatal diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Distinct Behaviors between Bifunctional and Binary Organoborane Catalysts through Terpolymerization of Epoxide, CO2, and Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl borane compounds&#8208;mediated polymerizations have expanded to Lewis pair polymerization, free radical polymerization, ionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, and polyhomologation. The bifunctional organoborane catalysts that contain the Lewis acid and ammonium or phosphonium salt in one molecule have demonstrated superior catalytic performance for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of epoxides and ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 than their two&#8208;component analogues, i.e., the blend of organoborane and ammonium or phosphonium salt. To explore the origin of the differences of the one&#8208;component and two&#8208;component organoborane catalysts, here we conducted a systematic investigation on the catalytic performances of these two kinds of organoborane catalysts via terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride. The resultant terpolymers produced independently by bifunctional and binary organoborane catalyst exhibited distinct microstructures, where a series of gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers with varying polyester content were afforded using the bifunctional catalyst, while tapering diblock terpolymers were obtained using the binary system. The bifunctional catalyst enhances the competitiveness of CO2 insertion than anhydride, which leads to the premature incorporation of CO2 into the polymer chains and ultimately results in the formation of gradient terpolymers. DFT calculations revealed the role of electrostatic interaction and charge distribution caused by intramolecular synergistic effect for bifunctional organoborane catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;Induced Cluster Consolidation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Sieving Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit dynamic phase&#8208;transition behavior under external stimuli could have great potential in adsorptive separations. Here we report on a zinc&#8208;based microporous MOF (JNU&#8208;80) and its reversible transformation between two crystalline phases: large pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP) and narrow pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP). Specifically, JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP can undergo a dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation under heat treatment, resulting in JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP with a reduced channel that allows exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers. We further demonstrate the fabrication of MOF&#8208;polymer composite (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP&#8208;block) and its application in the purification of di&#8208;branched isomers from liquid&#8208;phase hexane mixtures (98% di&#8208;branched) at room temperature, affording the di&#8208;branched hexane isomers with 99.5% purity and close to 90% recovery rate over ten cycles. This work illustrates an interesting dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation in MOF structure and the ensuing channel shrinkage for sieving di&#8208;branched hexane isomers, which may have important implications for the development of MOFs with dynamic behavior and their potential applications in non&#8208;thermal driven separation technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Redox Reaction Sites for Pseudocapacitance Based on Ti and &#8208;P Functional Groups of Ti3C2PBrx MXene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8208;0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8208;P) through a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase reaction. The acquisition of &#8208;P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (&#8208;Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After &#8208;Br is replaced with &#8208;P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360 mF cm&#8208;2) at 20 mV s&#8208;1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102 mF cm&#8208;2). At a current density of 5 mA cm&#8208;2 after 10000 cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8208;P and Ti.</dc:description>

Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4-0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (-P) through a two-step gas-phase reaction. The acquisition of -P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (-Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After -Br is replaced with -P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360 mF cm-2) at 20 mV s-1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102 mF cm-2). At a current density of 5 mA cm-2 after 10000 cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased.

         <title>Attenuating N&#8208;Oxyl Decomposition for Improved Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work details a new N&#8208;oxyl scaffold that is a promising hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. Although the conventional N&#8208;oxyl catalyst design within the phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl scaffold provides modest improvement on either reactivity or stability, the increase of one parameter often strongly impacts the other. For the first time, we found that within hydantoin&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl scaffold, the N&#8208;oxyl persistence can be increased without sacrificing reactivity.







Abstract
The design of N&#8208;oxyl hydrogen atom transfer catalysts has proven challenging to date. Previous efforts have focused on the functionalization of the archetype, phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl. Driven in part by the limited options for modification of this structure, this strategy has provided only modest improvements in reactivity and/or solubility. Our previous mechanistic efforts suggested that while the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyls of the phthalimide are necessary to maximize the O&#8722;H bond dissociation enthalpy of the HAT product hydroxylamine and overall reaction thermodynamics, they undergo nucleophilic substitution leading to catalyst decomposition. In an attempt to minimize this vulnerability, we report the characterization of N&#8208;oxyl catalysts wherein the aryl ring in PINO is replaced with the combination of a substituted heteroatom and quaternary carbon. By rendering one carbonyl carbon less electrophilic and the other less sterically accessible, the corresponding N1&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydantoin&#8208;N3&#8208;oxyl radical showed significantly higher stability than PINO as well as a modest improvement in reactivity. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in new scaffold design may accelerate future HAT catalyst discovery and development.

         <title>Achieving Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Cascade Cationic Insertion in Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Playing a &#8220;cascade cationic insertion&#8221; trick to achieve strong CPL (with PLQY of ~100&#8201;%) in lead&#8208;free metal halides with simultaneous high glum values reaching &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;2 from only achiral building blocks.







Abstract
Generating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and dissymmetry factor (glum) is difficult due to usually unmatched electric transition dipole moment (&#956;) and magnetic transition dipole moment (m) of materials. Herein we tackle this issue by playing a &#8220;cascade cationic insertion&#8221; trick to achieve strong CPL (with PLQY of ~100&#8201;%) in lead&#8208;free metal halides with high glum values reaching &#8722;2.3&#215;10&#8722;2 without using any chiral inducers. Achiral solvents of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) infiltrate the crystal lattice via asymmetric hydrogen bonding, distorting the perovskite structure to induce the &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; chirality. Surprisingly, additional insertion of Cs+ cation to substitute partial (CH3)2NH2+ transforms the chiral space group to achiral but the crystal maintains chiroptical activity. Further doping of Sb3+ stimulates strong photoluminescence as a result of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) formation without disturbing the crystal framework. The chiral perovskites of indium&#8208;antimony chlorides embedded on LEDs chips demonstrate promising potential as CPL emitters. Our work presents rare cases of chiroptical activity of highly luminescent perovskites from only achiral building blocks via spontaneous resolution as a result of symmetry breaking.

         <title>Ruthenium Single Atomic Sites Surrounding the Support Pit with Exceptional Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;atomic Ru sites anchored on Ni(OH)x (SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) with high content of vacancies and pits are synthesized by a photoreduction strategy. Single&#8208;atomic Ru sites are anchored on vacancies and near pits in SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x. Pits afford the adsorption of CO2 and Ru sites help with converting the as&#8208;adsorbed CO2, thus improving the catalytic performance of CO2RR.







Abstract
Single&#8208;metal atomic sites and vacancies can accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and enhance photocatalytic performance in photocatalysis. In this study, a series of nickel hydroxide nanoboards (Ni(OH)x NBs) with different loadings of single&#8208;atomic Ru sites (w&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) were synthesized via a photoreduction strategy. In such catalysts, single&#8208;atomic Ru sites are anchored to the vacancies surrounding the pits. Notably, the SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x with 0.60&#8197;wt&#8201;% Ru loading (0.60&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) exhibits the highest catalytic performance (27.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). Either superfluous (0.64&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 18.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1; 3.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 9.4&#8197;mmol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) or scarce (0.06&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 15.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1; 0.29&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 21.95&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1; 0.58&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 23.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) of Ru sites have negative effect on its catalytic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results revealed that CO2 can be adsorbed in the pits; single&#8208;atomic Ru sites can help with the conversion of as&#8208;adsorbed CO2 and lower the energy of *COOH formation accelerating the reaction; the excessive single&#8208;atomic Ru sites occupy vacancies that retard the completion of CO2RR.

Notably, the SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with 0.60&#8197;wt&#8201;% Ru loading (0.60-SA-Ru/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits the highest catalytic performance (27.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) during the photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Either superfluous (0.64&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 18.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; 3.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 9.4&#8197;mmol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) or scarce (0.06&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 15.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; 0.29&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 21.95&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; 0.58&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 23.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of Ru sites have negative effect on its catalytic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results revealed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be adsorbed in the pits; single-atomic Ru sites can help with the conversion of as-adsorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and lower the energy of *COOH formation accelerating the reaction; the excessive single-atomic Ru sites occupy vacancies that retard the completion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mercury&#8208;Group&#8197;13 Metal Covalent Bonds: A Systematic Comparison of Aluminyl, Gallyl and Indyl Metallo&#8208;ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aided by the syntheses of potassium indyl reagents, access is possible for the first time to a complete series of metal&#8208;trielyl complexes featuring the same xanthene&#8208;derived NON&#8208;framework. Analysis of mercury compounds of the type (boryl)HgE(NON) (E=Al, Ga, In) by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical methods shows that the aluminyl metallo&#8208;ligand [(NON)Al]&#8722; is the most potent &#963;&#8208;donor.







Abstract
Bimetallic compounds containing direct metal&#8208;group&#8197;13 element bonds have been shown to display unprecedented patterns of cooperative reactivity towards small molecules, which can be influenced by the identity of the group&#8197;13 element. In this context, we present here a systematic appraisal of group&#8197;13 metallo&#8208;ligands of the type [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) for E=Al, Ga and In, through a comparison of structural and spectroscopic parameters associated with the trans L or X ligands in linear d10 complexes of the types LM{E(NON)} and XM&#8242;{E(NON)}. These studies are facilitated by convenient syntheses (from the In(I) precursor, InCp) of the potassium indyl species [{K(NON)In}&#8901;KCp]n (1) and [(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2K2Cp] [(NON)In] (1&#8242;), and lead to the first structural characterisation of Ag&#8722;In and Hg&#8722;E (E=Al, In) covalent bonds. The resulting structural, spectroscopic and quantum chemical probes of Ag/Hg complexes are consistent with markedly stronger &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities of the aluminyl ligand, [(NON)Al]&#8722;, over its gallium and indium counterparts.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Isomerization of Borylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes Enabled by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorbic acid&#8208;based C5 units are ubiquitous in natural products. To complement biosynthesis algorithms, a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization of &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted dienes has been achieved by selective energy transfer catalysis (E&#8201;:&#8201;Z up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Application of the method in stereospecific [4+2] and [2+2] cycloaddition processes is also disclosed to generate cyclic products with four contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
Configurationally&#8208;defined dienes are pervasive across the bioactive natural product spectrum, where they typically manifest themselves as sorbic acid&#8208;based fragments. These C5 motifs reflect the biosynthesis algorithms that facilitate their construction. To complement established biosynthetic paradigms, a chemical platform to facilitate the construction of stereochemically defined, functionalizable dienes by light&#8208;enabled isomerization has been devised. Enabled by selective energy transfer catalysis, a variety of substituted &#946;&#8208;boryl sorbic acid derivatives can be isomerized in a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3). Directionality is guided by a stabilizing nO&#8594;pB interaction in the product: this constitutes a formal anti&#8208;hydroboration of the starting alkyne. This operationally simple reaction employs low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and is complete in 1&#8197;h. X&#8208;ray analysis supports the hypothesis that the nO&#8594;pB interaction leads to chromophore bifurcation: this provides a structural foundation for selective energy transfer.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells Enabled by 1,3,4&#8208;Selenadiazole&#8208;Containing Crystalline Small Molecule with Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fibrilization of the small molecule acceptor by adding a trace amount of small molecule donors and fibril network optimization of the donor layer by introducing another polymer donor resulted in an optimal double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer and an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.38&#8201;% for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells.







Abstract
A double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer morphology is recognized as an ideal structure facilitating exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed OSCs (LbL&#8208;OSCs), polymer donors and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are separately deposited, and it is challenging to realize a fibril network of pure SMAs with the absence of tight interchain entanglement as polymers. In this work, crystalline small molecule donors (SMDs), named TDZ&#8208;3TR and SeDZ&#8208;3TR, were designed and introduced into the L8&#8208;BO acceptor solution, forcing the phase separation and molecular fibrilization. SeDZ&#8208;3TR showed higher crystallinity and lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO acceptor than TDZ&#8208;3TR, enabling more driving force to favor the phase separation and better molecular fibrilization of L8&#8208;BO. On the other hand, two donor polymers of PM6 and D18 with different fibril widths and lengths were put together to optimize the fibril network of the donor layer. The simultaneously optimization of the acceptor and donor layers resulted in a more ideal double&#8208;fibril network of the photoactive layer and an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;% in LbL&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Bis(Aluminyl)Magnesium: a Source of Nucleophilic or Radical Aluminium&#8208;Centred Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]2 reacts thermally with MeI via nucleophilic attack through Al, consistent with a formal description as an Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic species. Under photolytic activation, reaction with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene leads to the transannular cycloaddition products, consistent with radical chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as an Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) synthon.







Abstract
The homoleptic magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) can be accessed from K2[Al(NON)]2 and MgI2 and shown to possess a non&#8208;linear geometry (&#8736;Al&#8722;Mg&#8722;Al=164.8(1)&#176;) primarily due to the influence of dispersion interactions. This compound acts a four&#8208;electron reservoir in the reductive de&#8208;fluorination of SF6, and reacts thermally with polar substrates such as MeI via nucleophilic attack through aluminium, consistent with the QT&#8208;AIM charges calculated for the metal centres, and a formal description as a Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic. On the other hand, under photolytic activation, the reaction with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene leads to the stereo&#8208;selective generation of transannular cycloaddition products consistent with radical based chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as a Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) synthon. Consistently, photolysis of Mg[Al(NON)]2 in hexane in the absence of COD generates [Al(NON)]2 together with magnesium metal.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homoleptic magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NON=4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene) can be accessed from K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Al(NON)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MgI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and shown to possess a non-linear geometry (&#8736;Al&#8722;Mg&#8722;Al=164.8(1)&#176;) primarily due to the influence of dispersion interactions. This compound acts a four-electron reservoir in the reductive de-fluorination of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and reacts thermally with polar substrates such as MeI via nucleophilic attack through aluminium, consistent with the QT-AIM charges calculated for the metal centres, and a &lt;i&gt;formal&lt;/i&gt; description as a Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic. On the other hand, under photolytic activation, the reaction with 1,5-cyclooctadiene leads to the stereo-selective generation of transannular cycloaddition products consistent with radical based chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as a Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) &lt;i&gt;synthon&lt;/i&gt;. Consistently, photolysis of Mg[Al(NON)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in hexane in the absence of COD generates [Al(NON)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; together with magnesium metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Celiac&#8208;Disease Superantigen Oligomerizes and Increases Permeability in an Enterocyte Cell Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 33&#8208;mer deamidated gliadin peptide is formed in active celiac disease and related to T&#8208;cell activation. We determined its oligomeric nature and found a significant increase in gut epithelial permeability mediated by the tight junction protein zonula occludens&#8208;1. These findings shed light on this pathological peptide and its oligomers and have implications for advancing our understanding and treatment of celiac disease.







Abstract
Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins, affecting approximately 1&#8201;% of the global population. The 33&#8208;mer deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) is a metabolically modified wheat&#8208;gluten superantigen for CeD. Here, we demonstrate that the 33&#8208;mer DGP spontaneously assembles into oligomers with a diameter of approximately 24&#8197;nm. The 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers present two main secondary structural motifs&#8211;a major polyproline II helix and a minor &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. Importantly, in the presence of 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers, there is a statistically significant increase in the permeability in the gut epithelial cell model Caco&#8208;2, accompanied by the redistribution of zonula occludens&#8208;1, a master tight junction protein. These findings provide novel molecular and supramolecular insights into the impact of 33&#8208;mer DGP in CeD and highlight the relevance of gliadin peptide oligomerization.

         <title>In Silico Screening and Experimental Verification of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Two&#8208;Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in silico screening method based on a comprehensive structure generation followed by TD&#8208;DFT calculations was established for developing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Using perylene as a scaffold, a two&#8208;boron&#8208;doping/two&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fusion strategy was applied to provide ca. 2500 possible structures. One of the promising candidates, extracted using several criteria, was synthesized and exhibited intense NIR&#8208;emission.







Abstract
Embedding two boron atoms into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leads to the formation of a neutral analogue that is isoelectronic to the corresponding dicationic PAH skeleton, which can significantly alter its electronic structure. Based on this concept, we explore herein the identification of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive PAHs with the aid of an in silico screening method. Using perylene as the PAH scaffold, we embedded two boron atoms and fused two thiophene rings to it. Based on this design concept, all possible structures (ca. 2500 entities) were generated using a comprehensive structure generator. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations were conducted on all these structures, and promising candidates were extracted based on the vertical excitation energy, transition dipole moment, and atomization energy per bond. One of the extracted dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene candidates was synthesized and indeed exhibited emission at 724&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 0.40 in toluene, demonstrating the validity of this screening method. This modification was further applied to other PAHs, and a series of thienobora&#8208;modified PAHs was synthesized.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of Ketones Using CO2 as a CO Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an electrocatalytic cascade method for synthesizing ketones using CO2 as a CO surrogate. By employing a synergistic combination of two earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts, high yields are achieved in a simple setup, demonstrating the potential for sustainable and efficient carbonylation reactions.







Abstract
The construction of carbonyl compounds via carbonylation reactions using safe CO sources remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to synthetic chemists. Herein, we propose a catalyst cascade Scheme in which CO2 is used as a CO surrogate in the carbonylation of benzyl chlorides. Our approach is based on the cooperation between two coexisting catalytic cycles: the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction cycle promoted by [Fe(TPP)Cl] (TPP=meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin) and an electrochemical carbonylation cycle catalyzed by [Ni(bpy)Br2] (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). As a proof of concept, this protocol allows for the synthesis of symmetric ketones from good to excellent yields in an undivided cell with non&#8208;sacrificial electrodes. The reaction can be directly scaled up to gram&#8208;scale and operates effectively at a CO2 concentration of 10&#8201;%, demonstrating its robustness. Our mechanistic studies based on cyclic voltammetry, IR spectroelectrochemistry and Density Functional Theory calculations suggest a synergistic effect between the two catalysts. The CO produced from CO2 reduction is key in the formation of the [Ni(bpy)(CO)2], which is proposed as the catalytic intermediate responsible for the C&#8722;C bond formation in the carbonylation steps.

         <title>Blocking Interfacial Proton Transport via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, yet suffer from the issues of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and intricate side reactions on the Zn anode surface. The hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond networks play a critical role in interfacial proton transport that may closely relate to HER but are rarely investigated.Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy which is constructed by anchoring ionic liquid cations on Ti3C2Tx substrate for HER&#8208;free Zn anode. Molecule dynamics simulations reveal that the rationally designed SAM with a high coordination number of water molecules (25~27, 4~6 for Zn2+) largely reduces the interfacial densities of H2O molecules, therefore breaking the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and blocking proton transport on the interface, by which the HER is suppressed. Then, a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations demonstrate that negligible amounts of H2 gas are collected from the Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene anode. Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long&#8208;cycling life of 3000 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1000 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high&#8208;capacity retention of over 94% after 1000 cycles and large&#8208;area (10 &#215; 5 cm2) pouch cells with desired performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries(AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydrated hydrogen ions (H3O+) may offer the solution.

Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism.

         <title>Electrochemically Mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Driven by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alternating current (AC) and pulsed electrolysis are gaining traction in electro(organic) synthesis due to their advantageous characteristics. We employed AC electrolysis in electrochemically mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (eATRP) to facilitate the regeneration of the activator CuI complex on Cu0 electrodes. Additionally, Cu0 served as a slow supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA ATRP), enabling the activation of alkyl halides and the regeneration of the CuI activator through a comproportionation reaction. We harnessed the distinct properties of Cu0 dual regeneration, both chemical and electrochemical, by employing sinusoidal, triangular, and square&#8208;wave AC electrolysis alongside some of the most active ATRP catalysts available. Compared to linear waveform (DC electrolysis) or SARA ATRP (without electrolysis), pulsed and AC electrolysis facilitated slightly faster and more controlled polymerizations of acrylates. The same AC electrolysis conditions could successfully polymerize eleven different monomers across different mediums, from water to bulk. Moreover, it proved effective across a spectrum of catalyst activity, from low&#8208;activity Cu/2,2&#8208;bipyridine to highly active Cu complexes with substituted tripodal amine ligands. Chain extension experiments confirmed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of the produced polymers, yielding functional and high molecular&#8208;weight block copolymers. SEM analysis indicated the robustness of the Cu0 electrodes, sustaining at least 15 consecutive polymerizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Crystal and Pentatwinned Gold Nanorods Result in Chiral Nanocrystals with Reverse Handedness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Handedness is an essential attribute of chiral nanocrystals, having a major influence on their properties. During chemical growth, the handedness of nanocrystals is usually tuned by selecting the corresponding enantiomer of chiral molecules involved in asymmetric growth, often known as chiral inducers. We report that, even using the same chiral inducer enantiomer, the handedness of chiral gold nanocrystals can be reversed by using Au nanorod seeds with either single crystalline or pentatwinned structure. This effect holds for chiral growth induced both by amino acids (e.g. cystine) and by chiral micelles (comprising cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and&#160;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;diamine). Although it was challenging to discern the morphological handedness for&#160;L&#8208;cystine&#8208;directed particles, even using electron tomography, both cases showed circular dichroism bands of opposite sign, with nearly mirrored chiroptical signatures for chiral micelle&#8208;directed growth, along with quasi&#8208;helical wrinkles of inverted handedness. These results expand the chiral growth toolbox with an effect&#160;that might be exploited to yield a host of interesting morphologies with tunable optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Like Silicone Nanofilaments@Montmorillonite Nanofillers of PEO&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries with Wide Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising to accelerate commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Nonetheless, this is hindered by the CSEs' limited ion conductivity at room temperature. Here, we propose design, synthesis, and application of the bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers for PEO&#8208;based CSEs. The neuron&#8208;like superhydrophobic nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. Compared to various reported fillers, the nanofillers can greatly improve ionic conductivity (4.9 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, 30 &#176;C), Li+ transference number (0.63), oxidation stability (5.3 V) and mechanical properties of the PEO&#8208;based CSEs because of the following facts. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. Consequently, the assembled SSLMBs with the CSEs and LiFePO4 or NCM811 cathodes display superior cycling stability over a wide temperature range of 50 &#176;C to 0 &#176;C. Surprisingly, the pouch batteries with the large&#8208;scale prepared CSEs kept working after being repeatedly bent, folded, cut or even punched in air. We believe that design of neuron&#8208;like nanofillers is a viable approach to produce CSEs with high room temperature ionic conductivity for SSLMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Sulfoquinovosidase Activity in Cell Lysates Using Activity&#8208;Based Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, constitutes a major sulfur reserve in the biosphere. Microbial breakdown of SQDG is critical for the biological utilization of its sulfur. This commences through release of the parent sugar, sulfoquinovose (SQ), catalyzed by sulfoquinovosidases (SQases). These vanguard enzymes are encoded in gene clusters that code for diverse SQ catabolic pathways. To identify, visualize and isolate glycoside hydrolase CAZY&#8208;family 31 (GH31) SQases in complex biological environments, we introduce SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). These ABPs label the active site nucleophile of this enzyme family, consistent with specific recognition of the SQ cyclophellitol&#8208;aziridine in the active site, as evidenced in the 3D structure of Bacillus megaterium SQase. A fluorescent Cy5&#8208;probe enables visualization of SQases in crude cell lysates from bacteria harbouring different SQ breakdown pathways, whilst a biotin&#8208;probe enables SQase capture and identification by proteomics. The Cy5&#8208;probe facilitates monitoring of active SQase levels during different stages of bacterial growth which show great contrast to more traditional mRNA analysis obtained by RT&#8208;qPCR. Given the importance of SQases in global sulfur cycling and in human microbiota, these SQase ABPs provide a new tool with which to study SQase occurrence, activity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Unconventional Phase Alloy Nanobranches for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one&#8208;pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as&#8208;synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction (NO2RR), with superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2% and 34.6 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 (75.5 mg h&#8208;1 mgIr&#8208;1) at 0 and &#8208;0.1 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8208;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO2RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8211;Cation Competition Chemistry for Comprehensive High&#8208;Performance Prussian Blue Analogs Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After high&#8208;voltage CV scanning, the higher (de)intercalation voltage and lower diffusion activation energy for both Cl&#8722; and K+ boost the comprehensive improvement of the discharge voltage, capacity, rate and cyclic performance. The comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs.







Abstract
The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry (Cl&#8722;, K+, Zn2+) stimulated by high&#8208;voltage scanning. With our designed anion&#8208;cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &gt;2.0&#8197;V (vs. Zn/Zn2+), capacity &gt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96&#8201;% from 0.6 to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000&#8197;cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance PBAs cathode batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion-cation competition chemistry (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) stimulated by high-voltage scanning. With our designed anion-cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &amp;gt;2.0&#8197;V (vs. Zn/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), capacity &amp;gt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96&#8201;% from 0.6 to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000&#8197;cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion-cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next-generation high-performance PBAs cathode batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Dissipative Control of Multimodal Motion in a Silver(I) Catenate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not one, not two, not three, but four! Filling four receptor sites with Ag+ as chemical fuel is the key to the transient and successive self&#8208;assembly of two multicomponent devices. While the first device displays two nanomechanical movements (shuttling and sliding), the second exhibits a sliding motion at increased speed.







Abstract
Stepwise dissipative control of two distinct motions, i.e., shuttling and sliding, is demonstrated in a single multicomponent device. When [2]rotaxane 1, which acts as a biped, and deck 2 were treated with AgBF4/PhCH2Br+NEt3 as chemical fuel, the transient catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ was instantly generated showing multimodal motion and autonomous return to 1 and 2. In the dissipative process, catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ cleanly transformed into the follow&#8208;up transient device (1)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ exhibiting only sliding motion. Two interference&#8208;free dissipative cycles proved the resilience and robustness of the process.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Promoted Activation of N2O, Amine, and H2 as well as Catalytic Hydrogenation of Imines, Quinoline, and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a series of dearomatized calcium pincer complexes. They exhibit high activity toward N2O, secondary amines, and D2(H2), leading to the facile synthesis of calcium diazotate complexes and heterolytic cleavage of N&#8722;H and D&#8722;D(H&#8722;H) bonds by a metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) manner. In addition, hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules was realized, catalyzed by dearomatized calcium pincer complexes.







Abstract
Bond activation and catalysis using s&#8208;block metals are of great significance. Herein, a series of calcium pincer complexes with deprotonated side arms have been prepared using pyridine&#8208;based PNP and PNN ligands. The complexes were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. Utilizing the obtained calcium complexes, unprecedented N2O activation by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) involving dearomatization&#8208;aromatization of the pyridine ligand was achieved, generating aromatized calcium diazotate complexes as products. Additionally, the dearomatized calcium complexes were able to activate the N&#8722;H bond as well as reversibly activate H2, offering an opportunity for the catalytic hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules. DFT calculations were applied to analyze the electronic structures of the synthesized complexes and explore possible reaction mechanisms. This study is an important complement to the area of MLC and main&#8208;group metal chemistry.

         <title>Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of protein templates in artificial enzyme design is illustrated through genetic code expansion. Incorporation of a secondary amine into the nucleotide&#8208;binding DHFR and multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR resulted in catalytic entities, with the former favoring the use of NADPH as the hydride source for reactions, whereas the latter required biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH).







Abstract
Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N&#8208;terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. In this study, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR and nucleotide&#8208;binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D&#8208;proline moiety demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro&#8208;R hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r. up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis. Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR&#8208;based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.

         <title>Fluorinated Polyimide Tunneling Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide was employed as the interface layer between perovskite and hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells. This insulating interface layer facilitates carrier transport via the tunneling effect while effectively passivating defects and providing field&#8208;effect passivation. The optimized devices attained a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.61&#8201;% and demonstrated excellent stability.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), challenges remain in terms of finding effective and viable strategies to enhance their long&#8208;term stability while maintaining high efficiency. In this study, a new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide (FPI: 6FDA&#8208;6FAPB) was used as the interface layer between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs. The functional groups of FPI play a pivotal role in passivating interface defects within the device. Due to its high work function, FPI demonstrates field&#8208;effect passivation (FEP) capabilities as an interface layer, effectively mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Notably, the FPI insulating interface layer does not impede carrier transmission at the interface, which is attributed to the presence of hole tunneling effects. The optimized PSCs achieve an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.61&#8201;% and demonstrate excellent stability, showcasing the efficacy of FPI in enhancing device performance and reliability.

         <title>Aqueous Coordination&#8208;Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water, a poison in traditional olefin polymerization processes using Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, enables coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa) using single&#8208;component and neutral nickel catalysts under mild conditions.







Abstract
Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co&#8208;)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long&#8208;sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers.

     alt="Aqueous Coordination-Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, a poison in traditional olefin polymerization processes using Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, enables coordination-insertion copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high-molecular-weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa) using single-component and neutral nickel catalysts under mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co-)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long-sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination-insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low-molecular-weight polymers. Herein, we develop well-behaved neutral phosphinophenolato nickel catalysts, which enable aqueous copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high-molecular-weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa, 0.13&#8211;1.29&#8197;mol&#8201;%) in a single-component fashion under mild conditions for the first time. These copolymerization reactions occur better in water than in hydrocarbons such as toluene. The dual characteristics of high molecular weight and the incorporation of a small amount of functional group result in improved surface properties while retain the desirable intrinsic properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stiffness Modulation and Pulsatile Release in Dual Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hydrogels that similar to living organisms can maintain or adapt their properties and internal structure upon exposure to a combination of external stimuli. These hydrogels contain both redox and light responsive units, which can operate independently if addressed separately, but show adaptivity and self&#8208;regulation of stiffness when addressed simultaneously.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, self&#8208;regulation can be introduced in synthetic hydrogels by incorporating chemo&#8208;mechanical signals or coupled chemical reactions to maintain or adapt the material's physico&#8208;chemical properties when exposed to external triggers. In this work, we present redox and light dual stimuli responsive hydrogels capable of rapidly adapting the polymer crosslinking network while maintaining hydrogel stability. Upon irradiation with UV light, polymer hydrogels containing redox responsive disulfide crosslinks and light responsive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties show a release of payload accompanied by adaptation of the hydrogel network towards higher stiffness due to in situ crosslinking by S&#8208;nitrosylation. Whereas the hydrogel design allows the network to either become softer in presence of reducing agent glutathione or stiffer upon UV irradiation, simultaneous application of both stimuli induces network self&#8208;regulation resulting in a pulsatile form of payload release from the hydrogel. Finally, adaptive stiffness was used to make tunable hydrogels as substrates for different cell lines.

         <title>Immobilization of Amino&#8208;site into a Pore&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Separation of Propyne/Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2 with densely decorated amino sites and partitioned nanosapces is capable of efficiently producing polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from C3H4&#8208;containing mixtures.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) is a crucial yet complex process, however, it remains a great difficulty in developing porous materials that can meet the requirements for practical applications, particularly with an exceptional ability to bind and store trace amounts of C3H4. Functionalization of pore&#8208;partitioned metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis&#8208;basic (&#8722;NH2) and Lewis&#8208;acidic (&#8722;NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1&#8197;kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4&#8722;C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2&#8208;decorated ppMOF (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2) can efficiently produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 (99.95&#8201;%, 8.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2&#8208;decorated crystal (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NO2). The in situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.

         <title>Distinguish MnO2/Mn2+ Conversion/ Zn2+ Intercalation/ H+ Conversion Chemistries at Different Potentials in Aqueous Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte with an extended electrochemical stability window of approximately 3.0&#8197;V in a water&#8208;rich environment (76&#8197;wt&#8201;%). This widened window enables high&#8208;voltage scanning to initiate the MnO2/Mn2+ redox conversion at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. By employing specific surfactant (e.g., hexadecyl pyridinium chloride monohydrate), the electrolyte potentially segregates Zn2+ and H+ intercalation processes. The tailored amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte facilitates the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V, exclusive Zn2+ intercalation at an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau of approximately 1.33&#8197;V, and H+ intercalation/conversion at plateaus near 1.12&#8197;V.







Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 chemistry has been extensively explored, but its electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in the context of MnO2/Mn2+ conversion and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, remain not fully understood. Here, we designed an amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte, which distinguished the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion, Zn2+ intercalation, and H+ intercalation and conversion processes at three distinct discharge plateaus of an aqueous Zn||MnO2 battery. The amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte is featured with an extended electrochemical stability window up to 3.0&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity, Zn2+&#8208;selective ion tunnels, and hydrophobic associations with cathode materials. This specifically designed electrolyte allows the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. More interesting, the discharge plateaus of ~1.33&#8197;V, previously assigned as the co&#8208;intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ ions in the MnO2 cathode, are specified as the exclusive intercalation of Zn2+ ions, leading to an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau. Furthermore, with a distinct three&#8208;step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high specific energy of 0.858&#8197;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even at a low MnO2 loading mass of 0.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Cyclopropenes as Chemical Reporters for Dual Bioorthogonal and Orthogonal Metabolic Labeling of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual biorthogonal and orthogonal metabolic labeling of genomic DNA in HeLa cells was demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl&#8208;tetrazine dye conjugate and the photoclick reaction with a pyrene&#8208;tetrazole using isomeric cyclopropenes as chemical reporters.







Abstract
Dual bioorthogonal labeling enables the investigation and understanding of interactions in the biological environment that are not accessible by a single label. However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross&#8208;reactivity. We developed a pair of differently modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcyclopropenyl&#8208;modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest&#8208;reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions. Their orthogonal reactivity could be evidenced in vitro. Primer extension experiments were performed with both 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines investigating their replication properties as substitutes for thymidine and evaluating subsequent labeling reactions on the DNA level. Finally, dual, orthogonal and metabolic fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA was demonstrated in HeLa cells. An experimental procedure was developed combining intracellular transport and metabolic DNA incorporation of the two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines with the subsequent dual bioorthogonal labeling using a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl tetrazine and a fluorogenic pyrene&#8208;tetrazole.

     alt="Cyclopropenes as Chemical Reporters for Dual Bioorthogonal and Orthogonal Metabolic Labeling of DNA"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual biorthogonal and orthogonal metabolic labeling of genomic DNA in HeLa cells was demonstrated by combining the inverse-electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a fluorogenic cyanine-styryl-tetrazine dye conjugate and the photoclick reaction with a pyrene-tetrazole using isomeric cyclopropenes as chemical reporters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual bioorthogonal labeling enables the investigation and understanding of interactions in the biological environment that are not accessible by a single label. However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross-reactivity. We developed a pair of differently modified 2&#8242;-deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse-electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1- and 3-methylcyclopropenyl-modified 2&#8242;-deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8242;-deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest-reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions. Their orthogonal reactivity could be evidenced in vitro. Primer extension experiments were performed with both 2&#8242;-deoxyuridines investigating their replication properties as substitutes for thymidine and evaluating subsequent labeling reactions on the DNA level. Finally, dual, orthogonal and metabolic fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA was demonstrated in HeLa cells. An experimental procedure was developed combining intracellular transport and metabolic DNA incorporation of the two 2&#8242;-deoxyuridines with the subsequent dual bioorthogonal labeling using a fluorogenic cyanine-styryl tetrazine and a fluorogenic pyrene-tetrazole. These results are fundamental for advanced metabolic labeling strategies for nucleic acids in the future, especially for live cell experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Spontaneous Electropolymerization Enables Robust Hydrogel Electrolyte Interfaces in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electropolymerization strategy is introduced to form robust hydrogel electrolyte interfaces in aqueous batteries. This approach effectively enhances the interface stability between electrodes and hydrogel, concurrently stabilizing zinc metal anodes and facilitating the charge transfer on the rough cathode.







Abstract
Hydrogels hold great promise as electrolytes for emerging aqueous batteries, for which establishing a robust electrode&#8208;hydrogel interface is crucial for mitigating side reactions. Conventional hydrogel electrolytes fabricated by ex situ polymerization through either thermal stimulation or photo exposure cannot ensure complete interfacial contact with electrodes. Herein, we introduce an in situ electropolymerization approach for constructing hydrogel electrolytes. The hydrogel is spontaneously generated during the initial cycling of the battery, eliminating the need of additional initiators for polymerization. The involvement of electrodes during the hydrogel synthesis yields well&#8208;bonded and deep infiltrated electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. As a case study, we attest that, the in situ&#8208;formed polyanionic hydrogel in Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery substantially improves the stability and kinetics of both Zn anode and porous MnO2 cathode owing to the robust interfaces. This research provides insight to the function of hydrogel electrolyte interfaces and constitutes a critical advancement in designing highly durable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Hydrogels with Differentiated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks for Bioinspired Stress Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deformation of Mimosa, a hydrogel designed by differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks exhibits stress response behavior. In contrast to current artificial materials, it autonomously undergoes reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state deformation/locomotion responses based on a cooperative regulation mechanism. Furthermore, the hydrogel shows significant potential for time&#8208;dependent &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encoding system.







Abstract
Stress response, an intricate and autonomously coordinated reaction in living organisms, holds a reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state nature. However, existing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials often exhibit single&#8208;step and monotonous reactions due to the limited integration of structural components. Inspired by the cooperative interplay of extensor and flexor cells within Mimosa's pulvini, we present a hydrogel with differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) networks designed to enable the biological stress response. Weak H&#8208;bonding domains resemble flexor cells, confined within a hydrophobic network stabilized by strong H&#8208;bonding clusters (acting like extensor cells). Under external force, strong H&#8208;bonding clusters are disrupted, facilitating water diffusion from the bottom layer and enabling transient expansion pressure gradient along the thickness direction. Subsequently, water diffuses upward, gradually equalizing the pressure, while weak H&#8208;bonding domains undergo cooperative elastic deformation. Consequently, the hydrogel autonomously undergoes a sequence of reversible and pluralistic motion responses, similar to Mimosa's touch&#8208;triggered stress response. Intriguingly, it exhibits stress&#8208;dependent color shifts under polarized light, highlighting its potential for applications in time&#8208;sensitive &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption systems. This work achieves the coordinated stress response inspired by natural tissues using a simple hydrogel, paving the way for substantial advancements in the development of intelligent soft robots.

         <title>Differential Substrate Sensing in Terpene Synthases from Plants and Microorganisms: Insight from Structural, Bioinformatic, and EnzyDock Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpene synthases sense their substrates in a binary manner via one of two reactive oxygen atoms. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to these enzymes originating from plants or microorganisms.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) catalyze the first step in the formation of terpenoids, which comprise the largest class of natural products in nature. TPSs employ a family of universal natural substrates, composed of isoprenoid units bound to a diphosphate moiety. The intricate structures generated by TPSs are the result of substrate binding and folding in the active site, enzyme&#8208;controlled carbocation reaction cascades, and final reaction quenching. A key unaddressed question in class I TPSs is the asymmetric nature of the diphosphate&#8208;(Mg2+)3 cluster, which forms a critical part of the active site. In this asymmetric ion cluster, two diphosphate oxygen atoms protrude into the active site pocket. The substrate hydrocarbon tail, which is eventually molded into terpenes, can bind to either of these oxygen atoms, yet to which is unknown. Herein, we employ structural, bioinformatics, and EnzyDock docking tools to address this enigma. We bring initial data suggesting that this difference is rooted in evolutionary differences between TPSs. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to TPSs originating from plants or microorganisms. We further suggest that this difference can cast light on the frequent observation that the chiral products or intermediates of plant and bacterial terpene synthases represent opposite enantiomers.

         <title>Theoretical Prediction Leads to Synthesize GDY Supported InOx Quantum Dots for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The target catalysts with high activity and selectivity towards CO2RR were predicted by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using GDY supported QDs as the ideal model, which presents an effective strategy for rational design of new heterostructure electrocatalysts to achieve highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.







Abstract
The preparation of formic acid by direct reduction of carbon dioxide is an important basis for the future chemical industry and is of great significance. Due to the serious shortage of highly active and selective electrocatalysts leading to the development of direct reduction of carbon dioxide is limited. Herein the target catalysts with high CO2RR activity and selectivity were identified by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using graphdiyne (GDY) supported metal oxides quantum dots (QDs) as the ideal model. It is theoretically predicted that GDY supported indium oxide QDs (i.e., InOx/GDY) is a new heterostructure electrocatalyst candidate with optimal CO2RR performance. The interfacial electronic strong interactions effectively regulate the surface charge distribution of QDs and affect the adsorption/desorption behavior of HCOO* intermediate during CO2RR to achieve highly efficient CO2 conversion. Based on the predicted composition and structure, we synthesized the advanced catalytic system, and demonstrates superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion performance. The study presents an effective strategy for rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts to promote green chemical production.

         <title>Final Stages in the Biosynthesis of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Active Site</title>

Text for TOC The final stages of the biosynthesis of the [FeFe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases are elucidated by a combination of organometallic synthesis and biophysical analysis. The complex [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; containing the unprecedented aminomethylthiolate ligand, allows maturation of HydA1 in the presence of HydF and the established cocktail of reagents and proteins. The same complex maturates HydA1 using a simplified protein&#8208;free recipe.







Abstract
The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The recently hypothesized intermediate [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; ([1]2&#8722;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe2(S2)(CN)(CO)5]&#8722;. The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CNBEt3)(CO)5]&#8722;, [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)&#8722;(CO)5]&#8722;, and [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722;, where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]+, PPh4+ and PPN+ salts as well as the 13CD2&#8208;isotopologues. These Fe2 species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial&#8208;equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur. In vitro experiments demonstrate that [1]2&#8722; maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.

Benefitting from the the design idea of &#8220;Carrier&#8208;Catalytic&#8221; integration mechanism, the C&#8722;Br bond of thiophene and C&#8722;F bond of TFSI&#8722; are easier to break due to the special electron transfer characteristic of thiophene skeleton in porous organic framework, the in situ co&#8208;growth LiF&#8208;LiBr rich SEI was finally constructed at Li/SPE interface through &#8220;surgical&#8221; targeted therapy, which ensures that the full cells paired with LFP cathode present excellent performances over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. In addition, the pouch cells paired with LFP cathode present excellent performances over 550&#8197;cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 88&#8201;%.







Abstract
The generation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) largely determines the comprehensive performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, a novel &#8220;carrier&#8208;catalytic&#8221; integrated design is strategically exploited to in situ construct a stable LiF&#8208;LiBr rich SEI by improving the electron transfer kinetics to accelerate the bond&#8208;breaking dynamics. Specifically, the high electron transport capacity of Br&#8208;TPOM skeleton increases the polarity of C&#8722;Br, thus promoting the generation of LiBr. Then, the enhancement of electron transfer kinetics further promotes the fracture of C&#8722;F from TFSI&#8722; to form LiF. Finally, the stable and homogeneous artificial&#8208;SEI with enriched lithium dihalide is constructed through the in situ co&#8208;growth mechanism of LiF and LiBr, which facilitatse the Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics and regulates the lithium deposition behavior. Impressively, the PEO&#8208;Br&#8208;TPOM paired with LiFePO4 delivers ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles with 81&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C while the pouch cells possess 88&#8201;% superior capacity retention after 550&#8197;cycles with initial discharge capacity of 145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1at 0.2&#8197;C in the absence of external pressure. Even under stringent conditions, the practical pouch cells possess the practical capacity with stable electric quantities plateau in 30&#8197;cycles demonstrates its application potential in energy storage field.

         <title>Bending, Twisting, and Propulsion of Photoreactive Crystals by Controlled Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in liquid media and excited by light.







Abstract
The rapid release of gas by a chemical reaction to generate momentum is one of the most fundamental ways to elicit motion that could be used to sustain and control the motility of objects. We report that hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in mother solution. In needle&#8208;like regular crystals, the reaction occurs mainly on the surface and results in the formation of cracks that evolve due to internal pressure; the expansion on the cracked surface of the crystal results in bending, twisting, or coiling of the crystal. In hollow crystals, gas accumulates inside their cavities and emanates preferentially from the recess at the crystal terminus, propelling the crystals to undergo directional photomechanical motion through the mother solution. The motility of the object which can be controlled externally to perform work delineates the concept of &#8220;crystal microbots&#8221;, realized by photoreactive organic crystals capable of prolonged directional motion for actuation or delivery. Within the prospects, we envisage the development of a plethora of light&#8208;weight, efficient, autonomously operating robots based on organic crystals with high work capacity where motion over large distances can be attained due to the large volume of latent gas generated from a small volume of the crystalline solid.

         <title>Homochiral &#960;&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled Chirality Imprinting in Conjugated Polymers: Confined Polymerization and Chiral Memory from Scratch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) were synthesized through confined polymerization within &#960;&#8208;rich homochiral covalent organic frameworks, utilizing a chiral imprinting process. The isolated OACPs retained chirality and displayed robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids.







Abstract
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) have garnered increasing research interest for their resemblance to biological helices and intriguing chirality&#8208;related functions. Traditional methods for synthesizing involve decorating achiral conjugated polymer architectures with enantiopure side substituents through complex organic synthesis. Here, we report a new approach: the templated synthesis of unsubstituted OACPs via supramolecularly confined polymerizations of achiral monomers within nanopores of 2D or 3D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs). We show that the chiral &#960;&#8208;rich nanospaces facilitate the in situ enantiospecific polymerization and self&#8208;propagation, akin to nonenzymatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, resulting in chiral imprinting. The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200&#8201;&#176;C. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.

Introducing trifluoromethyl group to boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes improves both their electron&#8208;accepting ability and solubility. Owing to their bulky structures and excellent light&#8208;absorption ability, bright NIR&#8208;II fluorescence is observed from polymer solutions, films, and nanoparticles.







Abstract
Luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1,000&#8211;1,700&#8197;nm) window is beneficial especially for deep tissue imaging and optical sensors because of intrinsic high permeability through various media. Strong electron&#8208;acceptors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are a crucial unit for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) with the NIR&#8208;II emission property, however, limited kinds of molecular skeletons are still available. Herein, D&#8211;A CPs involving fluorinated boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes (BAz) with enhanced electron&#8208;accepting properties are reported. Combination of fluorination at the azobenzene ligand and trifluoromethylation at the boron can effectively lower the LUMO energy level down to &#8722;4.42&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of conventional strong electron&#8208;acceptors. The synthesized series of CPs showed excellent absorption/fluorescence property in solution over a wide NIR range including NIR&#8208;II. Furthermore, owing to the inherent solid&#8208;state emissive property of the BAz skeleton, obvious NIR&#8208;II fluorescence from the film (up to &#955;FL=1213&#8197;nm) and the nanoparticle in water (&#955;FL=1036&#8197;nm, brightness=up to 29&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;M&#8722;1) were observed, proposing that our materials are applicable for developing next&#8208;generation of NIR&#8208;II luminescent materials.

         <title>Precision Engineering of the Co&#8208;immobilization of Enzymes for Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;layered coating approach was developed for the precise and sequential immobilization of dual&#8208;enzyme systems on resin particles using two biorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition. The method enables the combined purification and the ordered immobilization of enzymes and significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency and recyclability of multienzyme systems.







Abstract
The design and orderly layered co&#8208;immobilization of multiple enzymes on resin particles remain challenging. In this study, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher binding pair was fused to the N&#8208;terminus of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldo&#8208;keto reductase (AKR), respectively. A non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA), p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (p&#8208;AzF), as the anchor for covalent bonding enzymes, was genetically inserted into preselected sites in the AKR and ADH. Employing the two bioorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition for the immobilization of AKR and ADH enabled sequential dual&#8208;enzyme coating on porous microspheres. The ordered dual&#8208;enzyme reactor was subsequently used to synthesize (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanol asymmetrically from the corresponding prochiral ketone, enabling the in situ regeneration of NADPH. The reactor exhibited a high catalytic conversion of 74&#8201;% and good reproducibility, retaining 80&#8201;% of its initial activity after six cycles. The product had 99.9&#8201;% ee, which that was maintained in each cycle. Additionally, the double&#8208;layer immobilization method significantly increased the enzyme loading capacity, which was approximately 1.7&#8197;times greater than that of traditional single&#8208;layer immobilization. More importantly, it simultaneously enabled both the purification and immobilization of multiple enzymes on carriers, thus providing a convenient approach to facilitate cascade biocatalysis.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Modified RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the field of chemical RNA synthesis are discussed, starting with protection concepts, followed by selected nucleoside modifications that are challenging to incorporate into RNA. Comments on the chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs, the enzymatic ligation of synthetic RNA, and RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modifications using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functional groups complete this minireview.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play a vital role in living organisms. Many of their cellular functions depend critically on chemical modification. Methods to modify RNA in a controlled manner&#8212;both in vitro and in vivo&#8212;are thus essential to evaluate and understand RNA biology at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site&#8208;specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid&#8208;phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, N4&#8208;acetylcytidine, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytidine, 3&#8208;methylcytidine, 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3, and 2&#8242;&#8208;N3 ribose modifications. We also discuss the all&#8208;chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single&#8208;molecule FRET studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.

         <title>A Stoichiometric Haloform Coupling for Ester Synthesis with Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general haloform coupling reaction for the synthesis of esters from methyl ketones is reported using one equivalent of alcohol. Detailed kinetic modelling studies demonstrate that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which led to the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.

Abstract
The haloform reaction from methyl ketones to carboxylic acids is one of the oldest known synthetic organic reactions, which has been used in myriad applications over the decades. The corresponding reaction to produce esters is, however, less developed, as the reaction is generally limited to simple, primary alcohols that are used in solvent&#8208;level quantities, thereby restricting the complexity of esters that can be directly formed. Herein, we detail the development of a general ester&#8208;forming haloform coupling reaction using one equivalent of alcohol. Mechanistic and kinetic modelling studies demonstrated that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which facilitated the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.

Exploring New Paths for Solar Energy Storage: A Win&#8208;Win Approach for rGO/CdS to Improve the Energy Conversion Efficiency and Stability of Integrated Photorechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries.







Abstract
Integrating solar energy into rechargeable battery systems represents a significant advancement towards sustainable energy storage solutions. Herein, we propose a win&#8208;win solution to reduce the shuttle effect of polysulfide and improve the photocorrosion stability of CdS, thereby enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of rGO/CdS&#8208;based photorechargeable integrated lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PRLSBs). Experimental results show that CdS can effectively anchor polysulfide under sunlight irradiation for 20&#8197;minutes. Under a high current density (1&#8197;C), the discharge&#8208;specific capacity of the PRLSBs increased to 971.30&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 113.3&#8201;% enhancement compared to that of under dark condition (857.49&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Remarkably, without an electrical power supply, the PRLSBs can maintain a 21&#8197;hours discharge process following merely 1.5&#8197;hours of light irradiation, achieving a breakthrough solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion efficiency of up to 5.04&#8201;%. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman analysis corroborate the effectiveness of this complementary weakness approach in bolstering redox kinetics and curtailing polysulfide dissolution in PRLSBs. This work showcases a feasible strategy to develop PRLSBs with potential dual&#8208;functional metal sulfide photoelectrodes, which will be of great interest in future&#8208;oriented off&#8208;grid photocell systems.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Water in Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of Methanol Conversion for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol and the desorption of liquid products from photocatalytic methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, which leads to a nearly linear increase of the H2 production with the reduction of water content in methanol aqueous solution.







Abstract
Water molecules, which act as both solvent and reactant, play critical roles in photocatalytic reactions for methanol conversion. However, the influence of water on the adsorption of methanol and desorption of liquid products, which are two essential steps that control the performance in photocatalysis, has been well under&#8208;explored. Herein, we reveal the role of water in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes of methanol conversion on the platinized carbon nitride (Pt/C3N4) model photocatalyst. In situ spectroscopy techniques, isotope effects, and computational calculations demonstrate that water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol molecules and desorption processes of methanol oxidation products on the surface of Pt/C3N4, significantly altering the reaction pathways in photocatalytic methanol conversion process. Guided by these discoveries, a photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system is designed to achieve a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 2.3&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported. This work highlights the important roles of solvents in controlling the adsorption/desorption behaviours of liquid&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Stereodivergent, Kinetically Controlled Isomerization of Terminal Alkenes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic alkene mono&#8208;transposition generates E&#8208; or Z&#8208;olefins depending on the steric properties and denticity of the ligand employed. Mechanistic studies reveal that the aryl iodide additive acts as a redox buffer for nickel in the Z&#8208;selective reaction, generating the most&#8208;selective NiII&#8211;H that outcompetes a less Z&#8208;selective NiI&#8211;H species. For the E&#8208;selective reaction, the phosphonium salt plays a dual role as an acid and ligand, forming a phosphine&#8208;bound cationic Ni&#8722;H catalyst in situ.







Abstract
Because internal alkenes are more challenging synthetic targets than terminal alkenes, metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin mono&#8208;transposition (i.e., positional isomerization) approaches have emerged to afford valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208; internal alkenes from their complementary terminal alkene feedstocks. However, the applicability of these methods has been hampered by lack of generality, commercial availability of precatalysts, and scalability. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed platform for the stereodivergent E/Z&#8208;selective synthesis of internal alkenes at room temperature. Commercial reagents enable this one&#8208;carbon transposition of terminal alkenes to valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208;internal alkenes via a Ni&#8722;H&#8208;mediated insertion/elimination mechanism. Though the mechanistic regime is the same in both systems, the underlying pathways that lead to each of the active catalysts are distinct, with the Z&#8208;selective catalyst forming from comproportionation of an oxidative addition complex followed by oxidative addition with substrate and the E&#8208;selective catalyst forming from protonation of the metal by the trialkylphosphonium salt additive. In each case, ligand sterics and denticity control stereochemistry and prevent over&#8208;isomerization.

         <title>Dithienoquinoxalineimide&#8208;Based Polymer Donor Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

We developed a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor QQ1 via introducing a dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) A unit. The binary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT and ternary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8201;:&#8201;F&#8208;BTA3 all&#8208;PSCs present high PCEs of 18.81&#8201;% and 19.20&#8201;% respectively, benefiting from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications owing to their outstanding advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and stable film morphology. However, compared to large amount of new&#8208;emerging excellent polymer acceptors, the development of high&#8208;performance polymer donor lags behind. Herein, a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor, namely QQ1, was developed based on dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) as the A unit, benzodithiophene with thiophene&#8208;conjugated side chains (BDTT) as the D unit, and alkyl&#8208;thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridge, respectively. QQ1 not only possesses a strong dipole moment, but also shows a wide band gap of 1.80&#8197;eV and a deep HOMO energy level of &#8722;5.47&#8197;eV, even without halogen substituents that are commonly indispensable for high&#8208;performance polymer donors. When blended with a classic polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, the QQ1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC delivers an outstanding PCE of 18.81&#8201;%. After the introduction of F&#8208;BTA3 as the third component, a record PCE of 19.20&#8201;% was obtained, the highest value reported so far for all&#8208;PSCs. The impressive photovoltaic performance originates from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.
