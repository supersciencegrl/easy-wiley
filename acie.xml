         <title>Diazapentabenzocorannulenium: A Hydrophilic/Biophilic Cationic Buckybowl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic molecules are promising functional materials for a wide range of applications, especially in organic electronics. However, their largely hydrophobic nature has impeded further applications. As such, imparting high solubility/hydrophilicity to polycyclic aromatic molecules leads to breakthrough in this research field. Herein, we report the synthesis of diazapentabenzocorannulenium, a cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded buckybowl bearing a central imidazolium core, by a bottom&#8208;up strategy from polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide. X&#8208;ray crystallography analyses have revealed a bowl&#8208;shape molecular structure that is capable of forming charge&#8208;segregated one&#8208;dimensional columns by bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl packing. In addition to its fluorescence capabilities and high dispersibility in water, the molecule was found to selectively localize in the mitochondria of various tumor cells, showing potential as viable mitochondria&#8208;selective fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Alkylation of Alkenyl Acetates with Alkyl Bromides by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic alkylation of stable alkenyl C&#8722;O electrophiles is synthetically appealing, but studies to date have typically focused on the reactions with alkyl Grignard reagents. We here report a cross&#8208;electrophile reaction of alkenyl acetates with alkyl bromides. This work has enabled a new method for the synthesis of aliphatic alkenes from alkenyl acetates to be established that can be used to add more structural complexity and molecular diversity with enhanced functionality tolerance. The method allows for a gram&#8208;scale reaction and modification of biologically active molecules, and it affords access to useful building blocks. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the Ni(I) species plays an essential role for the success of the coupling of these two reactivity&#8208;mismatched electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Supramolecular Polymer Constituted of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the creation of next&#8208;generation organic electronic materials, the integration of &#960;&#8208;systems has recently become a central theme. Such functional materials can be assembled by supramolecular polymerization when aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems are used as monomers, and the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymer strongly depend on the electronic structure of the monomers. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a supramolecular polymer consisting of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer. An amide&#8208;functionalized Ni(II) norcorrole derivative formed a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, ensuring the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation, which results in higher charge mobility along the tightly bound linear aggregates than that of the aromatic analogue composed of Zn(II) porphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Ligation&#8208;Activated Fluorogenic FRET Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An energy transfer&#8208;based signal amplification relay concept enabling transmission of bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable coumarins to yellow/red emitting cyanine frames is presented. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved cyanine fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts allowing lower background fluorescence even in no&#8208;wash bioorthogonal fluorogenic labeling schemes of intracellular structures in live cells. These energy transfer dyads sharing the same donor moiety together with their parent donor molecule allowed three&#8208;color imaging of intracellular targets using one single excitation source with separate emission windows. Sub&#8208;diffraction imaging of intracellular structures using the present&#8208;ed bioorthogonally activatable FRET dyads by STED microscopy is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Independent Molecular Weight Determination of Polymers Based on a Truly Universal Calibration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows for accurate molecular weight calibration and determination that can be corrected for solvent influences. Polystyrene and poly(ethylene glycol) standards have been used to calibrate DOSY diffusion data for a variety of solvents, showing a high correlation of data when the bulk viscosity of the solvent is accounted for following the Stokes&#8208;Einstein equation. In this way, a type of universal calibration is introduced that allows for determinations of average molecular weight that are at least as accurate as those of traditional size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), if not better. Further, we demonstrate that DOSY calibrations can be used between laboratories, hence removing the need for individual calibration of setups as currently done.</dc:description>

         <title>Crosslinked polypeptide films via RAFT mediated continuous assembly of polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polypeptide coatings are a cornerstone in the field of surface modification due to their widespread biological potential. As their properties are dictated by their structural features, subsequent control thereof using unique fabrication strategies is important. Herein, we report a facile method of precisely creating densely crosslinked polypeptide films with unusually high random coil conformations through continuous assembly polymerization  via  reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (CAP&#8208;RAFT). CAP&#8208;RAFT was fundamentally investigated using methacrylated poly&#8208;  L  &#8208;lysine (PLLMA) and methacrylated poly&#8208;  L  &#8208;glutamic acid (PLGMA). Careful technique refinement resulted in films up to 36.1 &#177; 1.1 nm thick which could be increased to 94.9 &#177; 8.2 nm after using this strategy multiple times. PLLMA and PLGMA films were found to have 30&#8208;50% random coil conformations. Degradation by enzymes present during wound healing reveals potential for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinone Covalent Organic Framework Hollow Tubes as Binder Microadditives in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks could have implications as microadditives of binders (&#8776;1&#8197;wt&#8201;% in cathode) and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives to obtain a high&#8208;performance binder in Li&#8722;S batteries.

The exploration of new application forms of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in Li&#8722;S batteries that can overcome drawbacks like low conductivity or high loading when typically applied as sulfur host materials (mostly &#8776;20 to &#8776;40&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading in cathode) is desirable to maximize their low&#8208;density advantage to obtain lightweight, portable, or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices. Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as microadditives of binders (&#8776;1&#8197;wt&#8201;% in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives. The microadditives can strengthen the basic properties of the binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium polysulfides, as proved by density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode.

         <title>An Unsymmetrical, Cyclic Diborene Based on a Chelating CAAC Ligand and its Small&#8208;Molecule Activation and Rearrangement Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doubly CAAC&#8208;supported unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was obtained via an in situ, one&#8208;pot synthesis protocol. This diborene features a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. The reactivity of this diborene with small molecules, including [AuCl(PCy3)], durylborane, white phosphorus (P4) and terminal alkynes, as well as the thermal rearrangement chemistry, were investigated.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of a CAAC&#8208;stabilized, unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was achieved via consecutive two&#8208;electron reduction steps from an adduct of CAAC and B2Br4(SMe2)2. Theoretical studies revealed that this diborene has a considerably smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than those of reported NHC&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;supported diborenes. Complexation of the diborene with [AuCl(PCy3)] afforded two diborene&#8211;AuI &#960;&#8197;complexes, while reaction with DurBH2, P4 and a terminal acetylene led to the cleavage of B&#8722;H, P&#8722;P, and C&#8722;C &#960;&#8197;bonds, respectively. Thermal rearrangement of the diborene gave an electron&#8208;rich cyclic alkylideneborane, which readily coordinated to AgI via its B=C double bond.

         <title>Condensed Supramolecular Helices: The Twisted Sisters of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bile salt biosurfactant with low molecular weight can self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular helices by interaction with oppositely charged polymers. A controlled condensation of the supramolecular helices into DNA&#8208;like hexagonally packed bundles and toroids can be achieved when using block copolymers of opposite charge and increasing the bile salt content.







Abstract
Condensation of DNA helices into hexagonally packed bundles and toroids represents an intriguing example of functional organization of biological macromolecules at the nanoscale. The condensation models are based on the unique polyelectrolyte features of DNA, however here we could reproduce a DNA&#8208;like condensation with supramolecular helices of small chiral molecules, thereby demonstrating that it is a more general phenomenon. We show that the bile salt sodium deoxycholate can form supramolecular helices upon interaction with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of homopolymer or block copolymers. At higher order, a controlled hexagonal packing of the helices into DNA&#8208;like bundles and toroids could be accomplished. The results disclose unknown similarities between covalent and supramolecular non&#8208;covalent helical polyelectrolytes, which inspire visionary ideas of constructing supramolecular versions of biological macromolecules. As drug nanocarriers the polymer&#8211;bile salt superstructures would get advantage of a complex chirality at molecular and supramolecular levels, whose effect on the nanocarrier assisted drug efficiency is a still unexplored fascinating issue.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Friedel&#8211;Crafts Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of the inherent strain energy of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts inspired synthesis of a unique library of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles is described. The observed dearomatized intermediate of this reaction can be converted to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation or trapped as the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct to generate complex sp3&#8208;rich architectures.







Abstract
The identification of spiro N&#8208;heterocycles as scaffolds that display structural novelty, three&#8208;dimensionality, beneficial physicochemical properties, and enable the controlled spatial disposition of substituents has led to a surge of interest in utilizing these compounds in drug discovery programs. Herein, we report the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven Friedel&#8211;Crafts spirocyclization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;tethered (hetero)aryls for the synthesis of a unique library of azetidine spiro&#8208;tetralins. The reaction was discovered to proceed through an unexpected interrupted Friedel&#8211;Crafts mechanism, generating a highly complex azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold. This dearomatized intermediate, formed exclusively as a single diastereomer, can be subsequently converted to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation of the tertiary amine, or trapped as a Diels&#8211;Alder adduct in one&#8208;pot. The rapid assembly of molecular complexity demonstrated in these reactions highlights the potential of the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven spirocyclization strategy to be utilized in the synthesis of medicinally relevant scaffolds.

         <title>Continuous Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes with Modifiable Sites for Optimized Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with stable carbon&#8211;carbon linkages and chemically modifiable pores were shaped into continuous membranes, which are capable of separating industrially valuable gas mixtures, including H2/N2 and CO2/N2. With modulation of the pore structure or chemical environment, the separation performance of continuous PAF membranes exceeded their corresponding Robeson's upper bounds.







Abstract
Continuous microporous membranes are widely studied for gas separation, due to their low energy premium and strong molecular specificity. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with their exceptional stability and structural flexibility are suited to a wide range of separations. Main&#8208;stream PAF&#8208;based membranes are usually prepared with polymeric matrices, but their discrete entities and boundary defects weaken their selectivity and permeability. The synthesis of continuous PAF membranes is still a major challenge because PAFs are insoluble. Herein, we successfully synthesized a continuous PAF membrane for gas separation. Both pore size and chemistry of the PAF membrane were modified by ion&#8208;exchange, resulting in good selectivity and permeance for the gas mixtures H2/N2 and CO2/N2. The membrane with Br&#8722; as a counter ion in the framework exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 72.7 with a H2 permeance of 51844 gas permeation units (GPU). When the counter ions were replaced by BF4&#8722;, the membrane showed a CO2 permeance of 23058&#8197;GPU, and an optimized CO2/N2 selectivity of 60.0. Our results show that continuous PAF membranes with modifiable pores are promising for various gas separation situations.

         <title>Multiplexed Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Ligand Binding Assays by Affinity Labeling and DNA Sequence Analysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;barcoded ligands to target proteins allows ligand&#8208;binding assays using DNA as a label. Pooled sample manipulation and DNA sequence detection enabled by DNA encoding yields quantitative binding assays amenable to both ligand displacement and direct binding formats.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule binding assays to target proteins are a core component of drug discovery and development. While a number of assay formats are available, significant drawbacks still remain in cost, sensitivity, and throughput. To improve assays by capitalizing on the power of DNA sequence analysis, we have developed an assay method that combines DNA encoding with split&#8208;and&#8208;pool sample handling. The approach involves affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;linked ligands to a protein target. Critically, the labeling event assesses ligand binding and enables subsequent pooling of several samples. Application of a purifying selection on the pool for protein&#8208;labeled DNAs allows detection of ligand binding by quantification of DNA barcodes. We demonstrate the approach in both ligand displacement and direct binding formats and demonstrate its utility in determination of relative ligand affinity, profiling ligand specificity, and high&#8208;throughput small&#8208;molecule screening.

         <title>Ammonium Pertechnetate in Mixtures of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Acid and Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium pertechnetate is reduced to a green technetium(V) complex when left in triflic acid, while yellow pertechnetyl triflate and a purple TcVI species form as intermediates. In the presence of excess pertechnetate, the ammonium salt of a pertechnetato&#8211;oxotechnetate, can be isolated.







Abstract
Ammonium pertechnetate reacts in mixtures of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid under final formation of ammonium pentakis(trifluoromethanesulfonato)oxidotechnetate(V), (NH4)2[TcO(OTf)5]. The reaction proceeds only at exact concentrations and under the exclusion of air and moisture via pertechnetyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, [TcO3(OTf)], and intermediate TcVI species. 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been used to study the TcVII compound and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 99Tc&#8197;NMR and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) experiments indicate the presence of the reduced technetium species. In moist air, (NH4)2[TcO(OTf)5] slowly hydrolyses under formation of the tetrameric oxidotechnetate(V) (NH4)4[{TcO(TcO4)4}4] &#8901;10&#8201;H2O. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to determine the solid&#8208;state structures. Additionally, UV/Vis absorption and IR spectra as well as quantum chemical calculations confirm the identity of the species.

         <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Targeted DNA Crosslinking with cis&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Modified Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid click chemistry has been used for the development of cis&#8208;platinum(II)/triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide hybrid biomaterials. This modular approach allows the incorporation of cis&#8208;platinum(II) at practically any location within the probe strand. These hybrid biomaterials display discrete and efficient crosslinking of purine&#8208;rich genetic elements of the GFP gene.







Abstract
Limitations of clinical platinum(II) therapeutics include systemic toxicity and inherent resistance. Modern approaches, therefore, seek new ways to deliver active platinum(II) to discrete nucleic acid targets. In the field of antigene therapy, triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) have attracted interest for their ability to specifically recognise extended duplex DNA targets. Here, we report a click chemistry based approach that combines alkyne&#8208;modified TFOs with azide&#8208;bearing cis&#8208;platinum(II) complexes&#8212;based on cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin motifs&#8212;to generate a library of PtII&#8208;TFO hybrids. These constructs can be assembled modularly and enable directed platinum(II) crosslinking to purine nucleobases on the target sequence under the guidance of the TFO. By covalently incorporating modifications of thiazole orange&#8212;a known DNA&#8208;intercalating fluorophore&#8212;into PtII&#8208;TFOs constructs, enhanced target binding and discrimination between target and off&#8208;target sequences was achieved.

         <title>A Modular Access to 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutylboronic Esters by Consecutive Radical Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the strain inherent in a cyclobutyl ring to counteract the stabilization of a radical adjacent to a boronic ester allows the synthesis a broad variety of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters.







Abstract
A modular approach to substituted cyclobutylboronic esters is described. It proceeds by successive intermolecular radical additions of xanthates to pinacolato 1&#8208;cyclobutenylboronate and to pinacolato bicyclo[1.1.0]but&#8208;1&#8208;ylboronate. Success hinges on tuning the stability of the &#945;&#8208;boryl radical by exploiting the stabilizing influence of the trivalent boronic ester and the slightly destabilizing cyclobutane, which increases the &#963;&#8208;character of the radical. Reductive removal of the xanthate group finally provides a range of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters. The contrast with cyclopropylboronic esters is striking, since the strong destabilization by the highly strained cyclopropane ring allows the first radical addition to take place but not the second. Furthermore, the first adducts are geminal xanthyl boronic esters that can be converted into cyclobutanones. This chemistry furnishes cyclobutylboronic esters that would be quite difficult to obtain otherwise and thus complements existing methods.

         <title>Orchestrating Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide Signaling Molecules for Synergistic Treatment of MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the coexistence and interplay of gaseous signaling molecules in truly physiological and pathological conditions, photoresponsive micelles capable of simultaneously releasing nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been developed by covalent grafting of NO&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine onto CO&#8208;releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone moieties, showing a synergistic antimicrobial activity toward MRSA both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The local delivery of gaseous signaling molecules (GSMs) has shown promising therapeutic potential. However, although GSMs have a subtle interplay in physiological and pathological conditions, the co&#8208;delivery of different GSMs for therapeutic purposes remains unexplored. Herein, we covalently graft a nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moiety onto the carbon monoxide (CO)&#8208;releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (3&#8208;HF) antenna, resulting in the first NO/CO&#8208;releasing donor. Under visible light irradiation, photo&#8208;mediated co&#8208;release of NO and CO reveals a superior antimicrobial effect toward Gram&#8208;positive bacteria with a combination index of 0.053. The synergy of NO and CO hyperpolarizes and permeabilizes bacterial membranes, which, however, shows negligible hemolysis and no evident toxicity toward normal mammalian cells. Moreover, the co&#8208;release of NO and CO can efficiently treat MRSA infection in a murine skin wound model, showing a better therapeutic capacity than vancomycin.

         <title>Palladium/Ferrierite versus Palladium/SSZ&#8208;13 Passive NOx Adsorbers: Adsorbate&#8208;Controlled Location of Atomically Dispersed Palladium(II) in Ferrierite Determines High Activity and Stability**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Palladium ions in ferrierite zeolite (present majorly as PdII&#8208;OH/1Al sites after 550&#8201;&#176;C air calcination) re&#8208;disperse after air calcination at 800&#8201;&#176;C as predominantly PdII/2Al sites for 1.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pd/H&#8208;FER with a Si/Al ratio of 10:1. The resulting material shows excellent nitric oxide adsorption properties as well as high hydrothermal stability up to 800&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;loaded FER and SSZ&#8208;13 zeolites as low&#8208;temperature passive NOx adsorbers (PNA) are compared under practical conditions. Vehicle cold start exposes the material to CO under a range of concentrations, necessitating a systematic exploration of the effect of CO on the performance of isolated Pd ions in PNA. The NO release temperature of both adsorbers decreases gradually with an increase in CO concentration from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm. This beneficial effect results from local nano&#8208;&#8220;hot spot&#8221; formation during CO oxidation. Dissimilar to Pd/SSZ&#8208;13, increasing the CO concentration above &#8776;1000&#8197;ppm improves the NOx storage significantly for Pd/FER, which was attributed to the presence of Pd ions in FER sites that are shielded from NOx. CO mobilizes this Pd atom to the NOx accessible position where it becomes active for PNA. This behavior explains the very high resistance of Pd/FER to hydrothermal aging: Pd/FER materials survive hydrothermal aging at 800&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8201;% H2O vapor for 16&#8197;hours with no deterioration in NOx uptake/release behavior. Thus, by allocating Pd ions to the specific microporous pockets in FER, we have produced (hydro)thermally stable and active PNA materials.

         <title>Precatalyst&#8208;Enabled Selectivity: Enantioselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Hydrometalative Cyclization of Alkynones to Endo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;cyclic Allylic Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented NiH&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and anti&#8208;selective intramolecular coupling of alkynones to construct O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;containing endocyclic allylic alcohols was developed. The choice of metal precursors plays a key role in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. This study offers a new anti&#8208;hydrocyclization mode for enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyclization of alkynones with unparalleled anti&#8208; and endocyclic selectivities is described. The choice of the precatalysts has significant influence in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Using Ni(OTs)2/Phox as a precatalyst and (EtO)2MeSiH as a hydride source, an array of enantioenriched O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing heterocyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are obtained in 24&#8211;81&#8201;% yields with 80:20&#8211;99:1 er. Mechanistic investigations and synthetic application are also carried out. This study represents an efficient access to a set of allylic alcohols that are unable to access by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coupling reactions.

         <title>DNA Aptamer&#8211;Cyanine Complexes as Generic Colorimetric Small&#8208;Molecule Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational strategy is introduced to develop label&#8208;free colorimetric assays based on aptamers and cyanine dyes that can detect small molecules for on&#8208;site sensing applications. This dye&#8208;displacement approach is found to be generally applicable to DNA aptamers with diverse sequences, structures, and affinity, enabling the detection of a variety of analytes in a sensitive, selective, and rapid manner.







Abstract
Aptamers are promising biorecognition elements for sensors. However, aptamer&#8208;based assays often lack the requisite levels of sensitivity and/or selectivity because they typically employ structure&#8208;switching aptamers with attenuated affinity and/or utilize reporters that require aptamer labeling or which are susceptible to false positives. Dye&#8208;displacement assays offer a label&#8208;free, sensitive means for overcoming these issues, wherein target binding liberates a dye that is complexed with the aptamer, producing an optical readout. However, broad utilization of these assays has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a rational approach to develop colorimetric cyanine dye&#8208;displacement assays that can be broadly applied to DNA aptamers regardless of their structure, sequence, affinity, or the physicochemical properties of their targets. Our approach should accelerate the development of mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure assays that could be applied for diverse analytical applications.

         <dc:description>
We describe a rapid light&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction that enables installation of N&#1013;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins at defined positions. Selective for cysteine residues, the method proceeds via interception of free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated desulfurization. The chemistry is operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere, and retains the native stereochemistry at the modified residue.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) enhance the repertoire of protein function and mediate or influence the activity of many cellular processes. The preparation of site&#8208;specifically and homogeneously modified proteins, to apply as tools to understand the biological role of PTMs, is a challenging task. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated desulfurative C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bond forming reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective installation of N&#1013;&#8208;modified sidechains into peptides and proteins of interest. Rapid, operationally simple, and tolerant to ambient atmosphere, we demonstrate the installation of a range of lysine (Lys) PTMs into model peptide systems and showcase the potential of this technology by site&#8208;selectively installing an N&#1013;Ac sidechain into recombinantly expressed ubiquitin (Ub).

         <title>A Photoinduced Dual&#8208;Wavelength Approach for 3D Printing and Self&#8208;healing of Thermosetting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing techniques have been widely used to produce high&#8208;resolution 3D thermosetting materials. However, the lack of repairability of these thermosets leads to the production of waste. In this study, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents are incorporated into resin formulations to allow visible light (405 nm) mediated 3D printing of materials with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the thermosets under UV light (365 nm), which enables reformation of the polymeric network. The self&#8208;healing process can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The impact of the type and concentration of RAFT agents in the polymer network on the healing efficiency is explored. Resins containing RAFT agents enable 3D printing of thermosets with self&#8208;healing properties, broadening the scope of future applications for polymeric thermosets in various fields.</dc:description>

In this study, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents are incorporated into resin formulations to allow visible light (405 nm) mediated 3D printing of materials with self-healing capabilities. The self-healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the thermosets under UV light (365 nm), which enables reformation of the polymeric network. The self-healing process can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The impact of the type and concentration of RAFT agents in the polymer network on the healing efficiency is explored. Resins containing RAFT agents enable 3D printing of thermosets with self-healing properties, broadening the scope of future applications for polymeric thermosets in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module &#8211; An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper halide based organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid semiconductors exhibit great potentials as light&#8208;emitting materials with excellent structural variety and optical tunability. Among them, copper halide hybrid molecular compounds with discrete inorganic modules are particularly interesting due to their high quantum efficiency, however, synthesizing highly efficient blue&#8208;emitting molecular clusters remains challenging. Here, we report a novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating coordinated anionic inorganic modules in these ionic species. Under such approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures are prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98%. Strong luminescence from the combination of ionic and covalent bonds in these compounds make them ideal candidates as alternative, rare&#8208;earth element free light&#8208;emitting materials for possible use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Resolution of Configurationally Stable Zwitterionic Pentacoordinate Silicon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant zwitterions featuring a chiral pentacoordinate silicon moiety is described. Their stability toward moisture and aerobic conditions allowed their optical resolution by means of chiral HPLC, which constitutes a premiere in the chemistry of organosilicon compounds. Studies on the kinetics of racemisation of enantiomerically pure substrates attest for their high configurational stabilities in solution.







Abstract
Stereogenic silicon centres in functionalised tetracoordinated organosilanes generally exhibit very high configurational stability under neutral conditions. This stability drops completely when higher coordination states of the silicon centre are reached due to rapid substituent exchange. Herein we describe the synthesis of chiral and neutral pentacoordinate silicon derivatives with high configurational stability. The zwitterionic nature of these air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant species allows for the first time their direct and efficient optical resolution using chiral HPLC techniques. By means of this method, pentacoordinate silicon compounds exhibiting high Si&#8208;inversion have been obtained as single enantiomers. A rationalisation of the enantiomerisation pathways has been also carried out using DFT calculations.

         <title>Unravelling Channel Structure&#8211;Diffusivity Relationships in Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic channel structure&#8211;diffusivity relationships in zeolites were unraveled using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. New insights into the mechanism of the enhanced diffusion in hierarchical zeolites were obtained.







Abstract
The development of improved zeolite materials for applications in separation and catalysis requires understanding of mass transport. Herein, diffusion of single molecules is tracked in the straight and sinusoidal channels of the industrially relevant ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. Distinct motion behaviors are observed in zeolite channels with the same geometry, suggesting heterogeneous guest&#8211;host interactions. Quantification of the diffusion heterogeneities in the sinusoidal and straight channels suggests that the geometry of zeolite channels dictates the mobility and motion behavior of the guest molecules, resulting in diffusion anisotropy. The study of hierarchical zeolites shows that the addition of secondary pore networks primarily enhances the diffusivity of sinusoidal zeolite channels, and thus alleviating the diffusion limitations of microporous zeolites.

         <title>Enzyme Control Over Ferric Iron Magnetostructural Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a first&#8208;in&#8208;class stimuli responsive Fe3+ complex that is switched between discrete antiferromagnetically coupled and high&#8208;spin paramagnetic species through the action of a carboxylesterase enzyme. We also demonstrate how enzyme&#8208;mediated switching of Fe3+ magnetic properties offers a mechanistic foundation for new bioresponsive magnetic resonance sensor technology.







Abstract
Fe3+ complexes in aqueous solution can exist as discrete mononuclear species or multinuclear magnetically coupled species. Stimuli&#8208;driven change to Fe3+ speciation represents a powerful mechanistic basis for magnetic resonance sensor technology, but ligand design strategies to exert precision control of aqueous Fe3+ magnetostructural properties are entirely underexplored. In pursuit of this objective, we rationally designed a ligand to strongly favor a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;oxo&#8208;bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled complex, but which undergoes carboxylesterase mediated transformation to a mononuclear high&#8208;spin Fe3+ chelate resulting in substantial T1&#8208;relaxivity increase. The data communicated demonstrate proof of concept for a novel and effective strategy to exert biochemical control over aqueous Fe3+ magnetic, structural, and relaxometric properties.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy has been proposed to synthesize Se single&#8208;atom catalysts anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon substances. The atomically dispersed Se sites with maximum atomic utilization and modulated electronic structures exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. This work provides a new method to synthesize non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts and opens up new horizons for atomically dispersed nanomaterials.







Abstract
Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single&#8208;atom catalysts have received widespread attention and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non&#8208;metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) via a high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8722;Se&#8722;C bond. Impressively, the obtained single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpasses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier.

     alt="Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile high-temperature reduction strategy has been proposed to synthesize Se single-atom catalysts anchored on N-doped carbon substances. The atomically dispersed Se sites with maximum atomic utilization and modulated electronic structures exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. This work provides a new method to synthesize non-metal single-atom catalysts and opens up new horizons for atomically dispersed nanomaterials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single-atom catalysts have received widespread attention and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non-metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) via a high-temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8722;Se&#8722;C bond. Impressively, the obtained single-atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpasses state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. Our discoveries demonstrate the promising prospects for utilizing metal-free single-atom-based materials for efficient electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept showing that the electrochemistry of redox liposomes single impacts is a powerful and efficient analytical technique for sensing target toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria such as Rhamnolipid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which interacts destructively with the lipid membrane of liposomes. A high sensitivity of sensing has been reached with a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid detected in less than 30&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30&#8197;minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Porphyrin&#8208;Complex Multi&#8208;Block Co&#8208;Oligomers by Defluorinative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key for sequential on&#8208;surface reaction: A coupling module of CF3 groups can react only when another reactant comes close enough. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to investigate the properties of the products and the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemical reaction has become a very powerful technique to synthesize nanostructures by linking small molecules in the bottom&#8208;up approach. Given the fact that most reactants are simultaneously activated at certain temperatures, a sequential reaction in a controlled way has remained challenging. Here, we present an on&#8208;surface synthesis of multi&#8208;block co&#8208;oligomers from trifluoromethyl (CF3) substituted porphyrin metal complexes. The oligomerization on Au(111) is demonstrated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Even after the first oligomerization of single monomer unit, the termini of the oligomer keep the CF3 group, which can be used as a reactant for further coupling in a sequential order. Consequently, copper, cobalt, and palladium complexes of bisanthracene&#8208;fused porphyrin oligomers were linked with each other in a designed order.

         <title>Nanoconfinement Engineering over Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Structured Copper towards Efficient Electrocatalytical C&#8722;C coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion and nanoconfinement effect of Cu hollow multi&#8208;shell structures is reported. As the shell number increases, there is a remarkable enhancement in both selectivity and activity toward C2+ species. Particularly, Cu hollow multi&#8208;shell structures with 3 shells exhibit a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#177;0.3&#8201;% with an impressive C2+ current density of 513.7&#177;0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement provides a promising solution to promote electrocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling, by dramatically altering the diffusion kinetics to ensure a high local concentration of C1 intermediates for carbon dimerization. Herein, under the guidance of finite&#8208;element method simulations results, a series of Cu2O hollow multi&#8208;shell structures (HoMSs) with tunable shell numbers were synthesized via Ostwald ripening. When applied in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the in situ formed Cu HoMSs showed a positive correlation between shell numbers and selectivity for C2+ products, reaching a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#177;0.3&#8201;% at a conversion rate of 513.7&#177;0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte. Mechanistic studies clarified the confinement effect of HoMSs that superposition of Cu shells leads to a higher coverage of localized CO adsorbate inside the cavity for enhanced dimerization. This work provides valuable insights for the delicate design of efficient C&#8722;C coupling catalysts.

         <title>A Lateral Flow Test for Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Mucus Using a New DNAzyme as the Recognition Element</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific lateral flow assay using an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme can detect S. aureus in nasal mucus. The assay is simple and can detect the presence or absence of S. aureus by eye with a total assay time of 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the selection and optimization of a new DNAzyme for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and the use of the DNAzyme to develop a simple lateral flow device (LFD) for detection of SA in nasal mucus. The DNAzyme was generated by in vitro selection using a crude extra/intracellular mixture derived from SA, which could be used directly for simple solution or paper&#8208;based fluorescence assays for SA. The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.

         <title>A Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Dimer of Au3 Superatoms Supported by Interlocked Tridentate Scaffolds Formed in Au18S2(SR)12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au18S2(SR)12, a new gold cluster that can be viewed as an interlocked dimer of Au9S(SR)6 cages, was synthesized using a bulky thiol ligand. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the Au6 core can be interpreted as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au3 superatoms.







Abstract
A new sulfur&#8208;containing gold cluster, Au18S2(STipb)12, was serendipitously obtained using the bulky thiol, 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzyl mercaptan (TipbSH), as protecting ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au18S2(STipb)12 has a deformed octahedral Au6 core clutched by two tridentate S[Au2(STipb)2]3 units in an interlocked manner. Based on density functional theory calculations, we propose that the Au6 core with two electrons is better viewed as a face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer of Au3(1e) superatoms rather than an electronically closed Au6(2e) superatom.

&lt;p&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, a new gold cluster that can be viewed as an interlocked dimer of Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S(SR)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cages, was synthesized using a bulky thiol ligand. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; core can be interpreted as a face-to-face dimer of Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; superatoms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new sulfur-containing gold cluster, Au&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(STipb)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, was serendipitously obtained using the bulky thiol, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzyl mercaptan (TipbSH), as protecting ligands. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(STipb)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; has a deformed octahedral Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; core clutched by two tridentate S[Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(STipb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units in an interlocked manner. Based on density functional theory calculations, we propose that the Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; core with two electrons is better viewed as a face-to-face dimer of Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(1e) superatoms rather than an electronically closed Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(2e) superatom.

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Enabled Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
By incorporating intramolecular S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent interactions (INIs) for boosting the intrinsic hole mobilities, two simple&#8208;structured dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) were designed and delivered a remarkable efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with decent device stability in inverted perovskite solar cells, demonstrating the great promise of the INI strategy for accessing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions (INIs) have served as a powerful strategy for accessing organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport properties. Herein, we apply the INI strategy for developing dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) by constructing two small&#8208;molecular HTMs featuring an INI&#8208;integrated backbone for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Upon incorporating noncovalent S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction into their simple&#8208;structured backbones, the resulting HTMs, BTORA and BTORCNA, showed self&#8208;planarized backbones, tuned energy levels, enhanced thermal properties, appropriate film morphology, and effective defect passivation. More importantly, the high film crystallinity enables the materials with substantial hole mobilities, thus rendering them as promising dopant&#8208;free HTMs. Consequently, the BTORCNA&#8208;based inverted PVSCs delivered a power conversion efficiency of 21.10&#8201;% with encouraging long&#8208;term device stability, outperforming the devices based on BTRA without S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction (18.40&#8201;%). This work offers a practical approach to designing charge transporting layers with high intrinsic mobilities for high&#8208;performance PVSCs.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations Involving the Activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of methods that exploit transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations for the assembly of cyclic systems is steadily growing. This Minireview covers the most relevant cyclization and cycloaddition approaches, discussed from a mechanistic perspective.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using transition&#8208;metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom economy, such reactions open unconventional retrosynthetic pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the activation of intrinsically inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and the selection among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues, especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely, the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored. Only recently has the number of reports on such annulations started to grow. Herein we give an overview of some of the more relevant advances in this exciting topic.

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Dinitrogen and Nitric Oxide to Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of (electro&#8208;)chemically driven, reductive N2 splitting with nitrogen atom transfer to NO is reported. Nitrous oxide generation directly from dinitrogen and nitric oxide defines a new strategy for direct oxidative nitrogen fixation. Initial coordination of an activating NO ligand prepares the chemically robust ReV nitride for Re&#8801;N/NO radical coupling.







Abstract
Reductive splitting of N2 is an attractive strategy towards nitrogen fixation beyond ammonia at ambient conditions. However, the resulting nitride complexes often suffer from thermodynamic overstabilization hampering functionalization. Furthermore, oxidative nitrogen atom transfer of N2 derived nitrides remains unknown. We here report a ReIV pincer platform that mediates N2 splitting upon chemical reduction or electrolysis with unprecedented yield. The N2 derived ReV nitrides undergo facile nitrogen atom transfer to nitric oxide, giving nitrous oxide nearly quantitatively. Experimental and computational results indicate that outer&#8208;sphere ReN/NO radical coupling is facilitated by the activation of the nitride via initial coordination of NO.

         <title>Engineering a Non&#8208;Natural Photoenzyme for Improved Photon Efficiency**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel HTS engineering platform to optimize photoenzymatic activity. The improvements in variants were correlated to an increase in enzymatic photon efficiency. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed a shift from a stepwise to a concerted mechanism. The platform was expanded to improve the synthesis of &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;&#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides.







Abstract
Photoenzymes are biological catalysts that use light to convert starting materials into products. These catalysts require photon absorption for each turnover, making quantum efficiency an important optimization parameter. Flavin&#8208;dependent &#8220;ene&#8221;&#8208;reductases (EREDs) display latent photoenzymatic activity for synthetically valuable hydroalkylations; however, protein engineering has not been used to optimize this non&#8208;natural function. We describe a protein engineering platform for the high throughput optimization of photoenzymes. A single round of engineering results in improved catalytic function toward the synthesis of &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;&#8208;lactams, and acyclic amides. Mechanistic studies show that key mutations can alter the enzyme's excited state dynamics, enhance its photon efficiency, and ultimately increase catalyst performance. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that engineered variants display dramatically decreased radical lifetimes, indicating an evolution toward a concerted mechanism.

         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic network with a honeycomb lattice constituted of 90&#8208;ring hexagons, the largest yet reported, was obtained by solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional fused aromatic networks (2D&#8197;FANs) have emerged as a highly versatile alternative to holey graphene. The synthesis of 2D&#8197;FANs with increasingly larger lattice dimensions will enable new application perspectives. However, the synthesis of larger analogues is mostly limited by lack of appropriate monomers and methods. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterisation and properties of an expanded 2D&#8197;FAN with 90&#8208;ring hexagons, which exceed the largest 2D&#8197;FAN lattices reported to date.

         <title>Conformational Flexibility of the Protein Insertase BamA in the Native Asymmetric Bilayer Elucidated by ESR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is an asymmetric bilayer. The effect of this asymmetry on protein structure and dynamics remains elusive. The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) mediates the folding and insertion of proteins into the outer membrane. Using in situ electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we show that the native outer membrane significantly enhances the dynamics of the BamA insertase of the BAM complex.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) consisting of the central &#946;&#8208;barrel BamA and four other lipoproteins mediates the folding of the majority of the outer membrane proteins. BamA is placed in an asymmetric bilayer and its lateral gate is suggested to be the functional hotspot. Here we used in situ pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance spectroscopy to characterize BamA in the native outer membrane. In the detergent micelles, the data is consistent with mainly an inward&#8208;open conformation of BamA. The native membrane considerably enhanced the conformational heterogeneity. The lateral gate and the extracellular loop 3 exist in an equilibrium between different conformations. The outer membrane provides a favorable environment for occupying multiple conformational states independent of the lipoproteins. Our results reveal a highly dynamic behavior of the lateral gate and other key structural elements and provide direct evidence for the conformational modulation of a membrane protein in situ.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and direct synthetic strategy that features a combination of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration for the synthesis of syn/anti&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, is present. The resulting oligomers show significant potential for organic electronic devices with the electron mobility up to 4.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report a facile and powerful strategy to prepare libraries of oligothienoacene diimides that include anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers using palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and an unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration. Through this strategy, a series of oligothienoacene diimides containing 6, 8, and 10 fused rings were synthesized. The molecular geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation have dramatic effects on the electronic properties, degree of crystallinity, and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Notably, single&#8208;crystal microfibers of syn&#8208;3&#8201;c show electron mobilities up to 4.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, illustrating the significant potential of these materials for organic electronic devices. Our work demonstrates the versatility of this strategy for the development of oligothienoacene diimide libraries, in particular complex and large syn&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, which are difficult to prepare by present methods.

         <title>A reconstructed Cu2P2O7 catalyst for selective CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) over Cu&#8208;based catalysts shows a great prospect with converting CO  2  into multicarbon (C  2+  ) fuels and chemicals. Herein, we introduce an A  2  M  2  O  7  structure into Cu&#8208;based catalyst through a solid&#8208;state reaction synthesis method.  The Cu  2  P  2  O  7  catalyst is electrochemically reduced to metallic Cu with a significant structure evolution from grain aggregates to highly porous structure under CO  2  RR conditions. The reconstructed Cu  2  P  2  O  7  catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 73.6% for C  2+  products at an applied current density of 350 mA cm  &#8208;2  , remarkably higher than the CuO counterparts. The reconstructed Cu  2  P  2  O  7  catalyst has high electrochemically active surface area and abundant defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites.  In situ  Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveal that CO adsorption with bridge and atop configurations is largely improved on Cu with defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites, which decreased the energy barrier of C&#8208;C coupling reaction for C  2+  products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial self&#8208;assembly systems typically exhibit limited capability in creating nature&#8208;inspired complex materials with advanced functionalities. Here, an effective co&#8208;assembly strategy is demonstrated for the facile creation of complex photonic structures with intriguing light reflections. Two different lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs) are placed within shrinking droplets to enable a cooperative working mechanism of microphase segregation and organized spontaneous emulsification, respectively. Layer assemblies of the lipophilic BCP and uniform water nanodroplets stabilized by the bottlebrush surfactant are both generated, and co&#8208;assembled into a bridged lamellar structure with the alternating arrangement of layers and closely packed nanodroplet arrays. Janus microspheres with diverse dual optical characteristics are successfully fabricated, and reflected wavelengths of light are highly tunable simply by changing formulation or molecular weight of BCP.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multivariate&#8208;Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging of Pro&#8208;metastatic Targets in Extracellular Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multivariate&#8208;gated DNA nanodevice was engineered for spatially selective, corelated imaging of ATP and MMP2/9 in extracellular tumor microenviroment. The simultaneous visualization of the dual pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers may allow to discriminate tumors with high risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Probing pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers is of significant importance to evaluate the risk of tumor metastasis, but spatially selective imaging of such targets in extracellular microenvironment is particularly challenging. By introducing the bilinguality of PNA/peptide hybrid that can speak both peptide substrate and nucleobase&#8208;pairing languages to combine with aptamer technology, we designed a smart DNA nanodevice programmed to respond sequentially to dual pro&#8208;metastatic targets, MMP2/9 and ATP, in extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME). The DNA nanodevice is established based on the combination of an ATP&#8208;responsive aptamer sensor and a MMP2/9&#8208;hydrolyzable PNA/peptide copolymer with a cell membrane&#8208;anchoring aptamer module. Taking 4T1 xenograft as a highly aggressive tumor model, the robustness of the DNA nanodevice in spatioselective imaging of MMP2/9 and ATP in TME is demonstrated. We envision that this design will enable the simultaneous visualization of multiple pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers, which allows to gain insights into their pathological roles in tumor metastasis.

         <title>Fully Condensed Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals: Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Structural Defects for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal, which features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structural defects, decorated with Pt and CoOx as redox cocatalysts efficiently drives the one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting for H2 and O2 production with a record apparent quantum efficiency of 12&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Conventional polymerization for the synthesis of carbon nitride usually generates amorphous heptazine&#8208;based melon with an abundance of undesired structural defects, which function as charge carrier recombination centers to decrease the photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a fully condensed poly (triazine imide) crystal with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and deficient structure defects was obtained by conducting the polycondensation in a mild molten salt of LiCl/NaCl. The melting point of the binary LiCl/NaCl system is around 550&#8201;&#176;C, which substantially restrain the depolymerization of triazine units and extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation. The optimized polymeric carbon nitride crystal exhibits a high apparent quantum efficiency of 12&#8201;% (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) for hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting, owing to the efficient exciton dissociation and the subsequent fast transfer of charge carriers.

         <title>Dynamic Manipulating Space&#8208;Resolved Persistent Luminescence in Core&#8211;Shell MOFs Heterostructures via Reversible Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiblock core&#8211;shell MOFs heterojunctions were prepared through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits both persistent luminescence and photochromic properties. The bright yellow afterglow in MOFs shell can be detected before irradiation but almost disappears after coloration upon continuous UV irradiation.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;controllable persistent luminescence at the single crystal level can be achieved by the integration of long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and photochromism within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for the first time. Moreover, the multiblock core&#8211;shell heterojunctions have been prepared utilizing the isostructural MOFs through an epitaxial growth process, in which the shell exhibits bright yellow afterglow emission that gradually disappears upon further irradiation, but the core does not show such property. Benefitting from combined persistent luminescence and photochromic behavior, a multiple encryption demo can be facilely designed based on the dynamic manipulating RTP via reversible photochromism. This work not only develops new types of dynamically photo&#8208;controllable afterglow switch, but also provides a method to obtain MOFs&#8208;based optical heterojunctions towards potential space/time&#8208;resolved information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>From Esters to Ketones via a Photoredox&#8208;Assisted Reductive Acyl Cross&#8208;Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction of two different carboxylic acid esters was developed for ketone synthesis. The reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions using Hantzsch ester (HE) as an organic reductant, with high chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. A large range of aryl and 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;acyl electrophiles, and 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl radical precursors were tolerated.







Abstract
A method was developed for ketone synthesis via a photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling (PARAC) using a nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two different carboxylic acid esters. A variety of aryl, 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl 2&#8208;pyridyl esters can act as acyl electrophiles while N&#8208;(acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) act as 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;radical precursors. Our PARAC strategy provides an alternative and reliable way to synthesize various sterically congested 3&#176;&#8208;3&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;2&#176;, and aryl&#8208;3&#176; ketones under mild and highly unified conditions, which have been otherwise difficult to access. The combined experimental and computational studies identified a Ni0/NiI/NiIII pathway for ketone formation.

         <title>A Selective and General Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminomethylation of Olefins to Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective synthesis of amines via hydroaminomethylation of olefins in the presence of the specific Co&#8208;tert&#8208;BuPy&#8208;Xantphos catalyst is presented. This novel system is complementary to previously known noble metal catalysts and constitutes one of the most general catalysts for HAM.







Abstract
A new cobalt catalyst is presented for the domino hydroformylation&#8208;reductive amination reaction of olefins. The optimal Co&#8208;tert&#8208;BuPy&#8208;Xantphos catalyst shows good to excellent linear&#8208;to&#8208;branched (n/iso) regioselectivity for the reactions of aliphatic alkenes with aromatic amines under mild conditions. This system is far more selective than traditional cobalt(I) catalysts and even better than most known rhodium catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)aromatics with a Trifluoromethyl Source and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new trifluoromethoxylation reaction through the combination of readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical conditions was developed. The synthetic utility of this new protocol is illustrated by the C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes and biorelevant molecules.







Abstract
Trifluoromethoxylated aromatics (ArOCF3) are valuable structural motifs in the area of drug discovery due to the enhancement of their desired physicochemical properties upon the introduction of the trifluoromethoxy group (CF3O). Although significant progress has been made recently in the introduction of CF3O group into aromatics, current methods either require the use of expensive trifluoromethoxylation reagents or require harsh reaction conditions. We present a conceptually new and operationally simple protocol for the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)aromatics by the combination of the readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds through the initial generation of CF3 radical followed by conversion to CF3O radical, addition to (hetero)aromatics and rearomatization. The utility of this electrochemical trifluoromethoxylation is illustrated by the direct incorporation of CF3O group into a variety of (hetero)aromatics as well as bio&#8208;relevant molecules.

         <title>Superstructures of Organic&#8211;Polyoxometalate Co&#8208;crystals as Precursors for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2D mesoporous Mo carbides/nitrides for catalytic hydrogen production was realized by a series of organic&#8211;polyoxometalate co&#8208;crystals (O&#8208;POCs). These metal&#8211;organic precursors enable to create Mo&#8208;based electrocatalysts composed of abundant nanocrystallites and heterojunctions with tunable micro&#8208; and nanostructure and mesoporosity, therefore resulted in high HER activity and stability in both alkaline condition and seawater.







Abstract
Molybdenum&#8208;based carbides and nitrides have been considered as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). One of the challenges in using Mo&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts is establishing well&#8208;defined precursors which can be transformed into Mo&#8208;based carbides/nitrides with controllable structure and porosity. We report the synthesis of a series of superstructures consisting of organic&#8211;polyoxometalate co&#8208;crystals (O&#8208;POCs) as a new type of metal&#8211;organic precursor to synthesize Mo&#8208;based carbides/nitrides in a controlled fashion and to use them for efficient catalytic hydrogen production. This protocol enables to create electrocatalysts composed of abundant nanocrystallites and heterojunctions with tunable micro&#8208; and nanostructure and mesoporosity. The best performing electrocatalyst shows high HER activity and stability with a low overpotential of 162&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (in comparison to Pt/C with 263&#8197;mV), which makes it one of the best non&#8208;noble metal HER catalysts in alkaline media and seawater.

         <title>Rapid, Ordered Polymerization of Crystalline Semiconducting Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted 2D ordered and rapid polymerization strategy is developed to prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs at the hundred&#8208;gram level within 20&#8197;minutes for the first time. Abundant single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit remarkable photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
The rapid synthesis of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) and exploration of the polymerization mechanism are highly desired for the research of crystalline porous polymers, but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a scalable microwave&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy to successfully prepare a series of highly crystalline and semiconducting CTFs within 20 minutes for the first time. By in situ imaging and time&#8208;dependent characterization, we proposed an ordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization mechanism for crystalline CTFs, in which the monomers rapidly polymerize into periodic 2D molecular sheets within 10&#8197;s and then grow into more ordered framework structures. Photocatalytic study of CTF with different crystallinity revealed that large crystalline domain could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. Single&#8208;layer and few&#8208;layer crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets could be obtained through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered CTFs and exhibit nearly fivefold improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate up to 7971&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Coordinatively Unsaturated Copper Paddle Wheel Clusters to Boost Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordinatively unsaturated Cu paddle wheel clusters were constructed with a facile &#8220;atomized trimesic acid&#8221; strategy. In&#8197;situ characterization demonstrated that coordinatively unsaturated carboxylate groups in the catalyst were maintained and oxidized metal centers were stable after electrolysis, whereby they promoted a proton&#8208;coupled multi&#8208;electron transfer reaction process to produce hydrocarbons from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. Second coordination sphere engineering is reported to be effective in the PCET process; however, little is known about the actual catalytic active sites under realistic operating conditions. We have designed a defect&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework, HKUST&#8208;1, through a facile &#8220;atomized trimesic acid&#8221; strategy, in which Cu atoms are modified by unsaturated carboxylate ligands, producing coordinatively unsaturated Cu paddle wheel (CU&#8722;CPW) clusters. We investigate the dynamic behavior of the CU&#8722;CPW during electrochemical reconstruction through the comprehensive analysis of in&#8197;situ characterization results. It is demonstrated that Cu2(HCOO)3 is maintained after electrochemical reconstruction and that is behaves as an active site. Mechanistic studies reveal that CU&#8722;CPW accelerates the proton&#8208;coupled multi&#8208;electron transfer (PCMET) reaction, resulting in a deep CO2 reduction reaction.

         <title>Emergence of a Promiscuous Peroxidase Under Non&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;induced generation of a transient catalytic microphases was shown in presence of a single amino acid functionalized fatty acid and a cofactor hemin. The transient state exhibited acceleration of catalytic potential resulting in degradation of the substrate. Furthermore, latent catalytic function was displayed to hydrolyze a precursor to yield the same substrate suggesting promiscuous activity.







Abstract
Herein, we report the substrate induced generation of a transient catalytic microenvironment from a single amino acid functionalized fatty acid in presence of a cofactor hemin. The catalytic state accessed under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions showed acceleration of peroxidase activity resulting in degradation of the substrate and subsequently led to disassembly. Equilibrated systems could not access the three&#8208;dimensional microphases and showed substantially lower catalytic activity. Further, the assembled state showed latent catalytic function (promiscuity) to hydrolyze a precursor to yield the same substrate. Consequently, the assembly demonstrated protometabolism by exploiting the peroxidase&#8208;hydrolase cascade to augment the lifetime and the mechanical properties of the catalytic state.

         <title>Highly Processable Covalent Organic Framework Gel Electrolyte Enabled by Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a general gelation strategy for the construction of highly processible covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;Gel materials through side&#8208;chain engineering. The COF&#8208;Gel is compatible with electronic devices with diverse functionality, including in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with a graphene&#8208;like structure present unique chemical and physical properties, they are essentially insoluble and infusible crystalline powders with poor processability, hindering their further practical applications. How to improve the processability of COF materials is a major challenge in this field. In this contribution, we proposed a general side&#8208;chain engineering strategy to construct a gel&#8208;state COF with high processability. This method takes advantages of large and soft branched alkyl side chains as internal plasticizers to achieve the gelation of the COF. We systematically studied the influence of the length of the side chain on the COF gel formation. Benefitting from their machinability and flexibility, this novel COF gel can be easily processed into gel&#8208;type electrolytes with specific shape and thickness, which were further applied to assemble lithium&#8208;ion batteries that exhibited high cycling stability.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Polymer Cyclization via Supramolecular Confinement of Cyanostilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular confinement effect facilictates cyclic polymerization of a telechelic cyanostilbene macromonomer via [2+2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition, in stark contrast to Z&#8208;E photo&#8208;isomerization in the monomeric state.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of cyclic polymers has received much attention in polymer chemistry field. Although photochemical cycloaddition of terminal &#960;&#8208;bonded units provides a plausible way toward cyclic polymerization, it remains challenging to avoid side reactions by manipulating the reaction selectivity. Herein supramolecular confinement has been developed as a promising strategy to address this issue, by introducing highly directional hydrogen bonds to the photo&#8208;reactive cyanostilbenes. The cyanostilbenes units on both ends of a telechelic macromonomer are orientationally aligned with high local concentrations, yielding [2+2] photo&#8208;cycloaddition products upon 430&#8197;nm light irradiation. It leads to the formation of cyclic polymers in the self&#8208;assembled state, in stark contrast to Z&#8208;E isomerization of cyanostilbenes in the monomeric state. Overall, supramolecular confinement effect exemplified in the current study provides new avenues toward cyclic topological polymers with high synthetic efficiency.

         <title>Highly Ethylene&#8208;Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enabled by Isolated Cu&#8722;S Motifs in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 precatalyst with stable isolated Cu&#8722;S motifs was prepared by the strategy of local sulfur doping. The precatalyst can be in situ reconstructed to obtain a Cu(S) matrix with active biphasic copper/copper sulfide interfaces, which delivers a current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Faradaic efficiency of ethylene to 57.2&#8201;% in the flow cell.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based materials are efficient electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to C2+ products, and most these materials are reconstructed in situ to regenerate active species. It is a challenge to precisely design precatalysts to obtain active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we develop a strategy based on local sulfur doping of a Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework precatalyst, in which the stable Cu&#8722;S motif is dispersed in the framework of HKUST&#8208;1 (S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1). The precatalyst exhibits a high ethylene selectivity in an H&#8208;type cell with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.0&#8201;%, and delivers a current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an ethylene FE up to 57.2&#8201;% in a flow cell. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption results demonstrate that Cu&#948;+ species stabilized by the Cu&#8722;S motif exist in S&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 during CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations indicate the partially oxidized Cu&#948;+ at the Cu/CuxSy interface is favorable for coupling of the *CO intermediate due to the modest distance between coupling sites and optimized adsorption energy.

         <title>Transformation of Crowded Oligoarylene into Perylene&#8208;Cored Chiral Nanographene by Sequential Oxidative Cyclization and 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic innovation to construct sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare  &#960;  &#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl&#8217;s condition, the reaction majorly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the  peri  &#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurational stable at 180 &#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45 kcal mol  &#8722;1  . These molecules also possess globally delocalized  &#960;  &#8208;systems with low HOMO/LUMO gaps, leading to nearly panchromatic absorption, intensive electronic circular dichroism signals and deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Expanding Ion&#8208;Transport Channels on Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish lithium&#8208;ion transport kinetics in anode materials triggers a huge voltage polarization and serious lithium metal plating, greatly restricting the cycling life and energy density of the fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here we propose a new idea of self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode and realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The self&#8208;expanded lithium&#8208;ion transport channels can be enabled by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling, reduce the energy barrier of lithium&#8208;ion transport and allow a fast lithium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion, whereby the severe voltage polarization and lithium metal plating are effectively eliminated. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds on the surface of graphdiyne successfully verifies the self&#8208;expanded lithium&#8208;ion transport channels, self&#8208;accelerated lithium in&#8208;plane/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration, and superior fast&#8208;charging capability with a high capacity (342 mA h g  &#8208;1  ) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan (22,000 cycles) under extremely fast&#8208;charging conditions (6 C rate, 1 C = 744 mA g  &#8208;1  ), even at low temperatures (&#8208;10 &#176;C). These results represent a platform for designing novel fast&#8208;charging anode materials with self&#8208;regulatable ion transport channels and significantly enhanced ion solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics.</dc:description>

The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping with atomic resolution, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and solid&#8208;state NMR. The structures consist of typical tetrahedra&#8208;octahedra&#8208;tetrahedra (  T  &#8208;  O  &#8208;  T  ) layers with P occupying  T  and Si occupying  O  layers, realizing the rare motif of sixfold coordinated silicon atoms in nitrides. The presence of H, as an imide group forming the SiN  4  (NH)  2  octahedra, is confirmed by SCXRD, MAS&#8208;NMR, and IR spectroscopy.

         <title>PDMS with Tunable Side Group Mobility and its Highly Permeable  Membrane for  Removal of Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the benchmarked organophilic membrane remain challenges for removal of aromatic compounds due to the undesirable transport channels. In this work, we propose to reconstruct the PDMS conformation with tunable side group mobility by introducing phenyl as rigid molecular spacer to relieve steric hindrance of large&#8208;sized aromatic molecules; meanwhile, polymer segments are loosely stacked to provide additional degrees of freedom as increasing the permeant size. Moreover, the reconstructed PDMS is engineered into composite membrane with preventing aromatic compounds condensation in the substrate pores. The resulting thin&#8208;film composite membrane achieved one order of magnitude higher flux (11.8 kg/m  2  h) with equivalent separation factor (12.3) compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;arts membranes for aromatic removal. The permeant&#8208;customized membrane molecular and microstructure designing strategy opens a new avenue to develop membranes for specific separation target.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M = Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ni(0) &#963;&#8208;Borane Complex of a Rigid Bidentate Borane/Phosphine Ligand: Boryl&#8208;Ni Formation by Oxidative Dehydrochloroborylation and Catalytic Activity for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While of interest, synthetically feasible access to boryl ligands and complexes remains limited, meaning such complexes remain underexploited in catalysis. For bidentate boryl ligands, oxidative addition of boranes to low valent Ir(I) or Pt(0) are the only examples yet reported. As part of our interest in developing improved group 10 ethylene polymerization catalysts, we present here an optimized synthesis of a novel, rigid borane/phosphine ligand and its Ni(0) &#963;&#8208;borane complex. From the latter, an unprecedented oxidative dehydrochloroborylation, to give a Ni(II) boryl complex, was achieved. Furthermore, this new B/P ligand allowed the nickel catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, which suggests that Ni(0) s&#8208;hydroborane complexes act as masked Ni(II) boryl hydride reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Magnesium Vanadates as Potential Mg&#8208;ion Cathode Materials Through an Ab Initio Guided Carbothermal Reduction Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many technologically relevant transition metal oxides for advanced energy storage and catalysis feature reduced transition metal (TM) oxides and are often nontrivial to prepare because of the need to control the reducing nature of the atmosphere in which they are synthesized. In this work, we show that an  ab initio  predictive synthesis strategy can be used to produce multiple gram&#8208;scale products of various MgV  x  O  y  &#8208;type phases (&#948;&#8208;MgV  2  O  5  , spinel MgV  2  O  4  , and MgVO  3  ) containing V  3+  or V  4+  relevant for Mg&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Characterization of these phases using  25  Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy illustrates the potential of  25  Mg NMR for studying reversible magnesiation and local charge distributions. Rotor&#8208;Assisted Population Transfer is used as a much needed signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise enhancement technique. The  ab initio  guided synthesis approach is seen as a step forward towards a predictive synthesis strategy for targeting specific complex TM oxides with variable oxidation states of technological importance beyond Mg&#8208;ion (and indeed Li&#8208;ion) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>From Impossible to Possible: Atom Economic Polymerization of Low Strain Five&#8208;Membered Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of propylene carbonate (PC) only affords oligomers with substantial unidentified by&#8208;products, which hinders the efficient utilization of PC. Through detailed studies, for the first time, a careful mechanism involving the in situ release of propylene oxide (PO) from PC decarboxylation is proposed. Further, we report a novel strategy of copolymerization of PC/cyclic anhydrides via in situ capture of the formed intermediates. Results show that PC is successfully transformed into polyesters. Especially for the ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of PC/phthalic anhydride (PA), a variety of advantages are manifold: (&#1110;) slow&#8208;release of PO ensuring a perfectly alternating structure; (ii) quantitative and fast transformation of PC. (iii) visualization of polymerization process by a CO  2  pressure gauge. Of importance, through tandem polymerizations, PC is fully transformed into polyesters and polycarbonates concurrently, thus achieving PC utilization with a high atom economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Elucidation of Cryptic Algaecides in Marine Algal&#8208;Bacterial Symbioses by NMR Spectroscopy and MicroED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial secondary metabolite discovery is often conducted in pure monocultures. In a natural setting, however, where metabolites are constantly exchanged, biosynthetic precursors are likely provided by symbionts or hosts. In the current work, we report eight novel and architecturally unusual secondary metabolites synthesized by the bacterial symbiont  Phaeobacter inhibens  from precursors that, in a native context, would be provided by their algal hosts. Three of these were produced at low titres and their structures were determined  de novo  using the emerging microcrystal electron diffraction method. Some of the new metabolites exhibited potent algaecidal activity suggesting that the bacterial symbiont can convert algal precursors, tryptophan and sinapic acid, into complex cytotoxins. Our results have important implications for the parasitic phase of algal&#8208;bacterial symbiotic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoroethanol as a Unique Additive for the Chemoselective Electrooxidation of Enamines to Access Unsymmetrically Substituted NH&#8208;Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles is described. The synthetic strategy comprises a challenging heterocoupling between two structurally diverse enamines  via  sequential chemoselective oxidation, addition, and cyclization processes. A series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted enamines were effectively cross&#8208;coupled from an equimolar mixture to synthesize various unsymmetrical pyrrole derivatives up to 84% yield. The desired cross&#8208;coupling was achieved by tuning the oxidation potential of the enamines by utilizing a &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol (TFE). Additionally, extensive computational studies reveal the unique role of TFE in promoting the heterocoupling process by regulating the activation energies of the reaction steps through H&#8208;bonding and C&#8722;H  &#8230;  &#960; interactions. Importantly, the developed electrochemical protocol was found to be equally efficient for the homocoupling of enamines to form symmetric pyrroles up to 92% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent and Selective RIPK1 Inhibitors Targeting Dual&#8208;Pockets for the Treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and Sepsis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sepsis, characterized with high risk of life&#8208;threatening organ dysfunction represents a major cause of health loss and World Health Organization (WHO) has labelled sepsis as the most urgent unmet medical need in 2017. The emerging biological understanding of the role of RIPK1 in sepsis has opened up an exciting opportunity to explore potent and selective RIPK1 inhibitors as an effective therapeutic strategy for SIRS and sepsis therapy. Herein, we synthesized a class of highly potent dual&#8208;mode RIPK1 inhibitors occupying both the allosteric and the ATP binding pockets, exemplified by compound  21  (  ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55  ) which is about 10&#8208;fold more potent than  GSK2982772  , and exhibits excellent kinase selectivity, good oral pharmacokinetics and good therapeutic effects in the LPS&#8208;induced sepsis model, suggesting that compound  ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55  is a highly promising preclinical candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton/Electron&#8208;Donors Enhancing Electrocatalytic Activity of Supported Conjugated Microporous Polymers for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phthalocyanines (MePc) hold great promises in electrochemical reduction of CO2  to value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the catalytic activity of MePc&#8208;containing polymers often suffers from the limited molecular modulation strategy. Herein, we synthesize an ultrathin conjugated microporous polymer sheath around carbon nanotubes by an ionothermal copolymerization of CoPc and H2Pc via the Scholl reaction. Given the H2Pc&#8208;mediated regulation in synthesis, Co(II) metal is well preserved in form of single atoms on the polymer sheath of carbon nanotubes. With synergistic effect of H2Pc moieties as proton/electron donors, the composites can selectively reduce CO2&#160;to CO with a high Faradic efficiency (  max.  97% at &#8208;0.9 V) in broad potential windows, exceptional turnover frequency (97,592 h&#8208;1  at &#8208;0.65 V) and large current density (&gt; 200 mA cm&#8208;2). It is thus desirable to develop a family of heterogeneous polymerized MePc with molecularly regulating electrocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu(0)&#8208;Cu(I) Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  on polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt; 2e  &#8211;  ) selectivity, while most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu(0)&#8208;Cu(I) tandem catalyst for producing C  2+  products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C  2+  faradaic efficiency (FE  C2+  ) of 76.1% with a high partial current density of 304.2 mA cm  &#8211;2  is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu(0)&#8208;PIL&#8208;Cu(I) interfaces are vital for such a reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu(0)&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C  2+  selectivity, while Cu(I) species derived PIL&#8208;Cu(I) interfaces exhibit high activity of C&#8211;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Besides, the presence of PIL layer promotes the C  2+  selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8211;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>A Genuine Stannylone with a Monoatomic Two&#8208;Coordinate Tin(0) Atom Supported by a Bis(silylene) Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene)&#8208;stabilized stannylone with a two&#8208;coordinate Sn0 atom and its bis&#8208;Fe(CO)4 complex have been synthesized and structurally characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their bonding situation have been uncovered by density functional theory calculations, indicating a genuine stannylone character with two lone pairs of electrons at the tin atom.







Abstract
The monoatomic zero&#8208;valent tin complex (stannylone) {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Sn0} 5 stabilized by a bis(silylene)xanthene ligand, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its bis&#8208;tetracarbonyliron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Sn0[Fe(CO)4]2} 4 are reported. The stannylone 5 bearing a two&#8208;coordinate zero&#8208;valent tin atom is synthesized by reduction of the precursor 4 with potassium graphite. Compound 4 results from the SnII halide precursor {[SiII(Xant)SiII]SnIICl}Cl 2 or {[SiII(Xant)SiII]SnBr2} 3 through reductive salt&#8208;metathesis reaction with K2Fe(CO)4. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO&#8208;1 of 5 correspond to a &#960;&#8208;type lone pair with delocalization into both adjacent vacant orbitals of the SiII atoms and a &#963;&#8208;type lone pair at the Sn0 center, respectively, indicating genuine stannylone character.

         <title>Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondrial DNA Base Excision Repair Reveals Dynamics of Oxidative Stress Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial function in cells declines with aging and with neurodegeneration, due in large part to accumulated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that arise from deficient DNA repair. However, measuring this repair activity is challenging. Here we employ a molecular approach for visualizing mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) activity  in situ  by use of a fluorescent probe (  UBER  ) that reacts rapidly with AP sites resulting from BER activity. Administering the probe to cultured cells revealed signals that were localized to mitochondria, enabling selective observation of mtDNA BER intermediates. The probe showed elevated DNA repair activity under oxidative stress, and responded to suppression of glycosylase activity. Furthermore, the probe illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of BER. Absence of MTH1 in cells resulted in elevated demand for BER activity upon extended oxidative stress, while the absence of OGG1 activity limited glycosylation capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescent Probe for Human Cytochrome P450 3A and the Visualization of Mechanism&#8208;Based Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology is the science of building systems that mimic the structure and function of living cells from scratch. To do this, researchers combine tools from chemistry, materials science and biochemistry to develop functional and structural building blocks to construct synthetic cell&#8208;like systems. The many strategies and materials that have been developed in recent decades have enabled scientists to engineer synthetic cells and organelles that mimic essential functions and behaviors of natural cells. Examples include synthetic cells that can synthesize their own ATP using light, maintain metabolic reactions through enzymatic networks, perform gene replication, and even grow and divide. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the design and construction of synthetic cells and organelles using the bottom&#8208;up approach. Our goal is to present representative synthetic cells of increasing complexity and strategies for solving distinct challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, especially by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stage of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, impeding the cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We therefore focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective  C  &#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Amino Acid Recognition Enables Effective Hydrogen Peroxide Activation at a Manganese Oxidation Catalys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise delivery of a proton plays a key role in O  2  activation at iron oxygenases, enabling the crucial O&#8208;O cleavage step that generates the oxidizing high valent metal&#8208;oxo species. Such proton is delivered by acidic residues that may either directly bind the iron center or lie in its second coordination sphere. Herein, a supramolecular strategy for enzyme&#8208;like H  2  O  2  activation at a biologically inspired manganese catalyst, with nearly stoichiometric amount (1&#8208;1.5 equivalents) of a carboxylic acid is disclosed. Key for this strategy is the incorporation of an &#945;,&#969;&#8208;amino acid in the second coordination sphere of a chiral catalyst via remote ammonium&#8208;crown ether recognition. The properly positioned carboxylic acid function enables effective activation of hydrogen peroxide, leading to catalytic asymmetric epoxidation. Modulation of both amino acid and catalyst structure can tune the efficiency and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, and a study on the oxidative degradation pathway of the system is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing A New Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 Inspired by the Phase Transition of the BaB2O4 (BBO) Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetry (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4 to uncover a new NCS chalcogenide, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 which exhibits well&#8208;balanced nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matchable second harmonic generation (SHG) response (0.6&#215;AgGaS2) and wide transparent window (0.5&#8211;25&#8197;&#956;m). These performances indicate that &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 is a promising IR NLO crystal.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals play a significant role in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing a new IR NLO crystal remains a huge challenge because of the unpredictability of inorganic structures. Herein, inspired by phase transformation of the famous BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal, a temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetric (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4 to uncover a new NCS ternary chalcogenide, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 which can exhibit the well&#8208;balanced NLO properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matching SHG response (&#8776;0.6&#215;AgGaS2), high LDT (10&#215;AgGaS2), and large birefringence (&#916;n=0.18 in the visible region). Therefore, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 will be a promising IR NLO crystal. The analysis for the structure&#8208;property relationship shows that the excellent NLO properties of &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 mainly originate from edge&#8208;sharing GaSe4 tetrahedral chains, which are different from B3O6 groups in &#946;&#8208;BBO and respect a new direction for the design of IR NLO crystals. So, we believe that the current research provides not only a new IR NLO crystal but also some insights for the design of new IR NLO crystals.

         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of bivalent water soluble calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene hosts,&#160;Super&#8208;sCx4&#160;and&#160;Super&#8208;sCx5&#160;as new broad&#8208;spectrum supramolecular binders of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Synthesis was achieved using the target bisquaternary amine NMBAs as a template to link two highly anionic&#160;p&#8208;sulfonatocalixarene building blocks&#160;in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic hosts&#160;Super&#8208;sCx4&#160;and&#160;Super&#8208;sCx5&#160;bind by engaging both quaternary amines present on a variety of NMBAs.

         <title>A Bright, Renal&#8208;Clearable NIR&#8208;II Brush Macromolecular Probe with Long Blood Circulation Time for Kidney Disease Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early detection of kidney disease is of vital importance due to their current prevalence worldwide. Fluorescence imaging, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has been regarded as a promising technique for the early diagnosis of kidney disease due to the superior resolution and sensitivity. However, the reported NIR&#8208;II organic renal&#8208;clearable probes are hampered by their low brightness (&#949;  max  &#934;  f&gt;1000 nm  &lt; 10 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and limited blood circulation time (  t  1/2  &lt; 2 h), which impede the targeted imaging performance. Herein, we develop the aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) brush macromolecular probes (Fudan BDIPY Probes (  FBP 912  )) with high brightness (&#949;  max  &#934;  f&gt;1000 nm  ~ 60 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ), which is about 10&#8208;fold higher than that of previously reported NIR&#8208;II renal&#8208;clearable probes.  FBP 912  exhibits an average diameter of ~ 4 nm and high renal clearance efficiency (~65% excretion through the kidney within 12 h), showing superior performance for non&#8208;invasively diagnosis of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (RIR) earlier than clinical serum&#8208;based protocols. Additionally, the high molecular weight polymer brush enables  FBP 912  with prolonged circulation time (  t  1/2  ~ 6.1 h) and higher brightness than traditional PEGylated renal&#8208;clearable control fluorophores (  t  1/2  &lt; 2 h), facilitating for 4T1 tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photoswitching between Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence by Manipulating Excited State Dynamics in Molecular Aggregate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence&#8208;phosphorescence pathways in organic molecular aggregate remains a challenge due to the complicated singlet&#8208;triplet excited state dynamics process. Herein, we demonstrated a successful example (o&#8208;BFT) to realize photoreversible fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching based on an effective strategy of integrating a phosphor (dibenzofuran) with a photoswitch (dithienylbenzothiophene). o&#8208;BFT exhibited dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in both powder and doping polymer film. Notably, the long&#8208;lived RTP of o&#8208;BFT could be repeatedly erased and restored through reversible photocyclization and decyclization under alternate ultraviolet and visible photoirradiation. In&#8208;depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo&#8208;controlled triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light&#8208;activated o&#8208;BFT to photoisomer c&#8208;BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence&#8208;RTP switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Wrapped Multiple Resonance Fluorophors for Suppression of Concentration Quenching and Spectrum Broadening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically wrapped multiple resonance (MR) dopants with the MR&#8208;core sandwiched by bulk substituents have been developed to suppress molecular interactions, realizing organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3&#8211;37.2&#8201;%, identical small FWHMs of 24&#8197;nm and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;20&#8197;wt&#8201;%).







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) emitters are promising for highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrowband emission; however, they still face intractable challenges with concentration&#8208;caused emission quenching, exciton annihilation, and spectral broadening. In this study, sterically wrapped MR dopants with a fluorescent MR core sandwiched by bulk substituents were developed to address the intractable challenges by reducing intermolecular interactions. Consequently, high photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields of &#8805;90&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &#8804;25&#8197;nm over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;20&#8197;wt&#8201;%) were recorded. In addition, we demonstrated that the sandwiched MR emitter can effectively suppress Dexter interaction when doped in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, eliminating exciton loss through dopant triplet. Within the above dopant concentration range, the optimal emitter realizes remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3&#8211;37.2&#8201;%, identical small FWHMs of 24&#8197;nm, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs in OLEDs.

         <title>Transport of Molecular Cargo by Interaction with Virus&#8208;Like Particle RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of intercalating dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) to polynucleotides allows for a simple method to load RNA&#8208;rich virus&#8208;like particles with molecular cargo, and then to release that cargo by diffusion. TO&#8208;labeled molecules come out much slower than they go in because of the high RNA concentration inside the shell; the surprise is how much cargo these easily produced nanocontainers can carry.







Abstract
Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) derived from Leviviridae virions contain substantial amounts of cellular and plasmid&#8208;derived RNA. This encapsidated polynucleotide serves as a reservoir for the efficient binding of the intercalating dye thiazole orange (TO). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and oligopeptides of varying length, end&#8208;functionalized with TO, were loaded into VLPs up to approximately 50&#8201;% of the mass of the capsid protein (hundreds to thousands of cargo molecules per particle, depending on size). The kinetics of TO&#8211;PEG binding included a significant entropic cost for the reptation of long chains through the capsid pores. Cargo molecules were released over periods of 20&#8211;120&#8197;hours following simple reversible first&#8208;order kinetics in most cases. These observations define a simple general method for the noncovalent packaging, and subsequent release, of functional molecules inside nucleoprotein nanocages in a manner independent of modifications to the capsid protein.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling Is Unlikely to Be the Rate&#8208;Determining Step in the Formation of C2+ Products in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Reduction of CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetic and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopic results indicate that the C&#8722;C coupling is unlikely to be the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the formation of C2+ products in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction. Electrochemical hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water as the proton donor is proposed as the RDS.







Abstract
The identity of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu catalysts remains unresolved because: 1)&#8197;the presence of mass transport limitation of CO; and 2)&#8197;the absence of quantitative correlation between CO partial pressure (pCO) and surface CO coverage. In this work, we determined CO adsorption isotherms on Cu in a broad pH range of 7.2&#8211;12.9. Together with electrokinetic data, we demonstrate that the reaction orders of adsorbed CO at pCO &lt;0.4 and &gt;0.6 atm are 1st and 0th, respectively, for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products on three Cu catalysts. These results indicate that the C&#8722;C coupling is unlikely to be the RDS in the formation of C2+ products in the CORR. We propose that the hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water is the RDS, and the site competition between CO and water leads to the observed transition of the CO reaction order.

         <title>An Iron(III) Superoxide Corrole from Iron(II) and Dioxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;superoxide corrole has been generated from a ferrous corrole and dioxygen, and was found to be capable of indole dioxygenation and H&#8208;atom transfer reactions.







Abstract
A new structurally characterized ferrous corrole [FeII(ttppc)]&#8722; (1) binds one equivalent of dioxygen to form [FeIII(O2&#8722;.)(ttppc)]&#8722; (2). This complex exhibits a 16/18O2&#8208;isotope sensitive &#957;(O&#8208;O) stretch at 1128&#8197;cm&#8722;1 concomitantly with a single &#957;(Fe&#8208;O2) at 555&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating it is an &#951;1&#8208;superoxo (&#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221;) iron(III) complex. Complex 2 is the first well characterized Fe&#8208;O2 corrole, and mediates the following biologically relevant oxidation reactions: dioxygenation of an indole derivative, and H&#8208;atom abstraction from an activated O&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Moderate Surface Segregation Promotes Selective Ethanol Production in CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction over CoCu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is described for theory&#8208;based catalyst optimization of CoCu alloys in CO2 hydrogenation. Moderate Co surface segregation, boosted ethanol production, and suppressed methane generation suggest that theory&#8208;guided catalyst optimization could be beneficial in similar alloy systems.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;copper (CoCu) catalysts have industrial potential in CO/CO2 hydrogenation reactions, and CoCu alloy has been elucidated as a major active phase during reactions. However, due to elemental surface segregation and dealloying phenomena, the actual surface morphology of CoCu alloy is still unclear. Combining theory and experiment, the dual effect of surface segregation and varied CO coverage over the CoCu(111) surface on the reactivity in CO2 hydrogenation reactions is explored. The relationship between C&#8722;O bond scission and further hydrogenation of intermediate *CH2O was discovered to be a key step to promote ethanol production. The theoretical investigation suggests that moderate Co segregation provides a suitable surface Co ensemble with lateral interactions of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO, leading to promoted selectivity to ethanol, in agreement with theory&#8208;inspired experiments.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Polyrotaxane Monolayer with Emergent and Steerable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional chiral polyrotaxane monolayer with circularly polarized luminescent activity was fabricated by utilizing cyclodextrins as chiral wheels and 2D dynamic covalent organic frameworks as luminescent polymeric axles through a combined strategy of one&#8208;pot host&#8211;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Here, we propose a mechanically interlocked strategy to achieve a 2D chiral polyrotaxane (2D CPR) monolayer with emergent and steerable CPL activity by utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the chiral wheel and a luminescent dynamic covalent organic framework as 2D polymeric axle. Such methodology, integrating host&#8211;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry, enabled the direct construction of a delaminated 2D CPR monolayer with extraordinarily large size (up to tens of micrometers) and simultaneously endowed chirality to the extended 2D CPR network to generate CPL activity. Importantly, not only the structure but also the CPL performance of the 2D CPR network can be further regulated by the feeding amount of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This work demonstrated a monolayered 2D CPR with CPL activity for the first time. The insightful structure&#8211;property relationship of the induced CPL will be of benefit for a deeper understanding of the excited&#8208;state chirality of 2D chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Oriented UiO&#8208;67 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane with Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along the [022] direction, results in more interconnected trans&#8208;membrane channels for ion transport, shows ultrahigh Li+ ion permeability and excellent Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. The ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ selectivity is associated with the difference in the energy barrier of ion transport across the membrane caused by the varying extents of partial dehydration of hydrated ions.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) membranes with high pore density and tunable pore size down to the subnanoscale exhibit great potential in ion separation when appropriately designed and prepared. By a washing&#8208;assisted secondary growing method, a well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along the [022] direction was synthesized on a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;modified AAO substrate. Because of the oriented growth of UiO&#8208;67 nanocrystals, highly interconnected ion&#8208;transporting channels are created throughout the UiO&#8208;67/AAO membrane capable of achieving an ultrahigh Li+ permeance of 27.01&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 as well as very decent Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of up to 159.4. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high selectivity is associated with the large disparity of the transport energy barrier between Li+ and Mg2+, which is caused by different extents of ion dehydration in unique bimodal and oriented membrane channels.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Dominate Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in Zeolite SSZ&#8208;42: A Classification of Their Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a high abundance of hydrogen bonding of Br&#248;nsted acid sites. These occur mainly due to the existence of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;rings, with suitable alignment of oxygen atoms, in which the acidic bridging OH groups can interact with oxygen atoms on the opposite side of the rings. 1H NMR spectroscopic components of the acid sites overlap with coexisting defect silanol groups that are also hydrogen&#8208;bonded.







Abstract
The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a remarkable high abundance (&#8776;80&#8201;%) of hydrogen&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), which are deshielded from the 1H chemical shift of unperturbed BAS at typically 4&#8197;ppm. This is due to their interaction with neighboring oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework when oxygen alignments are suitable. The classification and diversity of hydrogen bonding is assessed by DFT calculations, showing that oval&#8208;shaped 6&#8208;rings and 5&#8208;rings allow for a stronger hydrogen bond to oxygen atoms on the opposite ring side, yielding higher experimental chemical shifts (&#948; (1H)=6.4&#8197;ppm), than circular 6&#8208;rings (&#948;(1H)=5.2&#8197;ppm). Cage&#8208;like structures and intra&#8208;tetrahedral interactions can also form hydrogen bonds. The alignment of oxygen atoms is expected to impact their role in the stabilization of intermediates in catalytic reactions, such as surface alkoxy groups and possibly transition states.

         <title>Hierarchical, Highly Open Microtubes and Columnar Liquid Crystals Self&#8208;Assembled from Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Colloidal Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideal colloidal ring model system for self&#8208;assembly (SA) is synthesized and its SA is studied. A variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes to highly open liquid crystals is achieved. Staged SA results in complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies, which, as new building blocks, further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. A plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found.







Abstract
The use of simple building blocks to produce hierarchical and porous structured materials is highly desired. Rings are simple colloidal particles but unique for their internal cavities. Here we report the self&#8208;assembly (SA) of colloidal rings with tunable asymmetry mediated by a depletion force and demonstrate that a variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes, flexible chains, (plastic) crystals to highly open liquid crystals (LCs) can be formed along the predesigned SA paths. In particular, the SA is staged in binary or ternary systems. Large rings first form complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies by capturing smaller rings, which, as new building blocks, can further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. Moreover, a plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found from asymmetrical rings. The SA with colloidal rings opens a new avenue to construct hierarchical and porous ordered metamaterials.

         <title>Sequential Metal Catalysis towards 7&#8208;Oxostaurosporine and Its Non&#8208;Natural Septanose Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo synthetic method towards bioactive indolocarbazole glycoside natural products is reported. The signature event features efficient sequential metal catalysis that generates the key bicyclic intermediate. The utility of this method is demonstrated by a very short formal synthesis of natural 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine as well as by the synthesis of the non&#8208;natural septanose analogue.







Abstract
We report sequential metal catalysis towards indolocarbazole glycosides. The signature event is highlighted by i) Pd0&#8208;catalyzed addition of indolocarbazole to alkoxyallene combined with ring&#8208;closing&#8208;metathesis; ii) Ru&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective olefin migration; iii) PdII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization to build the bicyclic core structure of the target compounds. This approach gave access to both natural pyranose&#8208; and non&#8208;natural septanose glycosides. A short formal synthesis of 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine was achieved via this strategy.

         <title>Ultrathin In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient CO2 Chemical Fixation</title>

Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterointerface for CO2 chemical fixation into dimethyl carbonate.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added organics is regarded as a competitive and viable method in large scale industrial production, during which the catalysts with promoting CO2 activation ability are needed. Herein, we proposed an in&#8208;plane heterostructure strategy to construct Lewis acid&#8211;base sites for efficient CO2 activation. By taking ultrathin in&#8208;plane Cu2O/Cu heterostructures as a prototype, we show that Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on heterointerface can facilitate a mixed C and O dual coordination on surface, which not only strengthen CO2 adsorption, but also effectively activate the inert molecules. As revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lewis acid&#8208;base sites could readily activate CO2 to .CO2&#8722; species, which is the key intermediate radical for CO2 fixation. As a result, abundant Lewis acid&#8211;base sites endow Cu2O/Cu nanosheets with excellent performances for dimethyl carbonate generation, a high conversion yield of 28&#8201;% with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity under mild conditions. This study provides a model structure for CO2 fixation reactions.

         <title>Deoxygenation of Nitrous Oxide and Nitro Compounds Using Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene)Amido Iron Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient catalytic degradation of N2O to N2 by well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complexes under mild conditions involving the cooperative effect between the iron and silylene ligands is reported. Selective reductions of nitro compounds to amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity has been developed using the same approach.







Abstract
Herein, we report the efficient degradation of N2O with a well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complex as catalyst. The deoxygenation of N2O using the iron silanone complex 4 as a catalyst and pinacolborane (HBpin) as a sacrificial reagent proceeds smoothly at 50&#8201;&#176;C to form N2, H2, and (pinB)2O. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iron&#8211;silicon cooperativity is the key to this catalytic transformation, which involves N2O activation, H atom transfer, H2 release and oxygenation of the boron sites. This approach has been further developed to enable catalytic reductions of nitro compounds, producing amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Inhibitor&#8208;Mediated Structural Transition in a Minimal Amyloid Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the ultimate dipeptide that forms typical amyloid fibrils shows a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. However, when crystallized in the presence of an amyloid&#8208;inhibitor the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix).







Abstract
Despite the fundamental clinical importance of amyloid fibril formation, its mechanism is still enigmatic. Crystallography of minimal amyloid models was a milestone in the understanding of the architecture and biological activities of amyloid fibers. However, the crystal structure of ultimate dipeptide&#8208;based amyloids is not yet reported. Herein, we present the crystal structure of a typical amyloid&#8208;forming minimal dipeptide, Ac&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;NH2 (Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2), showing a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. The simplicity of the structure helped in investigating amyloid&#8208;inhibition using crystallography, never previously reported for larger peptide models. Interestingly, in the presence of an inhibitor, the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix). This study promotes our understanding of the mechanism of amyloid formation and of the structural transitions that occur during the inhibition process in a most fundamental model.

         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) is showing increasing power in the construction of anionic supramolecular architectures. Herein, by expanding the anion centers from oxoanion (phosphate or sulfate) to organic tris&#8208;carboxylates, an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a highly entangled, double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology have been assembled with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination &#8220;centers&#8221; in constructing novel topologies with increasing complexity and diversity compared to phosphate or sulfate ions on account of the modifiable size and easy functionalization character of these organic anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Raman Fiber Photometry for Understanding Mitochondrial Superoxide Burst and Extracellular Calcium Ion Influx upon Acute Hypoxia in the Brain of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of multiple molecules in mitochondria across the whole brain of freely moving animals is the key bottleneck, for understanding the physiological and pathological mechanisms of mitochondria that plays in the brain events. Here we built up a Raman fiber photometry, and created a highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe based on triple&#8208;recognition strategies of chemical reaction, charge transfer, and characteristic fingerprint peaks, for tracking and simultaneous quantitation of mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  , Ca  2+  and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal upon hypoxia. It was found that mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  , Ca  2+  and pH changed from superficial to deep brain regions upon hypoxia. It was discovered that hypoxia&#8208;induced mitochondrial O  2  &#9679;&#8208;  burst was regulated by ASIC1a, leading to mitochondrial Ca  2+  overload and acidification. Furthermore, we found the overload of mitochondrial Ca  2+  was almost attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca  2+  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new complexity building photoinduced cascade which amounts to an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] cycloaddition topology is developed to access complex nitrogen polyheterocycles. This photocascade is initiated by the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single experimentally simple photochemical step&#160;with up to 220 mcbit complexity increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Copolyester Monomers from Plant&#8208;Based Acrylate and Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PCTA is an important copolyester that has been widely used in our&#160;daily necessities. Currently, its monomers are industrially produced from petroleum&#8208;derived xylene.&#160;To reduce the reliance on fossil energy, we herein disclose an alternative route to access PCTA monomer (terephthalate/isophthalate = 2.4/1) in 61% overall yield&#160;using&#160;plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The process includes Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction&#160;of acetaldehyde&#160;with acrylate, subsequent one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with acrylate over H2SO4/SiO2&#160;catalyst, and final Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. Besides, when varying the final step to hydrogenation, another important monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol&#160;(1,4&#8208;trans/1,4&#8208;cis/1,3&#8208;trans/1,3&#8208;cis&#160;= 5.2/2/2.5/1) can be produced in 67% overall yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear Extension of Anthracene via B&#8592;N &#160;Lewis Pair Formation: Effects on Optoelectronic Properties and Singlet O2 Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation offers an opportunity to judiciously fine&#8208;tune the structural features and optoelectronic properties, to suit the demands of applications in organic electronic devices, bioimaging, and as sensitizers for singlet oxygen. We demonstrate that the N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anthracene offers access to linearly extended acene derivatives Py&#8208;BR (R = Et, Ph, C6F5). In comparison to indeno&#8208;fused 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene, the formal &#8220;BN for CC&#8221; replacement in Py&#8208;BR selectively lowers the LUMO, resulting in a much reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. An even more extended conjugated system with seven six&#8208;membered rings in a row (Qu&#8208;BEt) is obtained by borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)anthracene. Fluorinated Py&#8208;BPf shows particularly advantageous properties, including low&#8208;lying HOMO and LUMO levels, strong yellow&#8208;green fluorescence, and effective singlet oxygen sensitization, while resisting self&#8208;sensitized conversion to its endoperoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective&#160;O&#8208;Glycosylations by Pyrylium Salt Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite many years of invention, the field of carbohydrate chemistry remains rather inaccessible to non&#8208;specialists, which limits the scientific impact and reach of the discoveries made in the field. Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non&#8208;specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective O&#8208;glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non&#8208;specialists. The reaction exhibits varying degrees of stereospecificity, resulting in &#946;&#8208;selective glycosylations from &#945;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates, whilst an &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation proceeds from &#946;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2&#8208;like substitution on the protonated electrophile.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductor, hepta(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), was incorporated into a DNA tensegrity triangle motif using a covalent strategy. 3D arrays were self&#8208;assembled from an HPV&#8208;DNA pseudo&#8208;rhombohedron edge by rational design and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Templated by the DNA motif, HPV molecules exist as single&#8208;molecule fluorescence emitters at the concentration of 8mM within the crystal lattice. The anisotropic fluorescence emission from HPV&#8208;DNA crystals indicates HPV molecules are well aligned in the macroscopic 3D DNA lattices. Sophisticated nanodevices and functional materials constructed from DNA can be developed from this strategy by addressing functional components with molecular accuracy.</dc:description>

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of Polymerized Dioxolane as Solid Electrolyte and its Thermal Decomposition Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerized&#8208;dioxolane(P&#8208;DOL) is of potential as a solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolyte(SPE) due to its high Li+&#8208;conductivity, good compatibility with Li&#8208;metal and desired preparation method of in&#8208;situ polymerization in cells. In this study, SnF2 was demonstrated not only to be an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL at room temperature, but also an effective additive for improving interfacial wettability and suppressing dendrite through the reaction with Li&#8208;metal and the formation of LiF/LixSn based composite solid electrolyte interlayer(SEI). Using the SnF2 polymerized P&#8208;DOL containing 1M LiTFSI as SPE(P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE), obviously denser Li&#8208;deposition was obtained, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) Li/LiFePO4 cell delivered stable cycling over 350 cycles at 45oC. At the same time, the irreversible decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE into formaldehyde and small molecule epoxides are observed at 110oC, which is even initiated at lower temperature of 40oC under vacuum. This thermal decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE in pouch cell causes huge volume swell, and therefore putting a strict limitation on the operating temperature window for the P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Axially Chiral Styrene&#8208;Based Organocatalysts and Their Application in Catalytic Asymmetric (2+4) Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine catalysts, which have unique characteristics such as an efficient synthetic route, multiple chiral elements and multiple activating groups, has been rationally designed. These new chiral catalysts have proven to be efficient organocatalysts, enabling the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with homophthalic anhydrides in good yields (up to 96%) with excellent stereoselectivities (all &gt;95:5 dr, up to 98% ee). More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the important role of axially chiral styrene moiety in controlling both the reactivity and the enantioselectivity. This work not only represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea&#8208;tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, but also gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate profiling of mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P via a site&#8208;specific photocrosslinking approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. Here we combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site&#8208;specific incorporation of the diazirine&#8208;bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV&#8208;irradiation of cells allows to covalently trap hClpP to substrate proteins and to substantiate hClpP&#8217;s major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows to identify substrate dynamics upon external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP&#8208;substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified View on Varied Ultrafast Dynamics of the Primary Process in Microbial Rhodopsins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics observed in the primary photoreaction of microbial rhodopsins are the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity arising from the acid&#8208;base equilibrium of the amino acid residue acting as the counterion of a protonated retinal Schiff base chromophore.







Abstract
All&#8208;trans to 13&#8208;cis photoisomerization of the protonated retinal Schiff base (PRSB) chromophore is the primary step that triggers various biological functions of microbial rhodopsins. While this ultrafast primary process has been extensively studied, it has been recognized that the relevant excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics differ significantly from one rhodopsin to another. To elucidate the origin of the complicated ultrafast dynamics of the primary process in microbial rhodopsins, we studied the excited&#8208;state dynamics of proteorhodopsin, its D97N mutant, and bacteriorhodopsin by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption (TA) spectroscopy in a wide pH range. The TA data showed that their excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics drastically change when pH approaches the pKa of the counterion residue of the PRSB chromophore in the ground state. This result reveals that the varied excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics in different rhodopsins mainly originate from the difference of the ground&#8208;state heterogeneity (i.e., protonation/deprotonation of the PRSB counterion).

         <title>Cascaded Nanozyme System with High Reaction Selectivity by Substrate Screening and Channeling in a Microfluidic Device**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction selectivity of a nanozyme system was enhanced by screening and channeling of substrates. A catalytic cascade incorporating N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages with oxidase&#8208;like activity, and Prussian blue nanoparticles with peroxidase&#8208;like activity, improved reaction selectivity by more than 2000 times.







Abstract
Surpassing natural enzymes in cost, stability and mass production, nanozymes have attracted wide attention in fields from disease diagnosis to tumor therapy. However, nanozymes intrinsically have low reaction selectivity, which significantly restricts their applications. A general method is reported to address this challenge by following a biomimetic operation principle of substrates channeling and screening. Two oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymes (i.e., emerging N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages and Prussian blue nanoparticles), were cascaded as a proof of concept to improve the reaction selectivity in transforming the substrate into the targeted product by more than 2000 times. The cascaded nanozymes were also adopted to a spatially confined microfluidic device, leading to more than 100&#8208;fold enhancement of the reaction efficiency due to signal amplification.

         <dc:description>Efficient delivery of reactive and toxic gaseous reagents to organic reactions was studied using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Simultaneous cargo vehicle and catalytic capabilities of several MOFs were probed for the first time using the examples of&#160; aromatization, aminocarbonylation, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions. These reactions highlight that MOFs can serve a dual role as a gas cargo vehicle and a catalyst, &#160;leading to product formation with yields similar to reactions employing pure gases. Furthermore, the MOFs can be recycled without sacrificing product yield, while simultaneously maintaining crystallinity. The reported findings were supported crystallographically and spectroscopically (e.g.,&#160; diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), foreshadowing a pathway for the development of multifunctional MOF&#8208;based reagent&#8208;catalyst cargo vessels for reactive reagents, as an attractive alternative to the use of toxic pure gases or gas generators.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Analysis of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic crystals, although widely studied, have not been considered nascent candidate materials in the engineering design. Here we summarize the reported mechanical properties of organic crystals reported over the past three decades, and we establish a global mechanical property profile that can be used to predict and identify mechanically robust organic crystals. Being composed of light elements, organic crystals populate a narrow region in the mechanical property&#8208;density space between soft, disordered organic materials and stiff, ordered materials. Two subsets of extraordinarily stiff and hard organic crystalline materials were identified and rationalized by the normalized number density, strength and directionality of their intermolecular interactions. We conclude that the future light&#8208;weight, soft, all&#8208;organic components in devices should capitalize on the combination of long&#8208;range structural order and softness as the greatest asset of organic single crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Itaconation of Complex Peptides by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective peptide functionalization provides a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective access to diversify peptides for biological studies. Among many existing non&#8208;invasive peptide conjugations methodologies, photoredox catalysis has emerged as one of the powerful approaches for site&#8208;specific manipulation on native peptide. Herein, we report a highly N&#8208;termini&#8208;specific method to rapidly access itaconated peptides and their derivatives through a combination of transamination and photoredox conditions. This strategy exploits the facile reactivity of peptidyl&#8211;dihydropyridine in the complex peptide settings, complementing extant approaches of bioconjugations with excellent selectivity under mild conditions. Distinct from conventional methods, this method utilizes the highly reactive carbamoyl radical derived from a peptidyl&#8211;dihydropyridine. In addition, this itaconated peptide can be further functionalized as a Michael acceptor to access the corresponding peptide&#8211;protein conjugate.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a mechanism&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free tandem catalytic approach, commodity polyester plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are rapidly and selectively deconstructed by combining the two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)  4  and Pd/C, under 1 atm H  2  , affording terephthalic acid (or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid for PEN) and ethane (or butane for PBT) in essentially quantitative yield. This process is effective for both laboratory grade and waste plastics, and comingled polypropylene remains unchanged. Combined experimental and DFT mechanistic analyses indicate that Hf(OTf)  4  catalyzes a mildly exergonic retro&#8208;hydroalkoxylation reaction in which an alkoxy C&#8208;O bond is first cleaved, yielding a carboxylic acid and alkene, and this process is closely coupled to an exergonic olefin hydrogenation step, driving the overall reaction forward.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Air pollutions by SO  2  and NO  2  have caused significant risks on the environment and human health. Understanding the mechanism of active sites within capture materials is of fundamental importance to the development of new clean&#8208;up technologies. Here we report the crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO  2  and NO  2  on open Ni(II) sites in a metal&#8208;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating an unprecedented {Ni  12  }&#8208;wheel, which exhibits six open Ni(II) sites on desolvation. Immobilised gas molecules are further stabilised by cooperative  host&#8208;guest interactions  comprised of hydrogen bonds, &#960;  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960; interactions and dipole interactions. At 298 K and 1.0 bar, NKU&#8208;100 shows adsorption uptakes of 6.21 and 5.80 mmol g  &#8208;1  for SO  2  and NO  2  , respectively. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have confirmed the selective retention of SO  2  and NO  2  at low concentrations under dry conditions. This work will inspire the future design of efficient sorbents for the capture of SO  2  and NO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>The Chiral Target of Daptomycin is the 2R,2'S Stereoisomer of Phosphatidylglycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Daptomycin (dap) is an important antibiotic that interacts with the bacterial membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in a calcium&#8208;dependent manner. The enantiomer of dap (ent&#8208;dap) was synthesized and was found to be 85&#8208;fold less active than dap against B. subtilis, indicating that dap interacts with a chiral target as part of its mechanism of action. Using liposomes containing enantiopure PG, we demonstrate that the binding of dap to PG, the structural transition that occurs upon dap binding to PG, and the subsequent oligomerization of dap, depends upon the configuration of PG, and that dap prefers the 1,2&#8208;diacyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;1&#8217;&#8208;sn&#8208;glycerol stereoisomer (2R,2'S configuration). Ent&#8208;dap has a lower affinity for 2R,2'S liposomes than dap and cannot oligomerize to the same extent as dap, which accounts for why ent&#8208;dap is less active than dap. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby the activity of an antibiotic depends upon the configuration of a lipid head group.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Iron(III)&#8722;Fluoride&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26281-26286, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeIII&#8722;F (formed via ScIII activation) activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with reaction rates equivalent to or higher than FeIII&#8722;OH and FeIV=O oxidants. The driving force for fast C&#8722;H activation is ascribed to the higher bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the product formed (BDEF&#8722;H&gt;&#8811;BDEO&#8722;H).







Abstract
We anticipate high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8722;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation. We prepared a dimeric FeIII(F)&#8722;F&#8722;FeIII(F) complex (1) by reacting [FeII(NCCH3)2(TPA)](ClO4)2 (TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) with difluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane (difluoroiodobenzene). 1 was a sluggish oxidant, however, it was readily activated by reaction with Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids to yield a monomeric [FeIII(TPA)(F)(X)]+ complex (2) where X=F/OTf. 1 and 2 were characterized using NMR, EPR, UV/Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry. 2 was a remarkably reactive FeIII reagent for oxidative C&#8722;H activation, demonstrating reaction rates for hydrocarbon HAT comparable to the most reactive FeIII and FeIV oxidants.

&lt;p&gt;An Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;F (formed via Sc&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; activation) activates C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds with reaction rates equivalent to or higher than Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH and Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O oxidants. The driving force for fast C&#8722;H activation is ascribed to the higher bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the product formed (BDE&lt;sub&gt;F&#8722;H&amp;gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8811;BDE&lt;sub&gt;O&#8722;H&lt;/sub&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We anticipate high-valent metal&#8211;fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8722;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation. We prepared a dimeric Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(F)&#8722;F&#8722;Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(F) complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) by reacting [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(NCCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TPA)](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (TPA=tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine) with difluoro(phenyl)-&#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-iodane (difluoroiodobenzene). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was a sluggish oxidant, however, it was readily activated by reaction with Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids to yield a monomeric [Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(TPA)(F)(X)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) where X=F/OTf. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were characterized using NMR, EPR, UV/Vis, and FT-IR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry. &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was a remarkably reactive Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; reagent for oxidative C&#8722;H activation, demonstrating reaction rates for hydrocarbon HAT comparable to the most reactive Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; oxidants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Electrochemiluminescence Detection with Aptamer&#8208;Gated Indicator Releasing Mesoporous Nanoparticles Enables ppt Sensitivity for Strip&#8208;Based Rapid Tests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26287-26297, December 6, 2021. </description>

The best of both worlds in one strip, i.e., electrochemical excitation and luminescence emission, together with aptamer&#8208;gated hybrid nanomaterials enables the detection of penicillin directly in milk at ultra&#8208;trace levels in less than 5&#8197;min with a simple test strip and a mobile communication device.







Abstract
The combination of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) and aptamer&#8208;gated indicator delivering (gAID) magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles embedded into glass fibre paper functionalised with poly(ethyleneglycol) and N&#8208;(3&#8208;triethoxysilylpropyl)diethanolamine allowed the development of a rapid test that detects penicillin directly in diluted milk down to 50&#177;9 ppt in &lt;5&#8197;min. Covalent attachment of the aptamer &#8220;cap&#8221; to the silica scaffold enabled pore closure through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions with surface amino groups, while binding of penicillin led to a folding&#8208;up of the aptamer thus releasing the ECL reporter Ru(bpy)32+ previously loaded into the material and letting it be detected after lateral flow by a smartphone camera upon electrochemical excitation with a screen printed electrode inserted into a 3D&#8208;printed holder. The approach is simple, generic and presents advantages with respect to sensitivity, measurement uncertainty and robustness compared with conventional fluorescence or electrochemical detection, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;need analyses of challenging matrices and analytes at ultra&#8208;trace levels.

         <title>Ultrastable Cu Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Liquid Fuels by Tuning C&#8211;C Coupling with CuTi Subsurface</title>

The coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy enable electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon liquid fuels including ethanol, acetone and n&#8208;butanol with a total C2&#8208;4 faradaic efficiency of about 49&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).







Abstract
Production of multicarbon (C2+) liquid fuels is a challenging task for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, mainly limited by the stabilization of reaction intermediates and their subsequent C&#8722;C couplings. In this work, we report a unique catalyst, the coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy (a&#8208;CuTi@Cu) toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon (C2&#8208;4) liquid fuels. Remarkably, the electrocatalyst yields ethanol, acetone, and n&#8208;butanol as major products with a total C2&#8208;4 faradaic efficiency of about 49&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which can be maintained for at least 3&#8197;months. Theoretical simulations and in situ characterization reveals that subsurface Ti atoms can increase the electron density of surface Cu sites and enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediate, which in turn reduces the energy barriers required for *CO dimerization and trimerization.

         <title>CO&#8208;Tolerant PEMFC Anodes Enabled by Synergistic Catalysis between Iridium Single&#8208;Atom Sites and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26177-26183, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the synergistic effect between single&#8208;atom Ir sites and Ir nanoparticles, a novel CO&#8208;tolerating PEMFC anode catalyst (PEMFC=proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell) exhibits excellent hydrogen oxidation reaction and CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity. On this foundation, the catalyst can maintain a stable operation state in a H2/1000&#8197;ppm CO mixture.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are limited by their extreme sensitivity to trace&#8208;level CO impurities, thus setting a strict requirement for H2 purity and excluding the possibility to directly use cheap crude hydrogen as fuel. Herein, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in which a novel catalyst comprising both Ir particles and Ir single&#8208;atom sites (IrNP@IrSA&#8208;N&#8208;C) addresses the CO poisoning issue. The Ir single&#8208;atom sites are found not only to be good CO oxidizing sites, but also excel in scavenging the CO molecules adsorbed on Ir particles in close proximity, thereby enabling the Ir particles to reserve partial active sites towards H2 oxidation. The interplay between Ir nanoparticles and Ir single&#8208;atom centers confers the catalyst with both excellent H2 oxidation activity (1.19&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent CO electro&#8208;oxidation activity (85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in PEMFCs; the catalyst also tolerates CO in H2/CO mixture gas at a level that is two times better than that of the current best PtRu/C catalyst.

         <title>Smart Nanozyme Platform with Activity&#8208;Correlated Ratiometric Molecular Imaging for Predicting Therapeutic Effects</title>

A manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) is developed for real&#8208;time reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;activated cancer therapy by ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. The nanoplatform can self&#8208;monitor the activation of nanozymes during cancer therapy, which has potential to predict therapeutic effects in vivo and guide nanoenzymes in personalized cancer treatment.







Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like characteristics have attracted enormous research interest in biological application. However, there is a lack of facile approach for evaluating the catalytic activity of nanozymes in living system. Herein, we develop a novel manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) with oxidase&#8208;like activity for reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;induced cancer therapy via ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. Notably, MSPN possess oxidase&#8208;like activity in tumor microenvironment, owing to the mixed&#8208;valent MnOx nanoparticles, which can effectively kill cancer cells. Because the semiconducting polymer (PFODBT) is conjugated with oxidase&#8208;responsive molecule (ORM), the catalytic activity of nanozyme can be correlated with the ratiometric signals of NIRF (FL695/FL825) and PA (PA680/PA780), which may provide new ideas for predicting anticancer efficacy of nanozymes in living system.

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Assisted Artesunate Delivery by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Synergistic Cancer Treatment</title>

Self&#8208;assembled nanomedicine based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with hidden missing linkers shows enhanced artesunate and photosensitizer co&#8208;loading capacity. In the presence of abundant physiological HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ from MOFs activates artesunate&#8208;based oxidative death of cancer cells. Released linkers undergo a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione, contributing to synergistic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of an ATS nanomedicine through the self&#8208;assembly with Mn[Co(CN)6]2/3&#9633;1/3 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that have hidden missing linkers. The defects in MOFs originating from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co&#8208;loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO3&#8722;, Mn2+ acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate&#8208;activated H2O2 system which oxidizes ATS to generate reactive oxygen species and induce oxidative death to cancer cells. The released [CoIII(CN)6] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect&#8208;engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promise in advancing the practical use of ATS as an antitumor medicine.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Cu&#8208;Doped SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n Heterostructure That Shows Significant Raman Enhancement**

A sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF &gt;1010. SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was then developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs recorded in a barcode demonstrated practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.







Abstract
Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu), was first created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46&#215;1010. This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;separation efficacy of p&#8208;n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner&#8208;reference element, SnO2&#8208;NiOx/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs was recorded in a barcode, demonstrating practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.

         <title>Enhanced Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Recombination and Oligonucleotide Assembly in Peptide&#8208;RNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26096-26104, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, a prebiotically plausible ribozyme formed from short oligonucleotides reversibly cleaves an RNA substrate. However, in the presence of poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, phase separation occurs owing to charge interactions between the oppositely charged RNA and peptide. The resulting compartments greatly enhance ribozyme activity, driving the reaction equilibrium towards the ligation of long and complex RNA in mild conditions.







Abstract
The ability of RNA to catalyze RNA ligation is critical to its central role in many prebiotic model scenarios, in particular the copying of information during self&#8208;replication. Prebiotically plausible ribozymes formed from short oligonucleotides can catalyze reversible RNA cleavage and ligation reactions, but harsh conditions or unusual scenarios are often required to promote folding and drive the reaction equilibrium towards ligation. Here, we demonstrate that ribozyme activity is greatly enhanced by charge&#8208;mediated phase separation with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, which shifts the reaction equilibrium from cleavage in solution to ligation in peptide&#8208;RNA coaggregates and coacervates. This compartmentalization enables robust isothermal RNA assembly over a broad range of conditions, which can be leveraged to assemble long and complex RNAs from short fragments under mild conditions in the absence of exogenous activation chemistry, bridging the gap between pools of short oligomers and functional RNAs.

         <title>A DNA Molecular Robot that Autonomously Walks on the Cell Membrane to Drive Cell Motility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26087-26095, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA molecular robot that autonomously walks on the cell membrane to drive the cell motility has been developed. The DNA robot could move stepwise on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signal pathway regulation of desired cellular behavior.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular robots can execute sophisticated molecular tasks at nanometer resolution. However, a molecular robot capable of controlling cellular behavior remains unexplored. Herein, we report a self&#8208;propelled DNA robot operating on the cell membrane to control the migration of a cell. Driven by DNAzyme catalytic activity, the DNA robot could autonomously and stepwise move on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner and simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signaling for cell motility. The cell membrane&#8208;associated continuous motion and operation of a DNA robot allowed for the ultrasensitive regulation of MET/AKT signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling to enhance cell migration. Finally, we designed distinct conditional DNA robots to orthogonally manipulate the cell migration in a coculture of mixed cell populations. We have developed a novel strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;driving molecular robot, representing a promising avenue for precise cell manipulation with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Inhibition of Autophagy by a Small Molecule through Covalent Modification of the LC3 Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26105-26114, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent probe, DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5, was discovered which demonstrates high selectivity to LC3A/B in the proteome. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 inhibits autophagy by attenuating LC3B lipidation, which subsequently reduces the extent of autophagic structure formation and later substrate degradation.







Abstract
The autophagic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3&#8208;interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins, including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy.

&lt;p&gt;A potent probe, DC-LC3in-D5, was discovered which demonstrates high selectivity to LC3A/B in the proteome. DC-LC3in-D5 inhibits autophagy by attenuating LC3B lipidation, which subsequently reduces the extent of autophagic structure formation and later substrate degradation.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance 3D K+&#8208;Pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene for Potassium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors via Regulating Electrolyte Solvation Structure</title>

A 3D K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene with a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formed on its surface was employed as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors with high power density and superior cycling stability. This work offers a new insight into design of MXene&#8208;based anode material and the relationship between solvation structure and SEI formation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance anode materials for potassium&#8208;based energy storage devices with long&#8208;term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. A three&#8208;dimensional K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene with enlarged interlayer distance was constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium&#8208;ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K+&#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti3C2Tx electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K+&#8208;Ti3C2Tx//activated carbon (AC) potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) were assembled, which exhibited promising electrochemical performances. These results highlight the significant roles of both rational structure design and electrolyte optimization for highly reactive MXene&#8208;based anode materials in energy storage devices.

         <title>Sequential Selective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P Bond Functionalizations: An Entry to Bioactive Arylated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26199-26209, December 6, 2021. </description>

A broadly unified, straightforward method of direct sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;P bond functionalization has been developed to access a variety of synthetically and highly useful bioactive benzhydrylamine, benzhydrylthioether, and triarylmethane motifs from commercially available arenes and simple aldehydes.







Abstract
Organophosphonium salts containing C(sp3)&#8722;+P bonds are among the most utilized reagents in organic synthesis for constructing C&#8722;C double bonds. However, their use as C&#8208;selective electrophilic groups is rare. Here, we explore an efficient and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for sequential chemo&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;+P bond functionalizations. In the present study, C&#8722;H alkylation resulting in the synthesis of benzhydryl triarylphosphonium salts was achieved by one&#8208;pot, four&#8208;component cross&#8208;coupling reactions of simple and commercially available starting materials. The utility of the resulting phosphonium salt building blocks was demonstrated by the chemoselective post&#8208;functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;+PPh3 groups to achieve aminations, thiolations, and arylations. In this way, benzhydrylamines, benzhydrylthioethers, and triarylmethanes, structural motifs that are present in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, are readily accessed. These include the synthesis of two anticancer agents from simple materials in only two to three steps. Additionally, a protocol for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive drugs has been developed using benzhydrylphosphonium salts. This new approach should provide novel transformations for application in both academic and pharmaceutical research.

         <title>Terpolymerization of Ethylene and Two Different Methoxyaryl&#8208;Substituted Propylenes by Scandium Catalyst Makes Tough and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Elastomers</title>

The sequence&#8208;controlled terpolymers of ethylene and two different methoxyaryl&#8208;functionalized propylenes synthesized with a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst exhibited excellent elasticity and remarkable self&#8208;healing because of the unique synergistic effects of the multiple components.







Abstract
The terpolymerization of a non&#8208;polar olefin (such as ethylene) and two different polar functional olefins in a controlled fashion is of great interest and importance but has hardly been explored to date. We report for the first time the terpolymerization of ethylene (E) and two different methoxyaryl&#8208;substituted propylenes (AR1P=hexylanisyl propylene; AR2P=methoxynaphthyl propylene or methoxypyrenyl propylene) by a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. The terpolymerization took place in a sequence&#8208;controlled fashion, affording unique multi&#8208;block copolymers composed of two different ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methoxyarylpropylene sequences E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR1P (soft segments) and E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR2P (hard segments) and relatively short ethylene&#8211;ethylene (EE) blocks (crystalline segments). The terpolymers exhibited excellent elasticity and unprecedented self&#8208;healing as a result of microphase separation of nanodomains of the crystalline EE segments and the hard amorphous E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR2P segments from a very flexible E&#8208;alt&#8208;AR1P matrix, demonstrating unique synergy of the three different components.

         <title>Multifunctional Deformable Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals</title>

A bendable single crystal of an organic semiconductor is reported that can be used as phototransistor, photoswitch and a waveguide. The material exists as two polymorphs with distinct elastic or plastic mechanical properties and can be switched by heating. The crystals are optically conductive in the near&#8208;infrared and can be used as optical waveguides in the telecommunications range.







Abstract
We report the first organic semiconductor crystal with a unique combination of properties that can be used as a multifunctional optoelectronic device. Mechanically flexible single crystals of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) can function as a phototransistor, photoswitch, and an optical waveguide. The material can exist as two structurally different solid phases, with single crystals of one of the phases being elastic at room temperature while those of the other are brittle and become plastic at higher temperature. The output and transfer characteristics of the devices were characterized by measuring the generation and temporal response of the switching of the photogenerated current. The current&#8211;voltage characteristics of both phases exhibit linearity and symmetry about the positive and negative voltages.

     alt="Multifunctional Deformable Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bendable single crystal of an organic semiconductor is reported that can be used as phototransistor, photoswitch and a waveguide. The material exists as two polymorphs with distinct elastic or plastic mechanical properties and can be switched by heating. The crystals are optically conductive in the near-infrared and can be used as optical waveguides in the telecommunications range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the first organic semiconductor crystal with a unique combination of properties that can be used as a multifunctional optoelectronic device. Mechanically flexible single crystals of 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) can function as a phototransistor, photoswitch, and an optical waveguide. The material can exist as two structurally different solid phases, with single crystals of one of the phases being elastic at room temperature while those of the other are brittle and become plastic at higher temperature. The output and transfer characteristics of the devices were characterized by measuring the generation and temporal response of the switching of the photogenerated current. The current&#8211;voltage characteristics of both phases exhibit linearity and symmetry about the positive and negative voltages. The crystals transmit light in the telecommunications range with significantly low optical loss for an organic crystalline material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NBN&#8208;Doped Bis&#8208;Tetracene and Peri&#8208;Tetracene: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26115-26121, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel double NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged nanographenes, bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT), are achieved through a combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The chemical structures are clearly characterized by STM and AFM. Moreover, NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT can be further tailored to dications, which demonstrate similar electronic properties to their all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based isoelectronic structures bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene.







Abstract
Combining solution&#8208;based and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis, we demonstrate the first synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped bis&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;BT) and peri&#8208;tetracene (NBN&#8208;PT). The chemical structures are clearly elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) characterizations reveal that NBN&#8208;BT and NBN&#8208;PT possess higher energy gaps than bis&#8208;tetracene and peri&#8208;tetracene. Interestingly, NBN&#8208;BT can undergo stepwise one&#8208;electron oxidation and convert into its corresponding radical cation and then to its dication. The energy gap of the NBN&#8208;BT dication is similar to that of bis&#8208;tetracene, indicating their isoelectronic relationship. Moreover, a similar energy gap between the NBN&#8208;PT dication and peri&#8208;tetracene can be predicted by DFT calculations. This work provides a novel synthesis along with characterizations of multi&#8208;NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged peri&#8208;acenes with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Assembled Film from Semiconductor Nanorods with Ultra&#8208;Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

Achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods were assembled into chiral films using the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. The CdSe/CdS nanorods films displayed intense circular dichroism response and circularly polarized luminescence signals, which can be adjusted by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers.







Abstract
Chiroptical nanomaterials have generated significant levels of interest for generating strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. We used the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique to generate the continuous and compact assembly of CdSe/CdS chiral film. We assembled achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers. This allowed us to tailor chiroptical properties to achieve high CPL signals. The chiral film was symmetrical and had the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and CPL signals with ten layers (RH (right&#8208;handed)&#8208;/LH (left&#8208;handed)&#8208;5 + 5 layers) and a 45&#176; inter&#8208;angle. Specifically, RH&#8208;5+5 of the chiral film exhibited 1431 mdeg of CD activity and strong CPL signals with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.0997. The helical stacked crystal plates with linear birefringence resulted in strong circular birefringence, as determined by the Reusch model. Electromagnetic simulations indicated that such remarkable optical activity was attributed to the birefringence and dichroism of the well&#8208;aligned CdSe/CdS nanorod layers in the chiral films. Under right/left circular polarized (RCP/LCP) light excitation, the well aligned semiconductor nanorods exhibited differences in the coupling efficiencies to RCP and LCP light. Our CdSe/CdS chiral films, which exhibit ultra&#8208;strong CPL activity, will provide a novel strategy for the fabrication of chiroptical devices.

         <title>Site&#8208;Fixed Hydroboration of Terminal and Internal Alkenes using BX3/iPr2NEt**
</title>

A novel and general method for the hydroboration of alkenes, including aryl alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, aliphatic alkenes, and bio&#8208;derived alkenes, using BX3 as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The reaction was also applied to the synthesis of linear and branched 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes. The reaction is thought to proceed by a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general hydroboration of alkenes with BX3 (X=Br, Cl) as the boration reagent in the presence of iPr2NEt is reported. The addition of iPr2NEt not only suppresses alkene polymerization and haloboration side reactions but also provides an &#8220;H&#8221; source for hydroboration. More importantly, the site&#8208;fixed installation of a boryl group at the original position of the internal double bond is readily achieved in contrast to conventional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration processes. Further application to the synthesis of 1,n&#8208;diborylalkanes (n=3&#8211;10) is also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a major reaction pathway that involves radical species and operates through a frustrated Lewis pair type single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8211;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26080-26086, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic capability of squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases to convert (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;substrates enantiospecifically to (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;configurated monocyclic terpenoids was put into action by a combination of enzyme evolution and substrate engineering for the synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone with &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC&#8208;wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (AciSHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (E/Z)&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed AciSHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)&#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99&#8201;% ee), the (E)&#8208;isomer was converted to the (S,S)&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95&#8201;% ee). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9&#8201;% ee) could be obtained.

&lt;p&gt;Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)-enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio-complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC-wild-type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (&lt;i&gt;Aci&lt;/i&gt;SHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)-&#947;-dihydroionone from (E/Z)-geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed &lt;i&gt;Aci&lt;/i&gt;SHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)-isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)-&#947;-dihydroionone (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;), the (E)-isomer was converted to the (S,S)-bicyclic ether (&amp;gt;95&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC-substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)-&#947;-dihydroionone (&amp;gt;99.9&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) could be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerizations to prepare polypeptides, which can proceed ultrafast in open vessels, aqueous environments and using crude NCAs.







Abstract
We design the tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated superfast polymerization on &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCA) for efficient synthesis of polypeptides. Carboxylates, as a new class of initiator for NCA polymerization, can initiate the superfast NCA polymerization without the need of extra catalysts and the polymerization can be operated in open vessels at ambient condition without the use of glove box. Tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated polymerization on NCA easily affords block copolymers with at least 15 blocks. Moreover, this method avoids tedious purification steps and enables direct polymerization on crude NCAs in aqueous environments to prepare polypeptides and one&#8208;pot synthesis of polypeptide nanoparticles. These advantages and the mild polymerization condition of tetraalkylammonium carboxylate&#8208;initiated NCA polymerization imply its great potential in functional exploration and application of polypeptides.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Templating Growth of Homeostatic GeP Nano&#8208;Bar Corals with Fast Electron&#8208;Ion Transportation Pathways for High Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

An in situ template method is proposed to directionally induce the construction of corals of GeP nanobars featuring high aspect ratio, plentiful exposed facets for rapid Li+ transport, and a self&#8208;healable homeostatic ability to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability.







Abstract
We propose an in situ template method to directionally induce the construction of germanium phosphide nanobar (GeP&#8208;nb) corals with an adjustable aspect ratio. The GeP nanobars grown onto conductive matrix with high aspect ratio expose more quickest electron&#8208;ion transportation facets for fast reaction dynamics. The customized GeP&#8208;nb electrode delivers a self&#8208;healable homeostatic behavior by reversibly stabilizing GeP crystalline structure through multi&#8208;phase reactions to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability (850&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles). As a result, the GeP&#8208;nb presents the highest Li+ diffusion coefficient (6.21&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) among all the Ge&#8208;based anode materials studied so far, rendering an excellent rate performance (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) as a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anode.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into Iron(II) Bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;Bipyridine Skeleton for Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26072-26079, December 6, 2021. </description>

A polypyridine Fe&#8208;based skeleton is reported for selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction even under 1&#8201;% CO2. Mechanistic insights reveal two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with delocalized electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO2 addition. Proton&#8208;assisted CO formation is crucial for CO2 reduction. A pendant, proton&#8208;shuttling &#945;&#8208;OH group switches the transformation to H2 exclusively, which enables self&#8208;sorting syngas formation at flexible CO/H2 ratios.







Abstract
A bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;iron(II) framework (Fe(BPAbipy)) of complexes 1&#8211;3 is reported to shed light on the multistep nature of CO2 reduction. Herein, photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO even at low CO2 concentration (1&#8201;%), together with detailed mechanistic study and DFT calculations, reveal that 1 first undergoes two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO2 binding over proton. The following 2&#8201;H+&#8208;assisted Fe&#8208;CO formation is rate&#8208;determining for selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction. A pendant, proton&#8208;shuttling &#945;&#8208;OH group (2) initiates PCET for predominant H2 evolution, while an &#945;&#8208;OMe group (3) cancels the selectivity control for either CO or H2. The near&#8208;unity selectivity of 1 and 2 enables self&#8208;sorting syngas production at flexible CO/H2 ratios. The unprecedented results from one kind of molecular catalyst skeleton encourage insight into the beauty of advanced multi&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;proton transfer processes for robust CO2RR by photocatalysis.

         <title>Predesign of Catalytically Active Sites via Stable Coordination Cluster Model System for Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26210-26217, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular model catalyst system (Cu3&#8208;X) with predesigned catalytically active sites has been constructed to achieve the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4. The active Cu sites display an appropriate spatial distance, resulting in high faradaic efficiencies.







Abstract
Purposefully designing the well&#8208;defined catalysts for the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 is an extremely important but challenging work. In this work, three crystalline trinuclear copper clusters (Cu3&#8208;X, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) have been designed, containing three active Cu sites with the identical coordination environment and appropriate spatial distance, delivering high selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4. The highest faradaic efficiency of Cu3&#8208;X for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion can be adjusted from 31.90&#8201;% to 55.01&#8201;% by simply replacing the counter anions (NO3&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). The DFT calculation results verify that Cu3&#8208;X can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling of identical *CHO intermediates, subsequently forming molecular symmetrical C2H4 product. This work provides an important molecular model system and a new design perspective for electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products with symmetrical molecular structure.

The highest faradaic efficiency of &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-X&lt;/b&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion can be adjusted from 31.90&#8201;% to 55.01&#8201;% by simply replacing the counter anions (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). The DFT calculation results verify that &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-X&lt;/b&gt; can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling of identical *CHO intermediates, subsequently forming molecular symmetrical C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; product. This work provides an important molecular model system and a new design perspective for electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products with symmetrical molecular structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Is Organic Chemistry Really Growing Exponentially?</title>

The number of reaction examples increases exponentially but the number of new reaction types grows only linearly or sub&#8208;linearly. We re&#8208;use the most familiar and popular reaction classes although we also discover more complex transformations. Analysis of reaction&#8208;type dynamics is useful to estimate numbers of meaningful machine&#8208;learning models that can be constructed and for tracing suspicious/erroneous entries in databases.







Abstract
In terms of molecules and specific reaction examples, organic chemistry features an impressive, exponential growth. However, new reaction classes/types that fuel this growth are being discovered at a much slower and only linear (or even sublinear) rate. The proportion of newly discovered reaction types to all reactions being performed keeps decreasing, suggesting that synthetic chemistry becomes more reliant on reusing the well&#8208;known methods. The newly discovered chemistries are more complex than decades ago and allow for the rapid construction of complex scaffolds in fewer numbers of steps. We study these and other trends in the function of time, reaction&#8208;type popularity and complexity based on the algorithm that extracts generalized reaction class templates. These analyses are useful in the context of computer&#8208;assisted synthesis, machine learning (to estimate the numbers of models with sufficient reaction statistics), and identifying erroneous entries in reaction databases.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Enzymatic Labeling Reveals a Critical Role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in Cell&#8208;Cycle Progression and DNA Damage Response</title>

A galactosyltransferase was engineered to covalently modify the O&#8208;GlcNAc glycan with a biotinylated sugar, allowing for the sensitive capture and profiling of cellular O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins. This strategy identifies flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) as a novel glycoprotein. O&#8208;GlcNAc glycosylation on FEN1 abolishes its interaction with PCNA during DNA replication, leading to aberrant cell&#8208;cycle progression and defects in DNA damage response.







Abstract
O&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification of proteins that is essential for cell function. Perturbation of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation leads to altered cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we develop a highly sensitive one&#8208;step enzymatic strategy for capture and profiling O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins in cells. Using this strategy, we discover that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), an essential enzyme in DNA synthesis, is a novel substrate for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation. FEN1 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle. O&#8208;GlcNAcylation at the serine 352 of FEN1 disrupts its interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) at the replication foci, and leads to altered cell cycle, defects in DNA replication, accumulation of DNA damage, and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Thus, our study provides a sensitive method for profiling O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins, and reveals an unknown mechanism of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage response.

         <title>Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Ag15 Nanocluster with Atomic Precision: Structural Analysis and Electrocatalytic Performance toward CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26136-26141, December 6, 2021. </description>

The smallest all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected silver superatom, Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ has an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure. It can adsorb CO2 in the air and exhibits high activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, with FE reaching 95&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. DFT calculations show that the under&#8208;coordinated Ag atom on Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one ligand releasing from the cluster surface is the active species.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)12+ (abbreviated as Ag15) nanocluster and its electrocatalytic properties toward CO2 reduction reaction. Crystal structure analysis reveals that Ag15 possesses a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure with an Ag@Ag8@Ag6 metal core configuration. Interestingly, we found that Ag15 can adsorb CO2 in the air and spontaneously self&#8208;assembled into one&#8208;dimensional linear material during the crystal growth process. Furthermore, Ag15 can convert CO2 into CO with a faradaic efficiency of ca. 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V and a maximal turnover frequency of 6.37&#8197;s&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V along with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclosed that Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8208;tBu)11+ with one alkynyl ligand stripping off from the intact cluster can expose the uncoordinated Ag atom as the catalytically active site for CO formation.

         <title>Heavily Tungsten&#8208;Doped Sodium Thioantimonate Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Exceptionally Low Activation Energy for Ionic Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26158-26166, December 6, 2021. </description>

A multi&#8208;mechanistic strategy for tailoring the composition of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed. Both exhibit exceptionally low activation energies and enhanced room&#8208;temperature (RT) ionic conductivities; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm, respectively.







Abstract
A strategy for modifying the structure of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W&#8208;doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 and Na2.7W0.3Sb0.7S4 are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm. At &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C the Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5&#8197;mS/cm. The 30&#8201;% W content goes far beyond the 10&#8211;12&#8201;% reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo&#8208;cubic or orthorhombic structures. Calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na&#8208;ions. An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) using Na2.895W0.3Sb0.7S4 as the primary SSE and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 400&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy for modifying the structure of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) to reduce the cation diffusion activation energy is presented. Two heavily W-doped sodium thioantimonate SSEs, Na&lt;sub&gt;2.895&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;2.7&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are designed, both exhibiting exceptionally low activation energy and enhanced room temperature (RT) ionic conductivity; 0.09&#8197;eV, 24.2&#8197;mS/cm and 0.12&#8197;eV, 14.5&#8197;mS/cm. At &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C the Na&lt;sub&gt;2.895&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; displays a total ionic conductivity of 5.5&#8197;mS/cm. The 30&#8201;% W content goes far beyond the 10&#8211;12&#8201;% reported in the prior studies, and results in novel pseudo-cubic or orthorhombic structures. Calculations reveal that these properties result from a combination of multiple diffusion mechanisms, including vacancy defects, strongly correlated modes and excessive Na-ions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Organic Framework in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26268-26275, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework is realized by hierarchical assembly in water. The coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligand to the zinc porphyrin subunits of a monolayer supramolecular network has been utilized to selectively produce ordered bilayer supramolecular architectures with controlled thickness.







Abstract
Accurate control of the layer number of orderly stacked 2D polymers has been an unsettled challenge in self&#8208;assembly. Herein we describe the fabrication of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework from a monolayer 2D supramolecular organic framework in water by utilizing the cooperative coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligands to zinc porphyrin subunits of the monolayer network. The monolayer supramolecular framework is prepared from the co&#8208;assembly of an octacationic zinc porphyrin monomer and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in water through CB[8]&#8208;encapsulation&#8208;promoted dimerization of 4&#8208;phenylpyridiunium subunits that the zinc porphyrin monomer bear. The bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework exhibits structural regularity in both solution and the solid state, which is characterized by synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques. Atomic force microscopic imaging confirms that the bilayer character of the 2D supramolecular organic framework can be realized selectively on the micrometer scale.

         <title>Interfacial Super&#8208;Assembly of Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Silica/AAO Hybrid Membrane with Enhanced Permselectivity for Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Sensitive Smart Ion Transport</title>

The synthesis of a mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anode alumina oxide (MCS/AAO) hybrid membrane by interfacial super&#8208;assembly is reported. The MCS/AAO hybrid membrane with enhanced permselectivity exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior and superior temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;sensitive salinity gradient energy conversion performance.







Abstract
Nanofluidic devices have been widely used for diode&#8208;like ion transport and salinity gradients energy conversion. Emerging reverse electrodialysis (RED) nanofluidic systems based on nanochannel membrane display great superiority in salinity gradient energy harvesting. However, the imbalance between permeability and selectivity limits their practical application. Here, a new mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anodized aluminum (MCS/AAO) nanofluidic device with enhanced permselectivity for temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated energy generation was obtained by interfacial super&#8208;assembly method. A maximum power density of 5.04&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved, and a higher performance can be obtained by regulating temperature and pH. Theoretical calculations are further implemented to reveal the mechanism for ion rectification, ion selectivity and energy conversion. Results show that the MCS/AAO hybrid membrane has great superiority in diode&#8208;like ion transport, temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated salinity gradient energy conversion.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Vicinal Difunctionalization of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes with Dual Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26184-26191, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis was developed involving coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal difunctionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes. The reaction is site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral, tolerating air, moisture and a broad scope of functional groups, which makes this method attractive for modular synthesis of complex heteroarene&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
A new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is reported involving the selective coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal double C&#8208;H functionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes in a site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The key is to use alkynyl bromides as the second electrophile, which allows vicinal difunctionalization of a wide range of heteroarenes including pyrroles, thiophenes and furans at their C4 and C5 positions. One&#8208; or two&#8208;step tetrafunctionalizations of simple pyrrole and thiophene have also been realized. The C2&#8208;substituted NBEs prove most effective in these reactions, and the mechanistic exploration discloses the origin of the high selectivity of this transformation. Synthetic utility of this method has been exemplified in the concise preparations of thiophene&#8208;containing organic materials and a protein kinase inhibitor analogue. Preliminary success has also been achieved in a direct annulation event, using a tethered ketone as the second electrophile.

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26054-26062, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active and robust single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was developed for CO oxidation by tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ through thermal&#8208;shock synthesis (see picture). Ultrafast shockwaves in an inert atmosphere generated Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration, resulting in greatly enhanced low&#8208;temperature activity that was retained under oxidizing conditions.







Abstract
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst formed by atom trapping (AT, 800&#8201;&#176;C in air) shows excellent thermal stability but is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures owing to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt2+ in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt1O4 coordination environment. Reductive activation to form Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity; however, the NPs are easily oxidized, leading to drastic activity loss. Herein we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ by thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt;1200&#8201;&#176;C) in an inert atmosphere induced surface reconstruction of CeO2 to generate Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration. Owing to this unique coordination, Pt1&#948;+ in a partially reduced state dynamically evolves during CO oxidation, resulting in exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt1/CeO2_TS catalyst was retained under oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26233-26237, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based materials have been extensively explored in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to formate, but reaching high selectivity and durability at large current densities remains challenging. Here, a catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy was formed in situ through dynamic restructuring of Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers, leading to an excellent CO2 to formate performance over a wide potential window.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. Herein, we demonstrate that Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanoflowers can undergo in situ dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO2RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S&#8208;doping and Cu&#8208;alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H2 pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy for electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for the design of active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry combines semiconductors with biocatalysts for selective chemical synthesis powered by sunlight, but the overall energy conversion efficiency of these hybrid systems has remained limited to date. In their Communication on page&#8197;26303, Erwin Reisner and co&#8208;workers report the control of the local environment of a formate dehydrogenase integrated in a hierarchical porous TiO2 scaffold. Its coupling to a lead halide perovskite&#8211;BiVO4 tandem light absorber enabled a solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission radiation (RASER) is the version of lasers and masers operating in the radiofrequency spectral range. In their Communication on page&#8197;26298, Eduard&#8197;Y. Chekmenev and co&#8208;workers employ 61&#8197;MHz proton RASER to demonstrate robust background&#8208;free detection of biomolecular NMR resonances even in the extreme cases of fully protonated solvents and biological fluids. This approach paves the way to a wide range of high&#8208;resolution NMR and in&#8197;vivo MRI applications of background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized molecules.

A DNA molecular robot autonomously walking on a cell membrane to drive cell motility has been developed. The DNA robot can autonomously and stepwise locomote on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner to simultaneously trigger receptor dimerization to activate downstream signal pathways regulating desired cellular behavior, as reported by Hong&#8208;Hui Wang, Zhou Nie, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;26087.

Sperm whale derived ambergris has historically been valued for its distinctive olfactory properties. Today, synthetic routes toward the contained (S)&#8208;y&#8208;dihydroionone and its optical antipode, emitting a floral orris&#8208;type odor, are of interest to the fragrance industry. In their Research Article on page&#8197;26080, Rebecca Buller et&#8197;al. employ engineered squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases for the monocyclization of geometric geranylacetone isomers into y&#8208;dihydroionone antipodes.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Molecules or Semiconductors in Photocatalysis?</title>

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for the rational engineering of tailored physical properties. Nevertheless, the molecular and porous nature of MOFs leaves the field juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. This Review reflects on how MOFs can resemble conventional semiconductors and how they are more like infinite molecules in solution.







Abstract
In the realm of solids, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer unique possibilities for the rational engineering of tailored physical properties. These derive from the modular, molecular make&#8208;up of MOFs, which allows for the selection and modification of the organic and inorganic building units that construct them. The adaptable properties make MOFs interesting materials for photocatalysis, an area of increasing significance. But the molecular and porous nature of MOFs leaves the field, in some areas, juxtapositioned between semiconductor physics and homogeneous photocatalysis. While descriptors from both fields are applied in tandem, the gap between theory and experiment has widened in some areas, and arguably needs fixing. Here we review where MOFs have been shown to be similar to conventional semiconductors in photocatalysis, and where they have been shown to be more like infinite molecules in solution. We do this from the perspective of band theory, which in the context of photocatalysis, covers both the molecular and nonmolecular principles of relevance.

Abstract
Atropisomeric molecules have found proven applications and have shown promising potential in chemistry and medicine. The design of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed reactions to construct atropisomerically enriched molecules has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. These reactions include kinetic resolutions, asymmetric desymmetrizations, central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversions, and cycloadditions. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in NHC&#8208;based organic catalysis for access to atropisomers, and briefly states our personal perspectives on the future advancement of this topic. NHC catalysis has provided rich and unique reaction modes that have led to success in the asymmetric synthesis of central&#8208;chiral molecules. It is expected that similar success could also be achieved in developing NHC catalysis to prepare atropisomeric molecules, including those not easily accessible by other methods.

Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) was employed for background&#8208;free detection of hyperpolarized NMR resonances even in the extreme case of protonated solvents and biological fluids. This approach paves the way to a wide range of high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208; and in&#8197;vivo MRI applications of proton detection of hyperpolarized molecules.







Abstract
We report on the utility of Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) for background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized biomolecules. We performed hyperpolarization of &#8776;0.3&#8197;M ethyl acetate via pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl acetate. A proton NMR signal with signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 100&#8201;000 was detected without radio&#8208;frequency excitation at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4&#8197;T using a standard (non&#8208;cryogenic) inductive detector with quality factor of Q=68. No proton background signal was observed from protonated solvent (methanol) or other added co&#8208;solvents such as ethanol, water or bovine serum. Moreover, we demonstrate RASER detection without radio&#8208;frequency excitation of a bolus of hyperpolarized contrast agent in biological fluid. Completely background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized contrast agents in biological media paves the way to new applications in the areas of high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vivo spectroscopy and imaging.

         <title>An NADPH&#8208;Dependent Ketoreductase Catalyses the Tetracyclic to Pentacyclic Skeletal Rearrangement in Chartreusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26378-26384, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rearrangement from the tetracyclic to the pentacyclic compound in the biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic chartreusin is very concise and only requires two redox enzymes. ChaZ mediates a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation to give a lactone intermediate. Subsequently, ChaE catalyses an unusual ketoreduction on an ester carbonyl group to give an acetal moiety, followed by a series of spontaneous reaction to construct the pentacyclic compound.







Abstract
Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type&#8197;II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early 13C&#8208;labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven&#8208;membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and affords the &#945;&#8208;pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH&#8208;dependent manner via tandem reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol&#8208;type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;&#8208;lactone ring formation, oxidation and aromatization. Our work reveals an unprecedented function of a ketoreductase that contributes to generate structural complexity of aromatic polyketide.

&lt;p&gt;The rearrangement from the tetracyclic to the pentacyclic compound in the biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic chartreusin is very concise and only requires two redox enzymes. ChaZ mediates a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation to give a lactone intermediate. Subsequently, ChaE catalyses an unusual ketoreduction on an ester carbonyl group to give an acetal moiety, followed by a series of spontaneous reaction to construct the pentacyclic compound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type&#8197;II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin-dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven-membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and affords the &#945;-pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH-dependent manner via tandem reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol-type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;-lactone ring formation, oxidation and aromatization.

A radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino migration from the oxygen centre of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon centre to achieve valuable fluoroalkyl/functionality&#8208;containing primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;aminoketones has been developed. This migration is triggered by the fluoroalkyl/functional radical which is derived from the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex of its precursor with quinuclidine.







Abstract
A novel radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino shift from the oxygen center of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon center to achieve high value&#8208;added fluoroalkyl&#8208;containing primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones is reported. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration is triggered by the alkene addition of fluoroalkyl radical derived from the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex of Togni's reagent II or fluoroalkyl iodides and quinuclidine, and involves a unique 5(6)&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the N&#8208;atom of ketoxime ethers followed by a cascade sequence of N&#8722;O bond cleavage and dehydrogenation. Notably, besides Togni's reagent II and fluoroalkyl iodides, this protocol is also compatible with other radical precursors to provide various functionalized primary aminoketones.

Formate dehydrogenase was interfaced with a perovskite to produce a photocathode that benefits from an optimized local enzyme environment via the electrolyte solution and achieves an unprecedented current density. Combination with a BiVO4 water oxidation photoanode gave a bias&#8208;free biophotoelectrochemical tandem leaf with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry can combine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic light&#8208;absorbers with enzymes evolved for selective fuel&#8208;forming reactions such as CO2 reduction, but the overall performance of such hybrid systems has been limited to date. Here, the electrolyte constituents were first tuned to establish an optimal local environment for a W&#8208;formate dehydrogenase to perform electrocatalysis. The CO2 reductase was then interfaced with a triple cation lead mixed&#8208;halide perovskite through a hierarchically structured porous TiO2 scaffold to produce an integrated photocathode achieving a photocurrent density of &#8722;5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode during simulated solar light irradiation. Finally, the combination with a water&#8208;oxidizing BiVO4 photoanode produced a bias&#8208;free integrated biophotoelectrochemical tandem device (semi&#8208;artificial leaf) with a solar CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate energy conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

Determination of the solution We synthesized a new anisotropic alignment media, p&#8208;4&#8208;AM, that is compatible with water and reusable. P&#8208;4&#8208;AM was characterized with strychnine hydrochloride as a model compound and used to determine the solution conformation of a cyclic peptide. This alignment media will increase the use of residual dipolar couplings (RDC) in structure&#8208;based drug design by enabling the identification of minor solution conformations in water.







Abstract
Determination of the solution conformation of both small organic molecules and peptides in water remains a substantial hurdle in using NMR solution conformations to guide drug design due to the lack of easy to use alignment media. Herein we report the design of a flexible compressible chemically cross&#8208;linked poly&#8208;4&#8208;acrylomorpholine gel that can be used for the alignment of both small molecules and cyclic peptides in water. To test the new gel, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and J&#8208;coupling constants were used in the configurational analysis of strychnine hydrochloride, a molecule that has been studied extensively in organic solvents as well as a small cyclic peptide that is known to form an &#945;&#8208;helix in water. The conformational ensembles for each molecule with the best fit to the data are reported. Identification of minor conformers in water that cannot easily be determined by conventional NOE measurements will facilitate the use of RDC experiments in structure&#8208;based drug design.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>

The prediction of the activity of a large nano&#8208;catalyst is a challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we developed a theoretical model to build the dependence of activity on generalized coordination number based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In the application on Cu catalytic WGS reaction, the apparent activation energy predicted by our simple model is in close agreement with experiments for particles up to 1000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
For the activity of a nano&#8208;catalyst, a general and quantitative solution to building direct structure&#8211;reactivity relationship has not yet been established. On top of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we developed a model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity. We applied this model to study the nano effects of Cu catalysts in the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for catalysts with sizes over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional KMC simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic catalyst with size of 877&#8197;nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might be expected. The present model is expected to be useful for systems that are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes.

Electrophilic fluorination of alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida species proceeds through bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type rearrangement.







Abstract
The electrophilic fluorination of geminal alkyl substituted vinyl&#8208;Bmida derivatives proceeds via bora&#8208;Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. According to DFT modelling studies this rearrangement occurs with a low activation barrier via a bora&#8208;cyclopropane shaped TS. The Bmida group has a larger migration aptitude than the alkyl moiety in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement of the presented electrophilic fluorination reactions.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Substitution with Copper(I) Homoenolates Generated from Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26351-26356, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with NHC&#8208;stabilized copper(I) homoenolates generated from cyclopropanols is developed that affords &#947;&#8208;chiral ketones in excellent regio&#8208; and high enantioselectivities. This process enables the generation of chiral quaternary carbon centers and features a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
By using copper(I) homoenolates as nucleophiles, which are generated through the ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols, a catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with allyl phosphates is achieved in high to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Both 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols and allylic phosphates enjoy broad substrate scopes. Remarkably, various functional groups, such as ether, ester, tosylate, imide, alcohol, nitro, and carbamate are well tolerated. Moreover, the present method is nicely extended to the asymmetric construction of quaternary carbon centers. Some control experiments argue against a radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism and a catalytic cycle based on a two&#8208;electron process is proposed. Finally, the synthetic utilities of the product are showcased by means of the transformations of the terminal olefin group and the ketone group.

         <title>Versatile Polymer Nanocapsules via Redox Competition</title>

Monodisperse and tunable polymer nanocapsules are synthesized via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules, dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. This streamlined method not only provides functional nanocapsules, but also enables the facile accommodation of functional cores for yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures, expediting the development of multifunctional nanosystems.







Abstract
Polymer nanocapsules have demonstrated significant value in materials science and biomedical technology, but require complicated and time&#8208;consuming synthetic steps. We report here the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymer nanocapsules via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules: dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol (BDT). Specifically, BDT forms core templates and modulates the oxidation kinetics of dopamine into polydopamine (PDA) shells. These uniform nanoparticles can be tuned between &#8776;70 and 200&#8197;nm because the core diameter directly depends on BDT while the shell thickness depends on dopamine. The supramolecular core can then rapidly disassemble in organic solvents to produce PDA nanocapsules. Such nanocapsules exhibit enhanced physicochemical performance (e.g., loading capacity, photothermal transduction, and anti&#8208;oxidation) versus their solid counterparts. Particularly, this method enables a straightforward encapsulation of functional nanoparticles providing opportunities for designing complex nanostructures such as yolk&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Ammonia from Its Elements Down to Atmospheric Pressure</title>

Mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis over Fe catalysts promoted by alkali metals, especially Rb or Cs, is possible under ball milling. The reaction proceeds at appreciable rates at room&#8208;temperature and down to atmospheric pressure in a continuously operating system under gas flow.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis via the high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure Haber&#8208;Bosch process is one of the most important chemical processes in the world. In spite of numerous attempts over the last 100&#8197;years, continuous Haber&#8208;Bosch type ammonia synthesis at room&#8208;temperature had not been possible, yet. We report the development of a mechanocatalytic system operating continuously at room&#8208;temperature and at pressures down to 1&#8197;bar. With optimized experimental conditions, a cesium&#8208;promoted iron catalyst was shown to produce ammonia at concentrations of more than 0.2&#8197;vol.&#8201;% for over 50&#8197;hours.

         <title>A General Strategy for Instantaneous and Continuous Synthesis of Ultrasmall Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26390-26396, December 6, 2021. </description>

A series of ultrasmall MOF nanoparticles could be instantaneously synthesized in a continuous way by a facile and universal strategy with the aid of high gravity intensification technology. This approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs. The as&#8208;prepared ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for the Knoevenagel reaction.







Abstract
Ultrasmall metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) may generate unique properties to expand the scope of applications. However, the synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high&#8208;gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94&#8201;% or 75&#8201;% compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large&#8208;scale.

         <title>Photochemical Organocatalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Conjugate Addition of Allyl Groups to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26373-26377, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is disclosed. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then stereoselectively intercepted with high &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, complete chemoselectivity, and moderate to good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of allyl groups to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The chemistry exploits the visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitation of chiral iminium ions to activate allyl silanes towards the formation of allylic radicals, which are then intercepted stereoselectively. The underlying radical mechanism of this process overcomes the poor regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity that traditionally affects the conjugate allylation of enals proceeding via polar pathways. We also demonstrate how this organocatalytic strategy could selectively install a valuable prenyl fragment at the &#946;&#8208;carbon of enals.

         <title>An on&#8208;surface Diels&#8211;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26346-26350, December 6, 2021. </description>

A hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was demonstrated on&#8208;surface in single molecules of a cyclic strained triyne. The starting material, several intermediates and the product were visualized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is one of the most popular reactions in organic chemistry. However, its use in the field of on&#8208;surface synthesis is hampered by the spatial restrictions of this cycloaddition reaction. Herein we selected a cyclic strained triyne to demonstrate an on&#8208;surface hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in a single molecule. The reaction was studied in detail by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO&#8208;functionalized tips. Our results pave the way to use this iconic pericyclic reaction for on&#8208;surface synthesis, introducing the concept of atom economy in the field.

         <title>Synergetic Cobalt&#8208;Copper&#8208;Based Bimetal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoboxes toward Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26397-26402, December 6, 2021. </description>

Cobalt&#8208;copper&#8208;based conductive bimetal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) have been synthesized as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst, through a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the bimetallic synergetic effect and the well&#8208;designed hollow architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and robust long&#8208;term stability toward efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts and understanding their underlying catalytic mechanism are of significant importance for the high&#8208;performance energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, we report novel CoCu&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well&#8208;designed architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high turnover frequency value of 0.326&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#8197;mV. In combination of quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed CoCu&#8208;based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O&#8722;O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.

         <title>ROS/RNS and Base Dual Activatable Merocyanine&#8208;Based NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Molecular Probe for in vivo Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26337-26341, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we developed a ROS/RNS and base dual activatable NIR&#8208;II molecular probe PN910 based on modulating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of a merocyanine fluorophore named Chrodol&#8208;3. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PN910 is a reliable NIR&#8208;II sensor for the non&#8208;invasive specific monitoring of H2O2 and ONOO&#8722; in alkaline tissue.







Abstract
Inflammation usually results in high&#8208;level reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) not only in acidic tissue but also in alkaline tissue. However, noninvasively in vivo monitoring reactive species specifically within alkaline tissue remains a huge challenge. Here we introduce a dual activatable fluorescent probe PN910 located in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 900&#8211;1700&#8197;nm), which shows high selectivity toward H2O2 and OONO&#8722; at pH beyond 7.4. Then we verified that PN910 could be used for the real&#8208;time, specific and accurate monitoring of cystitis and colitis for living animals. This report presents a unique approach to the development of dual activatable probe for in vivo biosensing.

         <title>Responsive Interfacial Assemblies Based on Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>

By taking advantage of charge transfer (CT) interactions between water&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;deficient acceptor and oil&#8208;soluble electron&#8208;rich donor, the formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. With CTCSs as the building block, higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties are produced, which can be used to stabilize and structure liquids.







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) interactions have been widely used to construct supramolecular systems, such as functional nanostructures and gels. However, to date, there is no report on the generation of CT complexes at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. Here, by using an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor dissolved in water and an electron&#8208;rich donor dissolved in oil, we present the in situ formation and assembly of CT complex surfactants (CTCSs) at the oil&#8211;water interface. With time, CTCSs can assemble into higher&#8208;order nanofilms with exceptional mechanical properties, allowing the stabilization of liquids and offering the possibility to structure liquids into nonequilibrium shapes. Moreover, due to the redox&#8208;responsiveness of the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, the association and dissociation of CTCSs can be reversibly manipulated in a redox process, leading to the switchable assembly and disassembly of the resultant constructs.

We report an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates, via strained cyclic alkyne intermediates generated in situ. The importance and utility of this method is exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.







Abstract
Difunctionalization of strained cyclic alkynes presents a powerful strategy to build richly functionalized cyclic alkenes in an expedient fashion. Herein we disclose an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates. We have demonstrated the novel use of zincate base/nucleophile system for effective formation of key cyclohexyne intermediates and selective addition of various carbon and nitrogen nucleophiles. Importantly, leveraging the resulting organozincates enables the incorporation of a broad range of electrophilic partners to deliver structurally diverse cyclohexene motifs. The importance and utility of this method is also exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Peptide Dendrimer Inspired from Glatiramer Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26403-26408, December 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To identify an alternative to the polymeric peptide drug Glatiramer Acetate (GA) used to treat multiple sclerosis, we tested peptide dendrimers with a size and composition similar to that of GA for their ability to induce the release of the cytokine IL1&#8208;Ra from primary human monocytes. The best dendrimer is as active as GA and is shown by fluorescence labelling to internalize into monocytes and to trigger a distinct anti&#8208;inflammatory response.







Abstract
Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random polypeptide drug used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. With the aim of identifying a precisely defined alternative to GA, we synthesized a library of peptide dendrimers with an amino acid composition similar to GA. We then challenged the dendrimers to trigger the release of the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;1 receptor antagonist (IL&#8208;1Ra) from human monocytes, which is one of the effects of GA on immune cells. Several of the largest dendrimers tested were as active as GA. Detailed profiling of the best hit showed that this dendrimer induces the differentiation of monocytes towards an M2 (anti&#8208;inflammatory) state as GA does, however with a distinct immune marker profile. Our peptide dendrimer might serve as starting point to develop a well&#8208;defined immunomodulatory analog of GA.

         <title>Directed Regioselective Carbometallation of 1,2&#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26368-26372, December 6, 2021. </description>

The copper&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation reaction of cyclopropenes is a well&#8208;established method for the synthesis of stereodefined cyclopropanes. All existing reports to date proceeded towards the formation of the electronically more stable organometallic intermediate. Herein we report a regioselective addition to 1,2&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropene possessing a tethered directing group to direct the organometallic species towards the formation of single regioisomer intermediate out of two electronically unbiased possibilities.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation of 1,2&#8208;dialkylated cyclopropenes is reported. The regioselectivity is controlled by a subtle tethered Lewis basic moiety. The chelating moieties allow the differentiation between two electronically tantamount organometallic intermediates. Further functionalization grants access to polysubstituted stereodefined cyclopropanes bearing up to five alkyl groups.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Fusion Cellular Vesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 50, Page 26320-26326, December 6, 2021. </description>

Genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) were developed to elicit potent antitumor immunity by concurrently blocking innate immune checkpoint CD47 and adaptive immune checkpoint PD&#8208;L1. The Fus&#8208;CVs represent a simple, safe and robust alternative to fusion proteins for multi&#8208;targeting immune blockade checkpoint (ICB) therapy.







Abstract
Herein, we report that genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) displaying high&#8208;affinity SIRP&#945; variants and PD&#8208;1 can activate potent antitumor immunity through both innate and adaptive immune effectors. Dual&#8208;blockade of CD47 and PD&#8208;L1 with Fus&#8208;CVs significantly increases the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, promotes antigen presentation, and activates antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the bispecific targeting design of Fus&#8208;CVs ensures better targeting on tumor cells, but less on other cells, which reduces systemic side effects and enhances therapeutic efficacies. In malignant melanoma and mammary carcinoma models, we demonstrate that Fus&#8208;CVs significantly improve overall survival of model animals by inhibiting post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Fus&#8208;CVs are suitable for protein display by genetic engineering. These advantages, integrated with other unique properties inherited from source cells, make Fus&#8208;CVs an attractive platform for multi&#8208;targeting immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

         <title>Molecular Transition Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts for the Reversible Carbon Dioxide&#8208;Carbon Monoxide Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) enzymes are active for the reversible CO oxidation &#8211; CO2&#160;reduction reaction and are of interest in the context of CO2&#160;abatement and carbon neutral solar fuels. Bioinspired by the active site composition of the CODH&#8217;s, polyoxometalates triply substituted with first row transition metals, were modularly synthesized. The polyanions, in short,&#160;&#160;{SiM3W9} and {SiM'2M"W9}, M,&#160;M',&#160;M"&#160;= CuII, NiII, FeIII&#160;are shown to be electrocatalysts for reversible CO oxidation &#8211; CO2&#160;reduction. A catalytic Tafel plot showed that&#160;{SiCu3W9}&#160;was the most reactive for CO2&#160;reduction, and electrolysis reactions yielded significant amounts of CO with 98% faradaic efficiency. In contrast, Fe&#8208;Ni compounds such as {SiFeNi2W9}&#160;preferably catalyzed the oxidation of CO to CO2&#160;similar to what is observed for the [NiFe]&#8208;CODH enzyme. Compositional control of the heterometal complexes, now and in the future leads to control of reactivity and selectivity for CO2&#160;electrocatalytic reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation Pathways in Colloidal CdTeSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rarely studied transformation in colloidal ternary magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) is addressed. We report the first observation of the transformation from ternary CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 to MSC&#8208;422, which occurs at room temperature. These two MSC types display sharp optical absorption resonances at 399 and 422 nm respectively, and are related in that they are quasi isomers, together with their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs). Binary CdTe and CdSe samples were prepared in the prenucleation stage also called the induction period (IP). After they were mixed and placed in a mixture of toluene and octylamine, the transformation was found to take place and to be assisted by the addition of the CdSe IP sample. A binary IP sample contains corresponding binary PCs and monomers (Mo) and fragments (Fr). We argue that the transformation pathway is enabled by the corresponding ternary PCs, involving the substitution reaction, namely CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;1 &#8658; CdTeSe PC&#8208;422 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;2. The present study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation characteristics of the MSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An ideal cancer treatment should not only destroy primary tumors, but also improve the immunogenicity of tumor microenvironment to achieve satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor immune effect.&#160; Herein, we designed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored rhenium(I) photosensitizer, named as  CA&#8208;Re, not only performing type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT) with high efficiency under hypoxia (nanomolar&#8208;level phototoxicity), but also evoking gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptotic cell death to effectively stimulate tumor immunogenicity. Meanwhile,  CA&#8208;Re&#160;could disrupt and self&#8208;report the loss of membrane integrity simultaneously. As a result, this promoted the maturation and antigen&#8208;presenting ability of dendritic cells (DCs), and fully activated T cells dependent adaptive immune response in vivo, eventually eliminating distant tumors at the same time as destroying primary tumors. To the best of our knowledge,  CA&#8208;Re  is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a tantalizing angle for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Persistent Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Thioketyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal salts, M  +  [Ter(  i  Pr)P&#8208;C(=S)&#8208;P(  i  Pr)  2  S]  &#8226;&#8722;  (M = Na, K;  2_M;  Ter = 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;phenyl) containing a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(  i  Pr)P&#8208;C(=S)&#8208;P(  i  Pr)  2  S (  1  ), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single crystal X&#8208;ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within  2_M  is mainly located at the sulfur (49%) and the carbonyl carbon (33%) atoms. Upon adding [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand to the radical species  2_K  to minimize the interionic interaction, an activation reaction was observed, yielding a potassium salt with a phosphanyl thioether based anion, [K(crypt)]  +  [Ter(  i  Pr)P&#8208;C(&#8211;S&#8208;  i  Pr)&#8208;P(  i  Pr)  2  S]  &#8722;  (  3  ) as the product of an intermolecular shift of an  i  Pr group from a second anion. The products were fully characterized and application of the radical anion as a reducing agent was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanocene(III) Catalyzed Precision Deuteration of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a titanocene(III) catalyzed deuterosilylation of epoxides that provides &#946;&#8211;deuterated anti&#8208;Markovnikov alcohols with excellent D&#8208;incorporation, in high yield, and often excellent diastereoselectivity after desilylation. The key to the success of the reaction is a novel activation method of Cp2TiCl2 and (tBuC5H4)2TiCl2 with BnMgBr and PhSiD3 to provide [(RC5H4)2Ti(III)D] without isotope scrambling. It was developed after discovering an off&#8208;cycle scrambling with the previously described method. Our precision deuteration can be applied to the synthesis of drug precursors and highlights the power of combining radical chemistry with organometallic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of separation methods, e.g. liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions  kT  , required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few  kT  for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Structure, Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a new family of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; mesoporous silica nanoparticles has attracted great interest with widespread applications. Despite a large number of publications (&gt;800), the terminology of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; is ambiguous. Understanding what possible &#8220;dendritic structures&#8221; are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8208;property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree branch&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like structures can be distinguished, both described as &#8220;dendritic&#8221; in literature. In this review, we start with the definition of &#8220;dendritic&#8221;, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We also update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; nanoparticles, with a focus on how to control different structural parameters. Various applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus in biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure&#8208;property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metallic conductivity in polyacetylene [&#8208;HC=CH&#8208;]n upon doping represents a landmark achievement. However, the insolubility of polyacetylene and a dearth of methods for its chemical modification have limited its widespread use. Here, we employ a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) protocol to prepare functionalized polyacetylenes (fPAs) bearing: (1) electron&#8208;deficient boryl (&#8208;BR2) and phosphoryl (&#8208;P(O)R2) side chains; (2) electron&#8208;donating amino (&#8208;NR2) groups, and (3) ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium units via strain&#8208;promoted Click chemistry. These functional groups render most of the fPAs soluble and can lead to intense light absorption across the visible to near&#8208;IR region. Also, the presence of redox&#8208;active boryl and amino groups leads to opposing near&#8208;IR optical responses upon (electro)chemical reduction or oxidation. Some of the resulting fPAs show greatly enhanced air stability when compared to known polyacetylenes. Lastly, these fPAs can be cross&#8208;linked to yield network materials with the full retention of optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Bismuth Bicycles: In Situ Access to Stable Constrained Peptides with Superior Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We report here a fundamentally new strategy for the facile generation of bicyclic peptides using linear precursor peptides with three cysteine residues and non&#8208;toxic trivalent bismuth(III) salt. Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles form instantaneously at physiological pH, are stable in aqueous solution for many weeks, and much more resistant to proteolysis than their linear precursors. The strategy allows the  in&#8208;situ  generation of bicyclic ligands for biochemical screening assays. We demonstrate this for two screening campaigns targeting the proteases from Zika and West Nile viruses, revealing a new lead compound that displayed inhibition constants of 23 and 150 nM, respectively. Bicyclic peptides are up to 130 times more active and 19 times more proteolytically stable than their linear analogs without bismuth.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaphilones as Activation&#8208;Free Primary&#8208;Amine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation Reagents for Peptides, Proteins and Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Residue&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods for biomolecules are highly sought to expand the scope of their biological and medical applications. Inspired by the generation mechanism of natural vinylogous  &#947;  &#8208;pyridones (vPDNs), we have developed a novel unique azaphilone&#8208;based, activation&#8208;free primary amine&#8208;selective bioconjugation method for biomolecules. Our strategy allows facile functionalization of primary amine groups in peptides and proteins, including the clinically used therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, by generating a highly stable vPDN linkage. Excellent chemoselectivity toward primary amines also enables the azaphilone derivatives to specifically modify the lipid components of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while bypassing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and mammalian cells. The new method shows significant advantages including chemoselectivity, efficiency, flexibility and biocompatibility, and therefore provides a valuable addition to the current toolbox for biomolecule conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling syneresis of hydrogels using organic salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels can spontaneously undergo syneresis through fibre&#8208;fibre interactions and expel significant amounts of water upon aging. In this process, the hydrophobicity of fibres which regulates the 3D&#8208;rearrangement of the self&#8208;assembled structures during syneresis is important. Here, we show that we can control over the hydrophobic microenvironment of gels by incorporating organic salts into the gel fibre involving co&#8208;assembly enabling control of the macroscopic gel volume phase transition.</dc:description>
