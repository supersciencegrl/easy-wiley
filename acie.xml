      <title>Ligand Regulated Regiodivergent Hydrosilylation of Isoprene under Iron Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>A regiodivergent and stereoselective hydrosilylation of basic industrial feedstock isoprene with unactivated silanes has been developed using earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst. The manipulation of regioselectivity relies on fine modification of the coordination geometry of iron center. While a bidentate pyridine imine ligand promotes the formation of allylic silanes via a 4,1&#8208;addition, the selectivity toward 3,4&#8208;adduct homoallylic silanes was achieved by switching to tridentate nitrogen ligand. Experimental studies and analysis have been performed to interpret the mechanism and the regioselective manipulation. This work contributes to the art of regioselective control in alkene hydrofunctionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>Natural Soft/Rigid Superlattice as Anodes for High Performance Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The volume expansion and poor conductivity are two major obstacles that hinder the pursuing for the lithium&#8208;ion batteries with long cycling life and high power density. Herein, we highlight a misfit compound PbNbS  3  with soft/rigid superlattice structure, which was unambiguously confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and electrochemical characterization, as a promising anode material for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries with simultaneously optimized capacity, stability and conductivity. In this model, the soft PbS sublayers primarily react with lithium, endow the capacity and prevent the decompositon of the superlattice structure, while the rigid NbS  2  sublayers support the skeleton and enhances the migration of electrons and lithium ions, as a result synergistically leading to a specific capacity of 710 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 100 mA g  &#8722;1  which is 1.6 times of NbS  2  and 3.9 times of PbS.

      <title>Exploitation of the New Reactivity of Vinylcyclopropanes for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed, Asymmetric [5+2] Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>
      <dc:description>Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) are commonly used in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions, and the exploitation of their recently realized reactivities to construct new cyclic architectures is of great significance in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, visible light&#8208;driven, asymmetric [5+2] cycloaddition of VCPs with &#945;&#8208;diazoketones was first accomplished by switching the reactivity of the Pd&#8208;containing dipolar intermediates from all&#8208;carbon 1,3&#8208;dipoles to oxo&#8208;1,5&#8208;dipoles. Enantioenriched 7&#8208;membered lactones were produced with good reaction efficiency and selectivity (23 examples, 52&#8208;92% yields with up to 99:1 er and 12.5:1 dr). In addition, computational investigations were performed to rationalize the observed high chemo&#8208; and periselectivities.</dc:description>

      <title>Outer Membrane Protease (OmpT)&#8208;based E. coli Sensing with Anionic Polythiophene and Unlabeled Peptide Substrate</title>
      <dc:description>E. coli  and  Salmonella  are two of the most common bacterial pathogens involved in food and water borne related deaths. Hence, it is critical to develop rapid and sensitive detection strategies for near outbreak applications. We report a simple and specific assay to detect as low as 1 CFU/mL of  E. coli  in water within 6 hours by targeting the bacteria&#8217;s surface protease activity. The assay relies on polythiophene acetic acid (PTAA) as optical reporter and a short unlabeled peptide (LL37  FRRV  ) previously optimized as substrate for OmpT, an outer membrane protease on  E. coli  . LL37  FRRV  interacts with PTAA to enhance its fluorescence while also inducing the formation of a helical PTAA&#8208;LL37  FRRV  construct, as confirmed by Circular Dichroism. However, in the presence of  E. coli  , LL37  FRRV  is cleaved and can no longer affect PTAA&#8217;s conformation and optical properties. This ability to distinguish between intact and cleaved peptide was investigated in detail using LL37  FRRV  sequence variants.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Sensitized Photon Upconversion Efficiency via Nanocrystal Wavefunction and Molecular Geometry</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet energy transfer from inorganic nanocrystals to molecular acceptors has attracted strong attention as a promising approach to high&#8208;efficiency photon upconversion that is important for energy&#8208;related applications. Because energy transfer is a donor&#8208;acceptor interfacial process, it is essential to simultaneously engineer the nanocrystal and molecular parameters in order to uncover unified physical principles that are transferable among different systems. Here we study this problem using CsPbBr  3  and CdSe nanocrystals as triplet donors and carboxylated anthracene isomers as acceptors. We find that the position of the carboxyl anchoring group on the molecule dictates the donor&#8208;acceptor coupling to be either &#8220;through&#8208;bond&#8221; or &#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;, while the relative strengths of the two coupling pathways is controlled by the &#8220;wavefunction&#8208;leakage&#8221; of nanocrystals that can be quantitatively tuned by nanocrystal sizes or shell thicknesses. By simultaneously engineering molecular geometry and nanocrystal wavefunction, energy transfer and photon upconversion efficiencies of a nanocrystal/molecule system can be improved by orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Control of Charge Transfer Excitons Toward High&#8208;Contrast Reversible Mechanoresponsive Luminescent Switching: Magic of a Volatile Third Party in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Realizing mechanochromism in rigid molecular systems is very important and highly desirable to broaden their potential applications. Here, a novel and practicable strategy to rationally obtain the reversible mechanochromic luminescent (MCL) material with high&#8208;contrast ratio (green versus red) has been established. Namely, by introducing a volatile third party (small&#8208;sized solvent molecules) into the lattice of charge transfer (CT) cocrystal of mixed&#8208;stacking 1:1 coronene (Cor.) and napthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NDI), a noteworthy reconfigurable molecular assembly is ingeniously achieved due to the loosely packing arrangement as well as weakened intermolecular interactions. Accordingly, the CT excited state, strongly corresponding to the molecular stacking modes, can be intentionally tailored through external stimulus (i.e. heating, grinding, or solvent), accompanying with distinct changes in photophysical properties. Subsequently, a high&#8208;contrast reversible MCL with highly sensitive and good reproducibility is realized and the underlying mechanism is thoroughly revealed.</dc:description>

      <title>Coordination of Actinide Single Ions with Deformed Graphdiyne: Strategy on Essential Separation Processes in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
      <dc:description>The coordination of actinides, lanthanides, as well as strontium and cesium with graphdiyne (GDY) was studied by experiments and theoretical calculations. On the basis of experimental results and/or theoretical calculations, it was suggested that Th  4+  , Pu  4+  , Am  3+  , Cm  3+  and Cs  +  exist in single ion states on the special triangle structure of GDY with various coordination patterns, in which GDY itself is deformed in different manners. Both experiments and theoretical calculations strongly support that UO  2  2+  , La  3+  , Eu  3+  , Tm  3+  and Sr  2+  are not adsorbed by GDY at all. The distinguished adsorption behaviors of GDY afford an important strategy for highly selective separation between actinides and lanthanides, Th  4+  and UO  2  2+  ,  Cs  +  and Sr  2+  in nuclear fuel cycle. Also, the present work sheds light on an approach to explore the unique functions and physicochemical properties of actinides in single ion states.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>DNA nanostructures have shown potentials in cancer therapy. However, current clinical practice is hampered by the difficulty to deliver them into cancer cells and susceptibility to nuclease degradation. To overcome these limitations, we report herein a periodically&#8208;ordered nick&#8208;hidden DNA nanowire (NW) with high serum stability and active targeting functionality. The inner core is made of multiple&#8208;connected DNA double helices and the outer shell is composed of regularly&#8208;arranged standing&#8208;up hairpin aptamers. All terminals of the components are hidden from nuclease attacks while the target&#8208;binding sites are exposed to allow delivery to the cancer target. The DNA NW remains intact over 24&#8208;h incubation in serum solution. Animal imaging and cell apoptosis show that the anticancer drugs formulated NW displays long blood&#8208;circulation time and high specificity in inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Treatment of tumor&#8208;bearing mice validates  in vivo  therapeutic efficacy, demonstrating an ideal theranostic vehicle for targeted imaging and therapy of cancers.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogenase mimics in M12L24 nano&#8208;spheres to control overpotential and activity in proton reduction catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogenase enzymes are excellent proton reduction catalysts and therefore provide clear blueprints for the development of nature inspired synthetic analogs. Mimicking their catalytic center is straightforward but mimicking the protein matrix around the active site and all its functions remains challenging. Synthetic models lack this precisely controlled second coordination sphere that provides substrate preorganization and catalyst stability and, as a result, their performances are far from those of the natural enzyme. In this contribution we report a strategy to easily introduce a specific yet customizable second coordination sphere around synthetic hydrogenase models by encapsulation inside M  12  L  24  cages and at the same time create a proton&#8208;rich nano&#8208;environment by co&#8208;encapsulation of ammonium salts, effectively providing substrate preorganization and intermediates stabilization. We show that catalyst encapsulation in these nano&#8208;cages reduces the catalytic overpotential for proton reduction by 250 mV as compared to the uncaged catalyst while the proton&#8208;rich nano&#8208;environment created around the catalyst ensures that high catalytic rates are maintained.</dc:description>

      <title>Identification of Histone&#8208;deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;associated Proteins with DNA&#8208;Programmed Affinity Labeling</title>
      <dc:description>Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a major class of deacetylation enzymes. Many HDACs exist in large protein complexes in cells and their functions strongly depend on the complex composition. The identification of HDAC&#8208;associated proteins is highly important in understanding their molecular mechanisms. Although affinity probes have been developed to study HDACs, they were mostly targeting the direct binder HDAC, while other proteins in the complex remain under&#8208;explored. We report a DNA&#8208;based affinity labeling method capable of presenting different probe configurations  without  the need for preparing multiple probes. Using one binding probe, 9 probe configurations were created to profile HDAC complexes. Notably, this method identified indirect HDAC binders that may be inaccessible to traditional affinity probes, and it also revealed new biological implications for HDAC&#8208;associated proteins. This study provided a simple and broadly applicable method for characterizing protein&#8208;protein interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;molecule analysis determines isozymes of human alkaline phosphatase in serum</title>
      <dc:description>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an important biomarker, as high levels of ALP in blood can indicate liver disease or bone disorders. However, current clinical blood tests only measure the total concentration of ALP but are unable to distinguish enzyme isotypes. Here, we demonstrate a novel and rapid approach to profile various ALP isozymes in blood via a single&#8208;molecule&#8208;analysis platform. The microarray platform provides enzyme kinetics of hundreds of individual molecules at high throughput. Using these single molecule kinetics, we characterize the different activity profiles of ALP isotypes. By analyzing both healthy and disease samples, we found the single molecule activity distribution of ALP in serum reflects the health status of patients. This result demonstrates the potential utility of the method for improving the conventional ALP test, as well as for analyzing other enzymatic biomarkers, including enzyme isotypes.</dc:description>

      <title>Making and breaking leupeptin protease inhibitors in pathogenic gammaproteobacteria</title>
      <dc:description>Leupeptin is a bacterial small molecule that is used worldwide as a protease inhibitor. However, its biosynthesis and genetic distribution remain unknown. Here, we identified a family of leupeptins in gammaproteobacterial pathogens, including Photorhabdus,&#160;Xenorhabdus, and Klebsiella species, amongst others. Through genetic, metabolomic, and heterologous expression analyses, we established their construction from discretely expressed ligases and accessory enzymes. In Photorhabdus species, a hypothetical protein required for colonizing nematode hosts was established as a new class of proteases. This enzyme cleaved the tripeptide aldehyde protease inhibitors, leading to the formation of &#8220;pro&#8208;pyrazinones&#8221; featuring a hetero&#8208;tricyclic architecture. In Klebsiella oxytoca, the pathway was enriched in clinical isolates associated with respiratory tract infections. Thus, the bacterial production and proteolytic degradation of leupeptins can be associated with animal colonization phenotypes.</dc:description>

      <title>PST&#8208;24: A Zeolite with Varying Intracrystalline Channel Dimensionality</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;24, a novel channel&#8208;based medium&#8208;pore zeolite. This zeolite was synthesized using pentamethylimidazolium ions as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent via the excess fluoride approach. A combination of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electron diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that its structure is built by composite  cas&#8208;zigzag  (  cas&#8208;zz  ) building chains, which are connected by double 5&#8208;ring (  d5r  ) columns. While the  cas&#8208;zz  building chains are ordered in the PST&#8208;24 framework, the  d5r  columns adopt one of two possible arrangements; the two adjacent  d5r  columns are either at the same height or at different heights, denoted arrangements S and D, which can be regarded as open and closed &#8220;valves&#8221; that connect the channels, respectively. A framework with arrangement D only has a 2D 10&#8208;ring channel system, whereas that with arrangement S only contains 3D channels. In actual PST&#8208;24 crystals, the open and closed valves are almost randomly dispersed to yield a zeolite framework where the channel dimensionality varies locally from 2D to 3D. Such a unique pore structure renders PST&#8208;24 highly selective for 1,3&#8208;butanediol dehydration.</dc:description>

      <title>Rabies Virus&#8208;Inspired Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Targeted Imaging and Chemotherapy of Glioma</title>
      <dc:description>The blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) restricts access to the brain of more than 98% of therapeutic agents and is largely responsible for treatment failure of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a safe and efficient strategy for more effective drug delivery across the BBB into the brain. Inspired by the extraordinary capability of rabies virus (RABV) to enter the central nervous system, we report the development and evaluation of the metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based nanocarrier MILB@LR, which closely mimicked both the bullet&#8208;shape structure and surface functions of natural RABV. MILB@LR benefited from a more comprehensive RABV&#8208;mimic strategy than mimicking individual features of RABV and exhibited significantly enhanced BBB penetration and brain tumor targeting. MILB@LR also displayed superior inhibition of tumor growth when loaded with oxaliplatin. The results demonstrated that MILB@LR may be valuable for GBM targeting and treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>A Planar, Conjugated N4&#8208;macrocyclic Cobalt Complex for Heterogeneous Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Metal complexes have been widely investigated as promising electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction. Most of the current research efforts mainly focus on ligands based on pyrrole subunits and the reported activities are still far from satisfactory. A novel planar and conjugated N4&#8208;macrocyclic cobalt complex (Co(II)CPY) derived from phenanthroline subunits is prepared herein, which delivers high activity for heterogeneous CO  2  electrocatalysis to CO in an aqueous medium and outperforms most of the metal complexes reported so far. At a molar loading of 5.93&#215;10  &#8208;8  mol cm  &#8208;2  , it exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 96% and a turnover frequency of 9.59 s  &#8208;1  towards CO at &#8208;0.70 V  vs  . RHE. The unraveling of electronic structural features suggests a synergistic effect from ligand to cobalt in Co(II)CPY plays a critical role in boosting its activity.

      <title>EGF&#8208;like and Other Disulfide&#8208;rich Microdomains as Therapeutic Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>
Disulfide&#8208;rich microdomains are underexplored scaffolds for therapeutic drug design. In this Review, the most abundant domains present in the animal and plant kingdoms are highlighted, and their structures and functional activities are analysed to provide an insight into their use in design of next&#8208;generation peptide therapeutics.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds typically introduce conformational constraints into peptides and proteins, conferring improved biopharmaceutical properties and greater therapeutic potential. In our opinion, disulfide&#8208;rich microdomains from proteins are potentially a rich and under&#8208;explored source of drug leads. A survey of the UniProt protein database shows that these domains are widely distributed throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, with the EGF&#8208;like domain being the most abundant of these domains. EGF&#8208;like domains exhibit large diversity in their disulfide bond topologies and calcium binding modes, which we classify in detail here. We found that many EGF&#8208;like domains are associated with disease phenotypes, and the interactions they mediate are potential therapeutic targets. Indeed, EGF&#8208;based therapeutic leads have been identified, and we further propose that these domains can be optimized to expand their therapeutic potential using chemical design strategies. This Review highlights the potential of disulfide&#8208;rich microdomains as future peptide therapeutics.

      <title>Polymer Transformers: Interdigitating Reaction Networks of Fueled Monomer Species to Reconfigure Functional Polymer States</title>
      <dc:description>Adaptivity is an essential trait of life. Its mimicry using chemical systems remains a grand challenge. One type of adaptivity is the reconfiguration of functional system states by correlating sensory inputs. We report &#8220;polymer transformers&#8221; that can adaptively reconfigure their composition from a state of a mixed copolymer to being enriched in either monomer A or B. This is achieved by embedding and hierarchically interconnecting two chemically fueled activation/deactivation enzymatic reaction networks for both monomers via a joint activation pathway (network level) and an AB linker monomer reactive to both A and B (species level). We show that the ratio of enzymes governing the individual deactivation pathways, i.e. our external signals, control the enrichment behavior in the dynamic state. The method shows high programmability of the reconfigured state, rejuvenation of transformation cycles, and quick  in situ  adaptation. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, we showcase this dynamic reconfiguration for colloidal surface functionalities.</dc:description>

      <title>Fast and long&#8208;lasting Fe(&#8546;) reduction by boron toward green and accelerated Fenton chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Generation of hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton system (Fe(II)/H  2  O  2  ) is seriously limited by the sluggish kinetics of Fe(III) reduction and fast Fe(III) precipitation. For the first time, we discover that boron crystals (C&#8208;Boron) remarkably accelerate the Fe(III)/Fe(II) circulation in Fenton&#8208;like systems (C&#8208;Boron/Fe(III)/H  2  O  2  ) to produce a myriad of hydroxyl radicals with excellent efficiencies in oxidative degradation of various pollutants. The surface B&#8208;B bonds and interfacial suboxide boron in the surface B  12  icosahedra are the active sites to donate electrons to promote fast Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and further enhance hydroxyl radical production via the Fenton chemistry. The C&#8208;Boron/Fe(III)/H  2  O  2  system outperforms the benchmark Fenton (Fe(II)/H  2  O  2  ) and Fe(III)&#8208;based sulfate radical systems. The reactivity and stability of crystalline boron is much higher than the popular molecular reducing agents, nanocarbons, and other metal/metal&#8208;free nanomaterials. Therefore, the discovery opens up a new avenue to leveraging metal&#8208;free boron for green oxidation and fast environmental decontamination.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface oxide&#8208;rich activation layer (SOAL) on Ni2Mo3N for rapid and durable oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to renewable energy technologies such as water electrolysis and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the multiple steps associated with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer result in sluggish OER kinetics and catalysts are required. Here we demonstrate that a novel nitride, Ni2Mo3N, is a highly active OER catalyst that outperforms the benchmark material RuO2  . Ni2Mo3N exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  at a nominal overpotential of 270 mV in 0.1 M KOH with outstanding catalytic cyclability and durability. Structural characterization and computational studies reveal that the excellent activity stems from formation of a surface oxide&#8208;rich activation layer (SOAL). Secondary Mo atoms on the surface act as electron pumps that stabilize oxygen&#8208;containing species and facilitate continuity of the reactions. This discovery will stimulate further development of ternary nitrides with oxide surface layers as efficient OER catalysts for electrochemical energy devices.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to renewable energy technologies such as water electrolysis and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the multiple steps associated with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer result in sluggish OER kinetics and catalysts are required. Here we demonstrate that a novel nitride, Ni2Mo3N, is a highly active OER catalyst that outperforms the benchmark material RuO2  . Ni2Mo3N exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  at a nominal overpotential of 270 mV in 0.1 M KOH with outstanding catalytic cyclability and durability. Structural characterization and computational studies reveal that the excellent activity stems from formation of a surface oxide&#8208;rich activation layer (SOAL). Secondary Mo atoms on the surface act as electron pumps that stabilize oxygen&#8208;containing species and facilitate continuity of the reactions. This discovery will stimulate further development of ternary nitrides with oxide surface layers as efficient OER catalysts for electrochemical energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Can an elusive Pt(III) oxidation state be exposed in an isolated complex?</title>
      <dc:description>Platinum(IV) complexes are extensively studied for their activity against cancer cells as potential substitutes for the widely used platinum(II) drugs.

      <title>Pseudo&#8208;membrane jackets: Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers achieving visible phase separation in cell membrane</title>
      <dc:description>Cell membranes contain lateral systems that consist of various lipid compositions and actin cytoskeleton, providing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) platforms for chemical reactions. However, such complex 2D environments have not yet been used as a synthetic platform for artificial 2D nanomaterials. Herein, we demonstrate the direct synthesis of 2D coordination polymers (CPs) at the liquid&#8722;cell interface of the plasma membrane of living cells. The coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of networking metal complex lipids produces cyanide&#8208;bridged CP layers with metal ions, enabling &#8216;pseudo&#8208;membrane jackets&#8217; that produce long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;domains with a size of 1&#8211;5 &#956;m. The resultant artificial and visible phase separation systems remain stable even in the absence of actin skeletons in cells. Moreover, the jackets achieved the enhancement of cellular calcium response to ATP. This confirms that the artificial nanomaterials formed via moderate coordinative intermolecular interactions create a 2D scaffold on complex cell membrane environments, thereby providing a unique tool for the chemical control of cell functions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Aqueous&#8208;phase isomerization of D&#8208;glucose to D&#8208;fructose and L&#8208;sorbose are catalyzed in parallel by Lewis acidic Ti sites in siliceous frameworks.

Isomerization rates decrease to lower values (by ~20&#215;) with further decreases in micropore size as Ti sites are confined within 10&#8208;MR pores (Ti&#8208;MFI, Ti&#8208;CON), likely because of intrapore reactant diffusion restrictions, and reach undetectable values within the 8&#8208;MR pores of Ti&#8208;CHA as size exclusion prevents glucose from accessing active sites. Remarkably, the selectivity toward L&#8208;sorbose over D&#8208;fructose increases systematically as spatial constraints around Ti sites become tighter, and is &gt;10 on Ti&#8208;MFI. These findings demonstrate the marked influence of confinement around Ti active sites on the selectivity between parallel stereoselective sugar isomerization pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing Interfacial Evolution of Lithium Dendrite and Its&#160;Solid Electrolyte Interphase Shell in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Unstable electrode/solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface and internal Li dendrite penetration hamper the widespread application of the solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLMBs), which requires operando techniques to accurately disclose the underlying mechanisms. Herein, in situ optical microscopy insights into the Li plating/stripping processes in a gel polymer electrolyte reveal the corresponding dynamic evolution. Uniform Li deposits evolve into moss&#8208;like and branch&#8208;shaped Li dendrites with the increasing current density. Remarkably, the on&#8208;site&#8208;formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) shell on the Li dendrite is distinctly captured after Li stripping. Quantitative analyses additionally explore the elevated physical and chemical properties, and the favourable local ionic conductivity of SEI shell. Inducing on&#8208;site&#8208;formed SEI shell with enhanced modulus to wrap the Li precipitation densely and uniformly, can effectually regulate the dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. An in&#8208;depth comprehension of the Li dendrite evolution and its functional SEI shell will further yield more significant information for fundamental studies and prospective optimization of SSLMBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Lasso Proteins: Modular Design, Cellular Synthesis and Topological Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Entangled proteins have attracted significant research interest.

As a versatile topological intermediate, lasso proteins could be converted to rotaxanes, heterocatenanes, and &#8220;slide&#8208;ring&#8221; networks.

In a reverse process, holes in the valence band of the illuminated TiO  2  cathode are driven for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by an applied voltage. A record&#8208;high discharge voltage of 1.90 V and an unprecedented low charge voltage of 0.59 V are achieved in the photo&#8208;involved Zn&#8208;air battery, regardless of the equilibrium voltage.

      <title>Spatial and Kinetic Regulation of Sulfur Electrochemistry on Semi&#8208;Immobilized Redox Mediators in Working Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The adoption of redox mediators (RMs) is regarded as an effective strategy to enhance reaction kinetics of multi&#8208;electron sulfur electrochemistry. However, the soluble small&#8208;molecule RMs usually aggravate the internal shuttle and thus further reduce the battery efficiency and cyclability. In this contribution, a semi&#8208;immobilization strategy is proposed for RM design to effectively regulate the sulfur electrochemistry while circumvent the inherent shuttle issue in a working battery. Small imide molecules as the model RMs were co&#8208;polymerized with moderate&#8208;chained polyether, rendering a semi&#8208;immobilized RM (PIPE) that is spatially restrained yet kinetically active. A small amount of PIPE (5% in cathode) extended the cyclability of sulfur cathode from 37 to 190 cycles with 80% capacity retention at 0.5 C. The semi&#8208;immobilization strategy not only fills up the understanding of RM&#8208;assisted sulfur electrochemistry in alkali metal batteries, but also enlightens the chemical design of active additives for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrafast Encapsulation of Metal Nanoclusters into MFI Zeolite in the Course of Its Crystallization: Catalytic Application for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect that combines superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials. The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites. We herein demonstrate a novel strategy toward overcoming the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. Such concept was proven by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM&#8208;5 (MFI) zeolite in the course of its crystallization, leading to an ultrafast,  in situ  encapsulation within just 5 min. The Pt/Sn&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, which further verified the successful encapsulation of metal clusters in zeolite.

Their unique architecture and large surface area enable these amorphous FePO  4  yolk&#8722;shell nanospheres to manifest remarkable sodium storage properties with high reversible capacity, outstanding rate performance, and ultralong cycle life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrocatalysis as the nexus for sustainable renewable energy. The Gordian knot of activity, stability, and selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Coupling harnessing of renewable energies with electro&#173;chemical technologies that convert the omnipresent molecules H  2  O, CO  2  and N  2  into chemical energy carriers and chemical feedstocks is at the frontier towards securing a sustainable green energy future. In this minireview, some weaknesses and incoherencies in the current predominant practices of determining electrocatalytic performance that have not only protracted progress towards realizing functional systems but also obstructed atomic and molecular scale insight into important fundamental properties and phenomena to inform rational bottom&#8208;up catalyst design are discussed. We highlight examples of stark discrepancies in material properties and electrocatalytic activity and stability that manifest when materials are tested at conditions of their envisaged deployment as opposed to common laboratory condi&#173;tions and thereby advocate for unified activity&#8208;stability correlations at application relevant conditions and disambiguation of reporting elec&#173;trocatalytic performance by contextualization with respect to funda&#173;mental inquisition or progress towards application.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The  RHO  gene encodes the GPCR rhodopsin. Numerous mutations associated with impaired visual cycle have been reported; the G90D mutation leads to a constitutively active mutant form of rhodopsin that causes CSNB disease. We report here on the structure investigation of the retinal configuration and conformation in the binding pocket in the dark and light&#8208;activated state by solution and MAS&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. We find two long&#8208;lived dark states for the G90D mutant with the 11&#8208;cis retinal bound as Schiff base in both populations. Thesecond minor population in the dark state is attributed to a slight shift in conformation of the covalently bound 11&#8208;cis retinal caused by the mutation&#8208;induced distortion on the salt bridge formation in the binding pocket. Time&#8208;resolved UV/VIS spectroscopy monitors the functional dynamics of the G90D mutant rhodopsin for all relevant time scales of the photocycle.

      <title>Cryogenic OrbiSIMS Localizes Semi&#8208;Volatile Molecules in Biological Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>OrbiSIMS is a recently developed instrument for label&#8208;free imaging of chemicals with micron spatial resolution and high mass resolution. We report a cryogenic workflow for OrbiSIMS (Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS) that improves chemical detection of lipids and other biomolecules in tissues. Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS boosts ionization yield and decreases ion&#8208;beam induced fragmentation, greatly improving the detection of biomolecules such as triacylglycerides. It also increases chemical coverage to include molecules with intermediate or high vapor pressures, such as free fatty acids and semi&#8208;volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). We find that Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS reveals the hitherto unknown localization patterns of SVOCs with high spatial and chemical resolution in diverse plant, animal and human tissues. We also show that Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS can be combined with genetic analysis to identify enzymes regulating SVOC metabolism. Cryo&#8208;OrbiSIMS is applicable to high resolution imaging of a wide variety of non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile molecules across many areas of biomedicine.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The visualization of temporal and spatial changes in the intracellular environment has great significance for chemistry and bioscience research. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is playing an increasingly important role in this field because of its unique advantages, such as being label&#8208;free and high throughput, yet it remains a great challenge for laser&#8208;based techniques due to limited lateral resolution. Here, we develop a simple, reliable and economic nanoscale MSI approach by introducing desorption laser with a micro&#8208;lensed fiber. Using this integrated platform, we achieved 300 nm resolution MSI and successfully visualized the distribution of various small&#8208;molecule drugs in subcellular locations. Moreover, exhaustive dynamic processes of anticancer drugs, including releasing from nanoparticle carriers entering nucleus of cells, can be readily acquired on an organelle scale. Considering the simplicity and universality of this nanoscale desorption device, it could be easily adapted to most of laser&#8208;based mass spectrometry applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of&#160;&#946;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives Enabled by Ligand&#8208;Controlled Reversal of Hydrocupration Regiochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>A Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds for the synthesis of&#160; &#946;  &#8208;amino acid derivatives was achieved through ligand&#8208;controlled reversal of the hydrocupration regioselectivity. While the hydrocupration of&#160;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds to form &#945;&#8208;cuprated species has been extensively investigated, we report&#160;  herein  &#160;that, in the presence of an appropriate ancillary chiral ligand, the alternative regiochemistry can be observed for cinnamic acid derivatives, leading to delivery of the copper to the&#160;  &#946;&#8208;position.&#160;This copper can react with an electrophilic aminating reagent, 1,2&#8208;benzisoxazole, to provide enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives, which are important building blocks for the synthesis of natural products and bioactive small molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Ordered Solid&#8208;State Microstructures of Conjugated Polymers Arisen from Solution&#8208;State Aggregation</title>
      <dc:description>Solution&#8208;state aggregation of conjugated polymers is critical in determining their solid&#8208;state microstructures and optoelectronic performance. However, controlling the solution&#8208;state aggregation of conjugated polymers for producing specific microstructures remains challenging. Herein, a practical approach is developed to finely tune the solid&#8208;state microstructures through temperature&#8208;controlled solution&#8208;state aggregation and polymer crystallization. High temperature generates significant conformation fluctuation of conjugated backbones in solution, which facilitates the polymer crystallization from solvated aggregates to orderly&#8208;packed structures. The polymer films deposited at high temperatures exhibit less structural disorders and higher electron mobilities (up to two orders of magnitude) in field&#8208;effect transistors, compared to those deposited at low temperatures. This work provides an effective strategy to tune the solution&#8208;state aggregation to reveal the relationship between solution&#8208;state aggregation and solid&#8208;state microstructures of conjugated polymers, which could accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance polymer optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Methanol assisted autocatalysis in catalytic methanol synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic methanol synthesis is one of the major processes in the chemical industry and may grow in importance, as methanol produced from CO2 and sustainably derived H2 is envisioned to play an important role as energy carrier in a future low CO2 emission society. However, despite the widespread use, the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites are not fully understood. Here we report that methanol synthesis at commercially applied conditions using the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is dominated by a methanol&#8208;assisted, autocatalytic reaction mechanism. We propose that the presence of methanol opens for hydrogenation of surface formate via methyl formate. Autocatalytic acceleration of the reaction is also observed for Cu supported on SiO2 although with low absolute activity, but not for Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. The results illustrate an important example of autocatalysis in heterogeneous catalysis and pave the way for further understanding, improvements and process optimization of industrial methanol synthesis.</dc:description>
