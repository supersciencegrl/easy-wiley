      <dc:description>Glassy polymer can hardly self&#8208;heal at room temperature because of their frozen polymer chains under such a state. Now, we designed and synthesized a colorless and transparent glassy polyurethane assembled using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight oligomers carrying a large number of loosely packed weak hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), which has a glass transition temperature (T  g  ) up to 36.8 &#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young&#8217;s modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03 GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network that the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76 MPa after healing for as little as 10 min, which is quite prominent compared to the reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. We revealed that the high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below T  g  of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, in spite of the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature. Based on these features, we demonstrate that our GPU shows potential application as an optical lens</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electrofluorescence from a Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecule</title>
      <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;OLEDs) are potential light&#8208;sources for various sensing applications since the OLEDs possess unique features such as ultra&#8208;flexibility and the possibility for low&#8208;cost fabrication. However, the rather low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR&#8208;OLEDs has been a critical obstacle for the potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR&#8208;OLEDs. The designed NIR&#8208;TADF emitter, TPA&#8208;PZTCN, has a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 40% with a peak wavelength at 729 nm even in a highly doped co&#8208;deposited film. The EL peak wavelength of the NIR&#8208;OLED is 734 nm with an EQE of 13.4%, which is unprecedented among rare&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR&#8208;OLEDs in this spectral range. Further, TPA&#8208;PZTCN can sensitize a deep NIR fluorophore to achieve a peak wavelength of approximately 900 nm, resulting in an EQE of over 1% in a TADF&#8208;sensitized NIR&#8208;OLED with high operational device durability (LT  95  &gt;600 hr.).</dc:description>

      <title>Boron&#8208;catalyzed Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides: on the Way to Pure C5 Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>The first C5 polymerization is reported, where the main&#8208;chain is growing by five carbon atoms of the monomer at a time. Three dienyltriphenylarsonium ylide monomers were synthesized and polymerized with triethylborane as initiator leading to random terpolymers (C1, C3, C5) with mainly C5 repeating units (up to 84.1%). It has been found that the methyl group (electron&#8208;donating substituent) on the conjugated double bond of ylides facilitates the formation of C5 segments. A mechanism was proposed based on NMR characterization and DFT calculations. The high C5 content ensures that we are on the right track for pure C5 homopolymerization.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Fabrication of Low&#8208;Coordinate Single&#8208;Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination environment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on pre&#8208;designed N&#8208;doped carbon derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6%, much superior to that of Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C shows excellent performance in Zn&#8208;CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to accurate control over coordination environment of SACs for CO2 utilization.</dc:description>

      <title>Biodegradable Charge Transfer Complexes for Glutathione Depletion Induced Ferroptosis and NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Suffering from the laborious synthesis and undesirable tumor microenvironment response, the exploitation of novel NIR&#8208;II absorbed organic photothermal agents is of importance to promote phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, two kinds of charge transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ and TMB&#8208;TCNQ) are prepared via supramolecular assembly. Because of the larger energy gap between donor and acceptor, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ presents higher charge transfer degree (72%) than that of TMB&#8208;TCNQ (48%) in nanoaggregates. Therefore, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ exhibits stronger NIR&#8208;II absorption ability with a mass extinction coefficient of 15.4 Lg  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 1300 nm and better photothermal effect. Impressively, the specific cysteine response can make the TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ effectively inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH, leading to redox dsyhomeostasis and ROS&#8208;mediated ferroptosis. TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ can serve as contrast agent for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic imaging to guide precise and efficient photothermal therapy  in vivo  .</dc:description>

      <title>Generation of elemental fluorine through the electrolysis of copper difluoride at room temperature</title>
      <dc:description>The safe generation of F2  gas at room temperature using simple cell configurations has been the &#8216;holy grail&#8217; of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report F2  gas generation through the electrolysis of CuF2  in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2  gas. The CuF2  is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass&#8208;like carbon demonstrate absence of the anode effect during F2  gas generation due to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium&#8208;temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100 h, achieving the F2  gas purity over 99 % with potential operation using one&#8208;compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious mechanism for high&#8208;purity fluorine gas generation for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.</dc:description>

During the heating and slow cooling process (0.5 K min  &#8211;1  ), its electronic and magnetic properties were altered clearly and repeatedly changed between diamagnetic solid and paramagnetic liquid states. The liquid state was transparent to near&#8208;IR light (940 nm), but the solid state was opaque, despite both samples exhibiting a similar green color under room light. Additionally, the liquid state was changed to a glass state under a fast cooling process (2&#8211;10 K min  &#8211;1  ).

      <title>Conformational plasticity of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides defines cell permeabilization activity.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8211;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin 9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin 9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin 9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical splitting of methane in molten salts to produce hydrogen</title>
      <dc:description>Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation due to coke deposition over catalysts, and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500 &#176;C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission&#8208;free and water&#8208;free manner. Following the most energy&#8208;saving route on methane&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation due to coke deposition over catalysts, and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500 &#176;C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission&#8208;free and water&#8208;free manner. Following the most energy&#8208;saving route on methane&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The generated anodic carbon dioxide is in situ captured by the melts and reduced to solid carbon at cathode, enabling a spatial separation of anodic hydrogen generation from cathodic carbon deposition. Life cycle assessment on hydrogen&#8208;generation technologies shows that the ESM experiences an equivalent carbon emission much lower than MSR, and a lower equivalent energy input than alkaline water electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A macromolecular drug for cancer therapy via extracellular calcification</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule&#8208;initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice.

      <title>Characterization and Mechanistic Study of the Radical SAM Enzyme ArsS Involved in Arsenosugar Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic&#8208;containing      ribosides  that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has long been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5'&#8208;dimethylarsinoyl&#8208;adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains largely elusive. In this study, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAs  III  ) to produce DDMAA. We show this radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Subsequent phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies, and these enzymes likely have originated from cyanobacteria. This study not only reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis but also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the remarkable catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.</dc:description>

The synthesis of segmented polyurethanes (SPUs) that contain difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) moieties in the main chain and methacryloyl groups in the side chains was carried out.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate damage detection ability and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.</dc:description>

      <title>Capturing Manganese Oxide Intermediates in Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Neutral pH by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct capture of an intermediate species on the surface of manganese oxide nanoparticles was achieved in electrochemical water oxidation and visualized using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A Raman band position at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 combined with isotope&#8208;labeling experiments using H218O and D2O confirmed the generation of the surface terminal MnIV=O species, which is the water oxidation intermediate for the oxygen evolution reaction. Key: rate&#8208;determining step (RDS).







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising means to produce eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen fuels. Inspired by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in nature, substantial works have been performed to develop efficient manganese (Mn)&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts. Despite improvements in catalytic activity, the underlying mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not completely elucidated owing to the lack of direct spectroscopic evidence for the active Mn&#8208;oxo moieties. We identify water oxidation intermediates on the surface of Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in the OER at neutral pH by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A potential&#8208;dependent Raman peak was detected at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and assigned to the active MnIV=O species generated during water oxidation. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments combined with scavenger experiments confirmed the generation of surface terminal MnIV=O intermediates in the Mn&#8208;oxide NPs. This study provides an insight into the design of systems for the observation of reaction intermediates.

      <dc:description>Here we show that by adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl ammonium and phosphonium salts in water (  1.5&#8208;2.0 m), hydrophobic solvation triggers the formation of a unique, highly incompressible supramolecular liquid, with a dynamic structure similar to clathrates, involving essentially all H  2  O molecules of the solvent. Despite the increasing local order, the thermal diffusivity and compressibility of these supramolecular liquids is strongly reduced with respect to bulk water, due to slower relaxation dynamics.

      <title>Folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches for monitoring DNA repair enzymes activity</title>
      <dc:description>We demonstrate here a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanoswitches that, upon enzymatic repair, could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. Such folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are synthetic DNA sequences containing O6&#8208;methyl&#8208;guanine (O6&#8208;MeG) nucleobases and labelled with a fluorophore/quencher optical pair. The nanoswitches are rationally designed so that only upon enzymatic demethylation of the O6&#8208;MeG nucleobases they can form stable intramolecular Hoogsteen interactions and fold into an optically active triplex DNA structure. We have first characterized the folding mechanism induced by the enzymatic repair activity through fluorescent experiments and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We then demonstrated that the folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are suitable and specific substrates for different methyltransferase enzymes including the human homologue (hMGMT) and they allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchy Control of MFI Zeolite Membrane towards Superior Butane Isomer Separation Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Microstructural optimization (e.g., thickness and preferred orientation) represents a major concern for performance enhancement of zeolite membranes.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microstructural optimization (e.g., thickness and preferred orientation) represents a major concern for performance enhancement of zeolite membranes.

      <title>Fungal Dioxygenase AsqJ Is Promiscuous and Bimodal: Substrate&#8208;Directed Formation of Quinolones versus&#160;Quinazolinones</title>
      <dc:description>Previous studies showed that the Fe  II  /&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase AsqJ induces a skeletal rearrangement in viridicatin biosynthesis in  Aspergillus nidulans  , generating a quinolone scaffold from benzo[1.4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates. We report that AsqJ catalyzes an additional, entirely different reaction, simply by a change in substituent in the benzodiazepinedione substrate. This new mechanism is established by substrate screening, application of functional probes, and computational analysis. AsqJ excises H  2  CO from the heterocyclic ring structure of suitable benzo[1.4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates to generate quinazolinones. This novel AsqJ catalysis pathway is governed by a single substituent within the complex substrate. This unique substrate&#8208;directed reactivity of AsqJ enables the targeted biocatalytic generation of either quinolones or quinazolinones, two alkaloid frameworks of exceptional biomedical relevance.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Addition of &#945;&#8208;Nitroesters to Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
An enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to alkynes affords access to &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors containing contiguous stereocenters. These motifs can be further transformed into &#945;&#8208;amino esters without stereoablation.







Abstract
By using Rh&#8211;H catalysis, we couple &#945;&#8208;nitroesters and alkynes to prepare &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors. This atom&#8208;economical strategy generates two contiguous stereocenters, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. In this transformation, the alkyne undergoes isomerization to generate a RhIII&#8211;&#960;&#8208;allyl electrophile, which is trapped by an &#945;&#8208;nitroester nucleophile. A subsequent reduction with In powder transforms the allylic &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to the corresponding &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters.

      <title>Enzyme Instructed Self&#8208;assembly Enabled Monomer&#8208;excimer Transition to Construct Higher Ordered Luminescent Supramolecular Assembly for Activity&#8208;based Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>How to construct high&#8208;performing excimer&#8208;based luminescent analytic tools at low molecular concentrations remains a challenge.

Cou  was conjugated to short self&#8208;assembly peptides with a hydrophilic ALP&#8208;responsive group.  By ALP triggering, EISA actuated nanoparticles&#8208;nanofibers transition at low peptides concentrations  followed by monomer&#8208;excimer transition of  Cou  .  Analysis of structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that the self&#8208;assembly motif was a prerequisite for peptides to induce monomer&#8208;excimer transition of  Cou  .  Luminescent supramolecular nanofibers of  pYD  (  LSN&#8208;  pYD  ) illuminated the intercellular bridge of cancer cells and distinguished cancer cells (tissues) from normal cells (tissues) efficiently and rapidly, promising the potential use for early diagnosis of cancer.

      <dc:description>Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights were gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8208;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes are evaluated directly. We observe that (i) specific Pt dissolution is increasing significantly with decreasing Pt loading, (ii) in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments is considerably lower and, (iii) by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution is reduced even further.

      <title>Electrochemiluminescence loss in photobleaching</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of photobleaching on electrochemi&#173;luminescence (ECL) was investigated for the first time. The plasma membrane of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was labeled with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative. Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) or Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) methods.</dc:description>

ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) or Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to  s  &#8208;block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of  s  Bu  2  Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R = 2&#8208;ethylhexyl), where unusually both  s  Bu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2&#8208;FG&#8208;C  6  H  4  )  2  (OR)}  2  ] (FG= OMe; NMe  2  ) or a homoaryl [(THF)  4  Li  2  Mg(4&#8208;FG&#8208;C  6  H  4  )  4  ] (FG= OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk&#8208;type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMg  s  Bu  2  (OR)], alkyl rich [Li  2  Mg  s  Bu  4  ] and Mg(OR)  2  , with [Li  2  Mg  s  Bu  4  ] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Adsorption&#8208;Driven Mechanism for MOFs&#8208;Based Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanostructures</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures have drawn enormous attention recently due to their multifunctionality. However, the regulations of the size and morphology of yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures are still limited by the unclear formation mechanism. Herein, we first demonstrated a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing yolk&#8208;shelled MOFs&#8208;based nanostructures coated with mesoporous SiO2  shells (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2  ) with tunable size and morphology. The selective and competitive adsorption of methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) on ZIF&#8208;8 core were found to have decisive effects on inducing the morphology evolution of yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures. The obtained yolk&#8208;shelled ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2  nanostructures show great promise in generating acoustic cavitation effect for sonodynamic cancer therapy  in vitro  . We believe that this work will not only help us to design novel MOFs&#8208;based yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures, but also promote the widespread application of MOFs materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>2D perovskites with chemical formula A&#8242;  2  A  n&#8722;1  B  n  X  3n+1  have recently attracted considerable attention due to their tunable optical and electronic properties by varying the chemical composition.

In this study, we demonstrated a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesize monodisperse 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite through kinetic control. We found that casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium would promote selective formation of the kinetic product, multi&#8208;layer 2D perovskite, in preference to the single layer thermodynamic one. The resulted n&#8208;specific layer 2D perovskites show a trend where decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Approach for Monolayer Adsorption of High Weight Loadings of Uniform Nanocrystals on Oxide Supports</title>
      <dc:description>Monodispersed metal and semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research due to their tunable size, morphology, and well&#8208;defined chemical composition. Utilizing these nanocrystals in a controllable way is highly desirable especially when using them as building blocks for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Their deposition onto oxide materials provide them with wide applicability in many areas, including catalysis. However, so far deposition methods are limited and do not provide control to achieve high particle loadings. This study demonstrates a general approach for the deposition of hydrophobic ligand&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on hydrophilic oxide supports without ligand&#8208;exchange. Surface functionalization of the supports with primary amine groups either using an organosilane ((3&#8208;aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane) or bonding with aminoalcohols (3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol) were found to significantly improve the interaction between nanocrystals and supports achieving high loadings (&gt;10 wt. %). The bonding method with aminoalcohols guarantees the opportunity to remove the binding molecules thus allowing clean metal/oxide materials to be obtained, which is of great importance in the preparation of supported nanocrystals for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>A MOF&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;Strong Acetylene Nano&#8208;trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Porous materials with open metal sites have been extensively investigated to separate various gas mixtures in the last decades. However, compared with the multiple binding sites, the current open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C  2  H  2  /CO  2  , which have very similar physical properties. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C  2  H  2  nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C  2  H  2  molecules and separate C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark  Q  st  of 79.1 kJ mol  &#8208;1  for C  2  H  2  , a record high pure C  2  H  2  uptake of 2.54 mmol g  &#8208;1  at 1&#215;10  &#8208;2  bar, and the highest C  2  H  2  /CO  2  selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C  2  H  2  and the separation of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  . The locations of C  2  H  2  molecules within the MOF&#8208;based nanotrap have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C  2  H  2  . Our work not only provides a record C  2  H  2  adsorbent but also suggests a new approach to construct efficient separation materials based on synergistic effect.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient n&#8208;Doping of Polymeric Semiconductors through Controlling the Dynamics of Solution&#8208;State Polymer Aggregates</title>
      <dc:description>Doping of polymeric semiconductors is often limited by the miscibility issue between polymers and dopants.  Although significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the miscibility via chemical modification, the electrical conductivities of n&#8208;doped polymeric semiconductors are usually below 10 S cm  &#8722;1  . Here, we report a different approach to overcome the miscibility issue by modulating the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers. We found that the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers not only change with solvent and temperature but also change with solution aging time. Modulating the solution&#8208;state polymer aggregates can directly influence their solid&#8208;state microstructures and miscibility with dopants. As a result, both high doping efficiency and high charge carrier mobility were simultaneously obtained.  The n&#8208;doped electrical conductivity of P(PzDPP&#8208;CT2)  can be tuned up to 32.1 S cm  &#8722;1  after exploring the dynamics of the polymer aggregates. This method can also be used to improve the doping efficiency of other polymer systems (e.g. N2200) with different aggregation tendencies and behaviors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the polymer aggregates and the influence on the solid&#8208;state microstructures and doping efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>Auxetic Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanostructures from DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Architectured materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with regular materials.

The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by top&#8208;down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. Here we demonstrate two&#8208;dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations are performed by two&#8208;step DNA reactions and complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics simulations.

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of photoelectrochemical DNA biosensing using plasmonic DNA barcodes and differential signal readout</title>
      <dc:description>PEC biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices. We developed a new PEC biosensing strategy that uses differential signal generation, combining signals from two separate but correlated binding events on the biosensor, for improving the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection, sensitivity, and specificity of PEC DNA biosensors in biological samples. In this assay, the binding of unlabeled target DNA is followed by the capture of a signal amplification barcode featuring a plasmonic nanoparticle. The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15 and three times, respectively, compared to the previously&#8208;used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 3 fM.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Redox Mechanism of Low&#8208;Temperature NH3&#8208;SCR over Cu&#8208;CHA:&#160;A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Reduction Half Cycle</title>
      <dc:description>Cu&#8208;CHA is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of e.g., nature of active Cu&#8208;ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Here we address the redox mechanism underlying low&#8208;temperature (LT) SCR on Cu&#8208;CHA via an unprecedented integration of chemical&#8208;trapping techniques, transient&#8208;response methods, operando UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the reduction half&#8208;cycle (RHC) of LT&#8208;SCR display a quadratic dependence on Cu  II  , thus questioning single&#8208;site mechanisms based on isolated Cu  II  &#8208;ions. We propose, instead, a Cu  II  &#8208;pair mediated LT&#8208;RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite&#8208;precursor intermediates accounts for Cu  II  reduction. These results highlight for the first time the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT&#8208;SCR, but also in the RHC cascade.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cu&#8208;CHA is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of e.g., nature of active Cu&#8208;ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Here we address the redox mechanism underlying low&#8208;temperature (LT) SCR on Cu&#8208;CHA via an unprecedented integration of chemical&#8208;trapping techniques, transient&#8208;response methods, operando UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the reduction half&#8208;cycle (RHC) of LT&#8208;SCR display a quadratic dependence on Cu  II  , thus questioning single&#8208;site mechanisms based on isolated Cu  II  &#8208;ions. We propose, instead, a Cu  II  &#8208;pair mediated LT&#8208;RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite&#8208;precursor intermediates accounts for Cu  II  reduction. These results highlight for the first time the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT&#8208;SCR, but also in the RHC cascade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Defect&#8208;assisted Loading and Docking Conformations of Pharmaceuticals in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The understanding of drug&#8208;carrier interactions is essential for the design and applications of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based drug delivery systems. While such drug&#8208;carrier interactions can be fundamentally different for MOFs with or without defects. In this work, we revealed that the defects in MOFs play a key role in the loading of many pharmaceuticals with phosphate or phosphonate groups. The host&#8208;guest interaction is dominated by the Coulombic attraction between phosphate/phosphonate groups and defect sites and it strongly enhances the loading capacity. For similar molecules without a phosphate/phosphonate group or for MOF without defects, the loading capacity is greatly reduced.

      <title>Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysis in MoS2 monolayer activated by long&#8208;range ferromagnetism: beyond the single&#8208;atom catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysts with fully activated basal&#8208;atoms will provide an ultimate solution to the low loading&#8208;density bottleneck of single&#8208;atom catalysts. Herein, we propose a strategy to activate the majority of basal sites of monolayer MoS  2  , by doping Co ions to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. This strategy, as revealed by  in&#8208;situ  synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50% of the originally inert basal&#8208;plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction.  Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS  2  measured by on&#8208;chip micro&#8208;cell, a &#160;current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  could be achieved at the overpotential of 137 mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571 A g  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. The exchange current density of 75 &#956;A cm  &#8208;2  for the monolayer also surpasses most of other MoS  2  &#8208;based catalysts reported so far. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that the activation of basal plane S atoms is due to the delocalization of spin states of  d  &#8208;electron and the increase of S&#8208;  p  electronic density around the Fermi level, and hence promotes the H adsorption ability of basal&#8208;plane S atoms.</dc:description>

      <title>Amine&#8208;to&#8208;azide conversion on native RNA via metal&#8208;free diazo transfer opens new avenues&#160;for RNA manipulations</title>
      <dc:description>A major challenge in the field of RNA chemistry is the identification of selective and quantitative conversion reactions on RNA that can be used for tagging and any other RNA tool development. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA containing an aliphatic primary amino group using the diazotizing reagent fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO  2  N  3  ). The reaction provides the corresponding azide&#8208;modified RNA in nearly quantitatively yields without affecting the nucleobase amino groups. The obtained azido&#8208;RNA can then be further processed utilizing well&#8208;established bioorthogonal reactions such as azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (Click) or Staudinger ligations. We exemplify the robustness of this approach for the synthesis of peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics and for the pull&#8208;down of acp  3  U and k  2  C containing tRNAs of the&#160;  E.coli  tRNA pool isolated from cellular extracts.

      <title>Seven&#8208;step Synthesis of All&#8208;nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015141), Takaaki Sato, Noritaka Chida et&#8197;al. report synthesis, transformation, and biological tests of ANS derivatives. The key to success is a seven&#8208;step synthesis of ANSs by the sequential Overman rearrangement enabling formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups.

      <title>Quantification of Redox Sites during Catalytic Propane Oxychlorination by Operando EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Operando EPR gets hot: In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013331), Guido Zichittella, Yevhen Polyhach, Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez et&#8197;al. demonstrate operando EPR spectroscopy as a pivotal technique to assess the oxidation state of CrPO4 and EuOCl catalysts during high&#8208;temperature catalytic propane oxychlorination. As depicted in the cover, this enables the quantification of catalytically active centers, as the redox couple Cr3+&#160;(gold)/Cr2+&#160;(lilac), whose formation was correlated with the productivity of propylene.

      <title>Phenotypic Discovery of Neuroprotective Agents by Regulation of Tau Proteostasis via Stress&#8208;Responsive Activation of PERK Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as tau protein. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013915), Seung&#8197;Bum Park et&#8197;al. perform a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening and identify a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal assembly of tau protein under the ER stress. The label&#8208;free target identification and mode of action studies revealed that SB1617 treatment leads to the restoration of proteostasis in a stress&#8208;responsive manner.

      <dc:description>
Introduction of chirality in a metal&#8211;organic framework built from achiral precursors through achiral template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is demonstrated by Qihui Chen, Maochun Hong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013885). The driving force for chirality generation is a template&#8208;driven kinetically controlled assembly process. The chirality generation process was identified in detail through transition state capture.

      <title>Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Poly(Tetrazine)&#8208;co&#8208;Fluorene&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Series of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
The ability to post&#8208;synthetically functionalize conjugated polymers by &#8220;plugging&#8221; various structures into the polymer backbone is demonstrated in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010795) by Alex Adronov et&#8197;al. using inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) chemistry on a poly(tetrazine) polymer backbone. A small library of polymers was rapidly prepared by reacting a series of trans&#8208;cyclooctyne derivatives with the poly(tetrazine).

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Bistability in a Ni&#8211;Fe Chain: Electron Transfer Controlled by Temperature, Pressure, Light, and Humidity</title>
      <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are important for the construction of molecular switches or sensors. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012876), Mateusz Reczy&#324;ski, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi, Beata Nowicka and co&#8208;workers present room temperature bistability in a CN&#8208;bridged Ni&#8211;Fe coordination chain, which exhibits multiresponsive behavior with electron&#8208;transfer transitions induced by temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. The material responds to these stimuli with measurable changes in magnetic properties and color.
