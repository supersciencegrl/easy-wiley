         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their application is limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and negatively shift the redox potentials of quinone material. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7 meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex&#8208;situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500 cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Oxidized Tr&#246;ger's Base Macrocyclic Arenes: Unprecedented Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high enantioselectivity with synthetic receptors, particularly in water, remains a significant challenge despite the success seen in natural biological systems. In this study, we introduce a facile synthesis of Tr&#246;ger's base (TB)&#8208;containing macrocyclic arenes (TBn), where TB units are linked via methylene bridges, providing the macrocycles with a rigid framework. Oxidation of enantiopure TBn yields corresponding chiral nitrogen oxides (TBnNO) with excellent water solubility, attributed to the high polarity of the N&#8208;O bond, surpassing the pH limitations of traditional ion&#8208;functionalized approaches. Remarkably, TBnNO exhibits exceptional enantioselective recognition toward a wide range of chiral guests in aqueous solution, achieving enantioselectivities as high as 41.0. The underlying mechanism involves a combination of hydrophobic interactions and steric effects caused by rigid chiral cavities. These findings highlight the potential of nitrogen&#8208;oxidized macrocycles as a transformative tool for supramolecular application in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Cluster&#8208;based Spin Crossover Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster&#8208;based spin crossover (SCO) frameworks are a new class of smart metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse structures and topologies and unique bistable physicochemical properties. Here, we report a cluster&#8208;based SCO framework [Fe3{Ag4(CN)6(H2O)}2(TPBA)3](ClO4)2&#183;7DMF (1) with an extremely rare 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology, in which the tripodal [Ag{Ag(CN)2}3(H2O)]2&#8722; clusters axially link the Fe2+ ions to form 2D&#8594;3D n&#8208;fold Borromean entangled networks. Under the guidance of reticular chemistry, the post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) from 1 with 3,4,6&#8208;T108 topology to [Fe3{Ag8X8(CN)6}(TPBA)3] (2_X, X = Cl, Br, I) with urk topology is firstly achieved via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Moreover, the successive SCSC transformations from 2_Cl to 2_Br and then to 2_I are realized for the first time. Their SCO behaviors are also modified by halogen&#8208;driven stepwise cluster transformations. Hence, these findings provide new strategies for the development of cluster&#8208;based SCO MOFs towards the smart functional porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unleashed Remarkable Energy Storage Performance in Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;based Relaxor Ferroelectrics by Local Structural Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric capacitors harvest energy through an electrostatic&#160;process, which enables an ultrafast charging&#8208;discharging rate and ultrahigh power density. However, achieving high energy density (Wrec) and efficiency (&#951;) simultaneously, especially when preserving them across a wide frequency/temperature range or cycling numbers, remains challenging. In this work, by especially introducing NaTaO3 into the representative ferroelectric relaxor of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3&#8208;Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 and leveraging the mismatch between B&#8208;site atoms, we proposed a method of enhancing local structural fluctuation to refine the polar configuration and to effectively improve its overall energy&#8208;storage performances. As a consequence, the ceramic exhibits an ultrahigh Wrec of 15.0 J/cm3 and high &#951; up to 80%, along with a very wide frequency stability of 10 &#8211; 200 Hz and extensive cycling number up to 108. In&#8208;depth local structure and chemical environment investigations, consisting of atom&#8208;scale electron microscopy, neutron total scattering, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, reveal that the randomly distributed A/B&#8208;site atom pairs emerge in the system, leading to the evident local structural fluctuations and concomitant polymorphic polar nanodomains. These key ingredients contribute to the large polarization, minimal hysteresis, and high breakdown strength, thereby promoting energy&#8208;storage performances. This work opens a new path for designing high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors via manipulating local structural fluctuations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromative Dephosphinidenation of a Bisphosphirane&#8208;Fused Anthracene toward E&#8722;H (E=H, Si, N and P) Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating a bulky amino substituent at phosphorous enables the development of a bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene. This compound serves as an efficient phosphinidene synthon, thermally releasing transient phosphinidenes shown to activate dihydrogen (H2), E&#8722;H (E=Si, N and P) bonds and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A bisphosphirane&#8208;fused anthracene (5) was prepared by treatment of a sterically encumbered amino phosphorus dichloride (3) with MgA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF3 (A=anthracene). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a pentacyclic framework consisting of 5 with two phosphirane rings fused to the anthracene in a trans&#8208;fashion. Compound 5 has been shown to be an efficient phosphinidene synthon, readily liberating two transient phosphinidene units for subsequent downstream bond activation via the reductive elimination of anthracene under mild conditions. The formal oxidative addition of H2 and E&#8722;H (E=Si, N, P) bonds by the liberated phosphinidene provided diphosphine and substituted phosphines. Furthermore, phosphinidene transfer to alkenes and alkynes smoothly yielded the corresponding phosphiranes and phosphirenes. The mechanism of the H2 activation by 5 was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol&#160;Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that&#160;of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters:&#160; collective rearrangements are&#160;3 times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can&#160;boost&#160;reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to CH3OH emerges as a promising strategy to sustainably utilize natural gas and mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, there remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of methanol by using O2 at low temperature. Inspired by the catalytic structure in soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) and the corresponding reaction mechanism, we prepared a biomimetic photocatalysts with the decoration of Fe2O3 nanocluster and satellite Fe single atom immobilized on carbon nitride. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity of 5.02 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with methanol selectivity of 98.5%. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergy between Fe2O3 nanocluster and Fe single atom establishes a dual&#8208;Fe site as MMO for O2 activation and subsequent CH4 partial oxidation. Moreover, the light excitation of Fe2O3&#160;nanoclusters with a relative narrow bandgap could deliver the electrons and protons to atomic Fe that facilitating the oxygen reduction kinetics for the robust of methanol synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhomogeneous Coordination in High&#8208;entropy O3&#8208;type Cathodes Enables Suppressed Slab Gliding and Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O3&#8208;type layered oxides are highly promising cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), however they undergo complex phase transitions and exhibit high sensibility to air, leading to subpar cycling performance and commercial viability. In this work, we report a layered cathode material (NaNi0.29Cu0.1Mg0.05Li0.05Mn0.2Ti0.2Sn0.11O2) with a sate&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;entropy compositional design. We unveil that such a configuration featuring inhomogeneous coordination environment of transition metal (TM) elements, can enable enhanced gliding energy (&#8208;0.38 vs &#8208;0.58 eV) of TMO2 slabs upon desodiation both theoretically and experimentally, which underlies the fundamental origin of the outstanding structural stability of HEO materials. As a consequence, the complex phase transitions (O3&#8208;O'3&#8208;P3&#8208;P'3&#8208;P3'&#8208;O3') of conventional O3&#8208;type cathode have been eliminated, and the as&#8208;obtained material demonstrates exceptional structural robustness and integrity with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life in a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cell (maintaining 73.2% capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C). Moreover, the material presents satisfactory air stability, with minimal structural and electrochemical degradation when directly exposed to the air. An Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell based on the cathode material is constructed, demonstrating a capacity retention of 83.6% after 500 cycles, signaling substantial promise for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strontium Doped IrOx Triggers Direct O&#8208;O Coupling to Boost Acid Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2&#8208;assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium&#8208;doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8208;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8208;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8208;IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8208;IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72 V at 1 A cm&#8208;2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500 hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;assembly Based on a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer towards Amplified Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have been attaching wide attention in the field of optical information storage and encryption, while still facing the challenge of the realization of high&#160;luminescence dissymmetry&#160;factors (glum). This work presents a pair of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral co&#8208;assemblies P7R3 and P7S3 by combining polymer PFIQ containing iso&#8208;quinoline units with chiral inducers. The obtained chiral co&#8208;assemblies can reversibly undergo significant modification in CPL behavior under trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) fumigation and annealing treatment, with the |glum| values exhibiting a reversible shift between 0.2 and 0.3. Moreover, the chiral co&#8208;assemblies before TFA fumigating can effectively induce achiral emitters to generate intense full&#8208;color CPL signals through CPL energy transfer (CPL&#8208;ET), with the corresponding |glum| values larger than 0.2. Moreover, information encryption and decryption as well as a multi&#8208;level logic gates application are achieved by leveraging the reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL activity of the chiral co&#8208;assembly. This work provides a new perspective for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral luminescent materials with large |glum| values and the activation of CPL behavior in achiral emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Fluorescence Polyelectrolyte Nanoassemblies: Manipulate and Boost Singlet Oxygen in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved therapeutic modality that has shown great potential for cancer treatment. However, there exist two major problems hindering PDT applications: the nonspecific phototoxicity requiring patients to stay in dark post&#8208;PDT, and the limited photodynamic efficiency. Herein, we report a photo&#8208;triggered porphyrin polyelectrolyte nanoassembling (photo&#8208;triggered PPN) strategy, in which porphyrin photosensitizer and photoswitchable energy accepter are assembled into polyelectrolyte micelles by a combined force of charge interaction and metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The polyelectrolyte&#8208;based PPN exhibits good biocompatibility, and bestows a unique "confining isolated" inner microenvironment for fully overcoming the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of porphyrins with significant photodynamic efficiency (123&#8208;fold enhancement). Due to the high F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (91.5%) between porphyrin and photoswitch in closed&#8208;form, we could use light as a specific trigger to modulate photoswitch between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;form, and manipulate the 1O2 generation in three stages: pre&#8208;PDT (quenching 1O2 generation), during PDT (activating 1O2 generation), and post&#8208;PDT (silencing 1O2 generation). This de novo strategy has for the first time realized remotely manipulating and boosting 1O2 generation in PDT, well resolving the critical and general challenges of limited photodynamic efficiency and side effects from nonspecific phototoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Dipoles Tailoring Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Chemistry to Enable Reversible Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a decisive role in building reliable Li metal batteries. However, the scarcity of anions in Helmholtz layer (HL) caused by electrostatic repulsion usually leads to the inferior SEI derived from solvents, resulting in dendrites and &#8216;dead&#8217; Li. Therefore, regulating the distribution of anions in electric double layer (EDL) and continuously introducing more anions into HL to tailor anions&#8208;derived SEI is crucial for achieving stable Li plating/stripping. Herein, by jointly utilizing the controlled defects of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the oriented dipoles of ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO), the rGO&#8208;BTO composite layer sustainedly brings more TFSI&#8208; and NO3&#8208; into anion&#8208;defecient HL, promoting favorable decomposition of anions and guiding the generation of robust and fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;transport SEI containing more inorganics LiF and Li3N species. Thus, the resulting Li deposit shows smooth and dense morphologies without dendrites, leading to high average Coulombic efficiency. The Li//Cu@rGO&#8208;BTO (10 mAh cm&#8208;2 plated Li) cell exhibits an enhanced Li plating/stripping stability (2700 h) and a higher rate capability. The LiFePO4 full cell (N/P=~6.3) using rGO&#8208;BTO displays an enhanced capacity retention (82.0% @ 430 cycles). This work provides a new insight on the construction of robust SEI by regulating the distribution of anions within EDL.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Stable and Energy&#8208;dense Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free from strategically important elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are heralded as promising low&#8208;cost and sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems that complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the reported electrochemical performance of PIBs is still suboptimal, especially under practically relevant battery manufacturing conditions. The primary challenge stems from the lack of electrolytes capable of concurrently supporting both the low&#8208;voltage anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability. Herein, we report a promising electrolyte that facilitates the commercially mature graphite anode (&gt; 3 mAh cm&#8208;2) to achieve an initial CE of 91.14% (with an average cycling CE around 99.94%), fast redox kinetics, and negligible capacity fading for hundreds of cycles. Meanwhile, the electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with the 4.4 V (vs. K+/K) high&#8208;voltage K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] (KMF) cathode. Consequently, the KMF||graphite full&#8208;cell without precycling treatment of both electrodes can provide an average discharge voltage of 3.61 V with a specific energy of 316.5 Wh kg&#8208;1&#8208;(KMF+graphite), comparable to the LiFePO4||graphite LIBs, and maintain 71.01% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control over the movement of electrons during chemical reactions with oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) has been predicted to offer a general approach to catalysis. Recently, we suggested that many problems to realize electric&#8208;field catalysis in practice under scalable bulk conditions could possibly be solved on multiwalled carbon nanotubes in electromicrofluidic reactors. Here, we selected monoterpene cyclizations to assess the scope of our system in organic synthesis. We report that electric&#8208;field catalysis can function by stabilizing both anionic and cationic transition states, depending on the orientation of the applied field. Moreover, electric&#8208;field catalysis can promote reactions which are barely accessible by general Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids and field&#8208;free anion&#8208;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, and drive chemoselectivity toward intrinsically disfavored products without the need for pyrene interfacers attached to the substrate to prolong binding to the carbon nanotubes. Finally, interfacing with chiral organocatalysts is explored and evidence against contributions from redox chemistry is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of High&#8208;Valent Molecular Cobalt Sites through Oxidized Phosphorus in Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous molecular cobalt (Co) sites represent one type of classical catalytic sites for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. There are dynamic equilibriums between Co2+, Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with OH&#8722;/H+ interaction before and during the OER event. Since the emergence of Co2+ sites is detrimental to the OER cycle, the stabilization of high&#8208;valent Co sites to shift away from the equilibrium becomes critical and is proposed as a new strategy to enhance OER. Herein, phosphorus (P) atoms were doped into reduced graphene oxide to link molecular Co2+ acetylacetonate toward synthesizing a novel heterogeneous molecular catalyst. By increasing the oxidation states of P heteroatoms, the linked Co sites were spontaneously oxidized from 2+ to 3+ states in a KOH solution through OH&#8722; ions coupling at an open circuit condition. With excluding the Co2+ sites, the as&#8208;derived Co sites with 3+ initial states exhibited intrinsically high OER activity, validating the effectiveness of the strategy of stabilizing high valence Co sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Naphthocyclinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>After half a century from their isolation in 1974, we report the first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, two dimeric pyranonaphthoquinones featuring an unusual bicyclo[3.2.1]&#8208;octadienone core. The syntheses were achieved with full stereochemical control and functional group management, relying on 1) enantioselective construction of the bicyclic core by Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition followed by thiolate&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization, and 2) judicious design of a common chiral, non&#8208;racemic monomer unit that is capable of divergence into the donor and acceptor units, and reunion to construct the bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone core.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving Structures of Paramagnetic Systems in Chemistry and Materials Science by Solid&#8208;State NMR: the Revolving Power of Ultra&#8208;Fast MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100+ kHz) has revolutionized solid&#8208;state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast&#8208;spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, and are associated with lower sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here these difficulties are overcome by improvements in rotor ceramics and handling methods that enable the routine use of this setup for repetitive, high&#8208;throughput analysis of sensitive samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra&#8208;fast 100+ kHz MAS allows site&#8208;specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. This opens the way to routine characterisation of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb3+ complex, an air&#8208;sensitive homogeneous high&#8208;spin Fe2+ catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe2+/Mn2+/Mg2+ olivine&#8208;type cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring d&#8209;Band Center of Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Sites for Boosted Photocatalytic Reduction of Diluted CO2 from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of diluted CO2 from anthropogenic sources holds tremendous potential for achieving carbon neutrality, while the huge barrier to forming *COOH key intermediate considerably limits catalytic effectiveness. Herein, via coordination engineering of atomically scattered Ni sites in conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs), we propose a facile strategy for tailoring the d&#8209;band center of metal active sites towards high&#8208;efficiency photoreduction of diluted CO2. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in pure CO2, CMOFs with Ni&#8208;O4 sites (Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs) exhibits an outstanding rate for CO generation of 13.3 &#956;mol h&#8211;1 with a selectivity of 94.5%, which is almost double that of its isostructural counterpart with traditional Ni&#8208;N4 sites (Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs), outperforming most reported systems under comparable conditions. Interestingly, in simulated flue gas, the CO selectivity of Ni&#8208;N4 CMOFs decreases significantly while that of Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs is mostly unchanged, signifying the supremacy for Ni&#8208;O4 CMOFs in leveraging anthropogenic diluted CO2. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) investigations demonstrate that O coordination can move the center of the Ni sites' d&#8208;band closer to the Fermi level, benefiting the generation of *COOH key intermediate as well as the desorption of *CO and hence leading to significantly boosted activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Thin Zinc Electrodes Stabilized with Organobromine&#8208;Partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH Cluster Ions for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of thin zinc (Zn) anodes with a high depth of discharge is an effective strategy to increase the energy density of aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs), but challenged by the poor reversibility of Zn electrode due to the serious Zn&#8208;consuming side reactions at the Zn||electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce 2&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (BDOL) and methanol (MeOH) as electrolyte additive into aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the as&#8208;formulated electrolyte, BDOL with a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group (&#8722;CH2Br) tends to pair with the H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH complex, leading to the formation of organobromine&#8208;partnered H2O&#8722;Zn&#8722;MeOH cluster ions. During the Zn electrodeposition process, the formed ZnO&#8208;dominated by&#8208;products induce the polymerization of BDOL monomers, which are previously adsorbed on the electrode. As a result, a uniform dual&#8208;layer SEI with ZnO&#8208;dominated outer layer and polyether&#8208;dominated inner layer is built on the surface of Zn electrode. With such an in&#8208;situ formed dual&#8208;layer SEI, the Zn||Mg0.9Mn3O7&#183;2.7H2O pouch cell using a 10&#8208;um Zn anode (corresponding to a low negative to positive areal capacity ratio of 3.56) successfully operated for 300 cycles with a high capacity retention of 86%, promising a high practical energy density of &gt; 120 Wh/kg (based on the total mass of Zn and Mg0.9Mn3O7&#183;2.7H2O).</dc:description>

         <title>Building Ultrastrong, Tough and Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers from Multiblock Copolyesters via a &#8220;Reserve&#8208;Release&#8221; Crystallization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneously attaining high strength and toughness has been a significant challenge in designing thermoplastic elastomers, especially biodegradable ones. In this context, we present a class of biodegradable elastomers based on multiblock copolyesters that afford extraordinary strength, toughness, and low&#8208;strain resilience despite expedient chemical synthesis and sample processing. With the incorporation of the semi&#8208;crystalline soft block and the judicious selection of block periodicity, the thermoplastic materials feature low quiescent crystallinity (&#8220;reserve&#8221;) albeit with vast potential for strain&#8208;induced crystallization (&#8220;release&#8221;), resulting in their significantly enhanced ultimate strength and energy&#8208;dissipating capabilities. Moreover, a breadth of mechanical responses of the materials &#8211; from reinforced elastomers to shape&#8208;memory materials to toughened thermoplastics &#8211; can be achieved by orthogonal variation of segment lengths and ratios. This work and the &#8220;reserve&#8208;release&#8221; crystallization strategy herein highlight the double crystalline multiblock chain architecture as a potential avenue towards reconciling the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off in thermoplastic elastomers and can possibly be extended to other biodegradable building blocks to deliver functional materials with diverse mechanical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>End&#8208;extended Conjugation Strategy to Reduce the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Mechanical Robustness Gap in Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concurrently achieving high efficiency, mechanical robustness and thermal stability is critical for the commercialization of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (APSCs). However, APSCs usually demonstrate complicated morphology, primarily attributed to the polymer chain entanglement which has a detrimental effect on their fill factors (FF) and morphology stability. To address these concerns, an end&#8208;group extended polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;NFT, was synthesized and studied. The morphology analysis showed a tightly ordered molecular packing mode and a favorable phase separation was formed. The PM6:PY&#8208;NFT&#8208;based device achieved an exceptional PCE of 19.12% (certified as 18.45%), outperforming the control PM6:PY&#8208;FT devices (17.14%). This significant improvement highlights the record&#8208;high PCE for binary APSCs. The thermal aging study revealed that the PM6:PY&#8208;NFT blend exhibited excellent morphological stability, thereby achieving superior device stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after enduring thermal stress (65 &#176;C) for 1500 hours. More importantly, the PM6:PY&#8208;NFT blend film exhibited outstanding mechanical ductility with a crack onset strain of 24.1%. Overall, rational chemical structure innovation, especially the conjugation extension strategy to trigger appropriate phase separation and stable morphology, is the key to achieving high efficiency, improved thermal stability and robust mechanical stability of APSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting WLED&#8208;Excited High Temperature Long Afterglow by Orthogonally Anchoring Chromophores into 0D Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow materials have garnered significant interest due to distinct photophysical characteristics. However, it is still difficult to achieve long afterglow phosphorescence from organic molecules due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and energy dissipation. In addition, most materials reported so far have long afterglow emission only at room or even low temperatures, and mainly use UV light as an excitation source. In this work, we report a strategy to achieve high temperature long afterglow emission through the assembly of isolated 0D metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). In which, both ACQ and phosphorescence quenching effects are effectively mitigated by altering the stacking mode of organic chromophores through orthogonally anchoring into the edges of cubic MOCs. Furthermore, improvement in molecular rigidity, promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling and broadening of the absorption range are achieved through the MOC&#8208; engineering strategy. As a result, we successfully synthesized MOCs that can produce afterglow emission even after excitation by WLEDs at high temperatures (380 K). Moreover, the MOCs are capable of generating afterglow emissions when excited by mobile phone flashlight at room temperature. Given these features, the potential applications of MOCs in the visual identification of explosives, information encryption and multicolor display are explored.</dc:description>

         <title>n&#8208;ZrS3/p&#8208;ZrOS Photoanodes with NiOOH/FeOOH Oxygen Evolution Catalysts for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical water splitting offers a promising approach for carbon neutrality, but its commercial prospects are still hampered by a lack of efficient and stable photoelectrodes with earth&#8208;abundant materials. Here, we report a strategy to construct an efficient photoanode with a coaxial nanobelt structure, comprising a buried&#8208;ZrS3/ZrOS n&#8208;p junction, for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The p&#8208;type ZrOS layer, formed on the surface of the n&#8208;type ZrS3 nanobelt through a pulsed&#8208;ozone&#8208;treatment method, acts as a hole collection layer for hole extraction and a protective layer to shield the photoanode from photocorrosion. The resulting ZrS3/ZrOS photoanode exhibits light harvesting with good photo&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiencies across the whole visible region to over 650&#8201;nm. By further employing NiOOH/FeOOH as the oxygen evolution reaction cocatalyst, the ZrS3/ZrOS/NiOOH/FeOOH photoanode yields a photocurrent density of ~9.3 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode with an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of ~3.2% under simulated sunlight irradiation in an alkaline solution (pH = 13.6). The conformal ZrOS layer enables ZrS3/ZrOS/NiOOH/FeOOH photoanode operation over 1000 hours in an alkaline solution without obvious performance degradation. This study, offering a promising approach to fabricate efficient and durable photoelectrodes with earth&#8208;abundant materials, advances the frontiers of photoelectrochemical water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>The Regulation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Composite Lithium Anodes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. However, the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal/SPE interface is a major challenge, as continuous SEI degradation and regeneration during cycling lead to capacity fading. This article investigates the SEI formation on lithium anodes (l&#8208;SEI) and composite lithium anodes (c&#8208;SEI) in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The composite anodes form a uniform Li2S&#8208;rich inorganic SEI layer and a thinner organic SEI layer, effectively passivating the interface for enhanced cycling stability. Specifically, the full cells with c&#8208;SEI anodes sustain over 400 cycles at 0.5 C under a high areal capacity of 2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the reversible high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state pouch cells exhibit exceptional safety even after curling and cutting. These findings offer valuable insights into developing composite electrodes with robust SEI for solid&#8208;state polymer&#8208;based lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Pore Wall Chemistry Empowers Sonodynamic Activity of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Pro&#8208;Oxidative Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered growing attracted interest in the field of biomedicine; however, their application in sonodynamic therapy remains underexplored due to limited understanding of their intrinsic activity and structure&#8208;property relationships. Here, we present a pore wall chemistry modulation strategy for empowering sonodynamic activity to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF heterojunctions through in situ growth of COFs on bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets (B NSs). Compared to the negligible sonodynamic effects observed in the pristine B NSs, the 2D heterojunction with vinyl&#8208;decorated COF pore walls demonstrates a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in sonocatalytic singlet oxygen generation. This performance also significantly outperforms that of isoreticular COFs functionalized with methoxy or non&#8208;substituted groups. Mechanistic studies reveal that the vinyl groups in the BC heterojunction facilitate the separation and transfer of charge carriers while also enhancing the adsorption of oxygen molecules. Furthermore, peroxymonosulfate (PMS) loading into the porous COFs boosts the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor nanotherapy via sonocatalytic dual oxidative species generation. These findings underscore the critical role of pore wall chemistry in modulating the sonocatalytic properties of COFs, and advance the development of COF&#8208;based sonosensitizers for pro&#8208;oxidative applications.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.







Abstract
Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine using in situ generated cyclohexanone species. Utilizing an optimal Cu catalyst, we achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 69.1&#8201;%, a formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a 97.5&#8201;% conversion rate of phenol to oxime. Additionally, a tandem catalytic route enabled the conversion of 4.0&#8197;g of lignin to 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon-6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1&#8201;% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0&#8197;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5&#8201;%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high-performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40&#8197;g of caprolactam from 4.0&#8197;g of lignin raw material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Mechanism of Anion and Cation Interaction on Ion Conduction of Polymer Based Electrolyte in Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer based electrolyte shows advantages in compatibly improving safety and interface stability of batteries, while its limited ion conductivity and transfer number make it difficult to apply it in batteries with high energy density. Herein, by designing four crosslinking polyesters with different electron withdrawing group (EWG), it is found that strengthening the binding of EWG to anion for weakening the binding of anion to Li+ is critical for high Li+ transfer number (tLi+) and ionic conductivity of electrolyte. As a result, poly(2,2,3,3&#8722;tetrafluoropropyl methacrylate) (PTFM) based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) shows an ionic conductivity of 0.78 mS cm&#8722;1 and a tLi+ of 0.85, much higher than those of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) without EWG. Moreover, PTFM based GPE shows excellent flame retardancy property. Li||PTFM||NCM811 batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 5.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 show stable cycles of 5 times to that of Li||PMMA||NCM811. Moreover, the assembled graphite||PTFM||NCM811 pouch cell shows a capacity retention rate of 92% after 500 cycles. This work clarifies the mechanism of cation||anion interaction on ionic conductivity of GPE, which is important to develop high&#8208;performance devices with good safety and flexibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;efficient Heat Transport across a &#8220;2.5D&#8221; All&#8208;carbon sp2/sp3 Hybrid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208; and few&#8208;layer graphene&#8208;based thermal interface materials (TIMs) with extraordinary high&#8208;temperature resistance and ultra&#8208;high thermal conductivity are very essential to develop the next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. However, the function of the as&#8208;prepared graphene&#8208;based TIMs would undergo severe degradation when being transferred to chips, as the interface between the TIMs and chips possesses a very small interfacial thermal conductance. Here, a &#8220;2.5D&#8221; all&#8208;carbon interface containing rich covalent bonding, namely a sp2/sp3 hybrid interfaces is designed and realized by a plasma&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition with a function of ultra&#8208;rapid quenching. The interfacial thermal conductance of the 2.5D interface is excitingly very high, up to 110&#8208;117 MWm&#8208;2K&#8208;1 at graphene thickness of 12&#8208;25 nm, which is even more than 30% higher than various metal/diamond contacts, and orders of magnitude higher than the existing all&#8208;carbon contacts. Atomic&#8208;level simulation confirm the key role of the efficient heat conduction via covalent C&#8208;C bonds, and reveal that the covalent&#8208;based heat transport could contribute 85% to the total interfacial conduction at a hybridization degree of 22 at%. This study provides an efficient strategy to design and construct 2.5D all&#8208;carbon interfaces, which can be used to develop high performance all&#8208;carbon devices and circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N Arylation using Alternating Polarity in Flow for Compound Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Etherification and amination of aryl halide scaffolds are commonly used reactions in parallel medicinal chemistry to rapidly scan structure&#8208;activity relationships with abundant building blocks. Electrochemical methods for aryl etherification and amination demonstrate broad functional group tolerance and extended nucleophile scope compared to traditional methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for robust and scale&#8208;transferable workflows for electrochemical compound library synthesis. Herein we describe a platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of C&#8208;X arylation (X = NH, OH) in flow to access compound libraries. A comprehensive Design of Experiment (DoE) study identifies an optimal protocol which generates high yields across &gt; 30 aryl halide scaffolds, diverse amines (including electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). Reaction sequences are automated on commercially available equipment to generate libraries of anilines and aryl ethers. The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid accumulating electrode passivation. Moreover, it enables reactions to be performed in air, without supporting electrolyte and with high reproducibility over consecutive runs. Our method represents a powerful means to rapidly generate nucleophile independent C&#8208;X arylation compound libraries using flow electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Bio Hybrids for Selective Photobiocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system (SAPS) that combines enzymes or cellular organisms with light&#8208;absorbing semiconductors, has emerged as an attractive approach for nitrogen conversion, yet faces the challenge of reaction pathway regulation. Herein, we find that photoelectrons can transfer from the &#8208;C&#8801;N groups at the edge of cyano&#8208;rich carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN) to nitrate reductase (NarGH), while the direct electron transfer to nitrite reductase (cd1NiR) is inhibited due to the physiological distance limit of active sites (&gt; 14 &#197;). By means of the directional electron transfer between g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN and extracted biological enzymes, the product of the denitrification reaction was switched from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3%. The converted nitrite could be further utilized by anammox microbiota and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) microorganisms, doubling the efficiency of total nitrogen removal (96.5 &#177; 2.3 %) for biological nitrogen removal and ammonia generation (12.6 mg NH4+&#8208;N L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), respectively. Thus, our work paves an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate for ammonia fuel production by strategically regulating the electron transfer pathway across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8208;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8208;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8208;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8208;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 || graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45 g Ah&#8208;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2% after 200 cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonds in Organic Cathode Materials to Realize Ultra&#8208;stable, Flexible and Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of molecular structures is one of the effective strategies to obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials. However, besides the optimization of single&#8208;molecule structures, the influence of the "weak" interaction forces (e.g. hydrogen bonds) in organic cathode materials on the performance of batteries should be fully considered. Herein, three organic small molecules with different numbers of hydroxyl groups (namely nitrogen heterocyclic tetraketone (DAB), monohydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (HDA), dihydroxyl nitrogen heterocyclic dione (DHT)) were selected as the cathodes of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), and the effect of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds on their electrochemical performance was studied for the first time. Clearly, the stable hydrogen&#8208;bond networks built through the hydroxyl groups significantly enhance the cycle stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes and facilitate rapid proton conduction between the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks through the Grotthuss mechanism, thereby endowing them with excellent rate performance. In addition, a larger and more dense two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bond network can be constructed through multiple hydroxyl groups, further enhancing the structural stability of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes, giving them better cycle tolerance, excellent rate performance, and extreme environmental tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Interfacial Assembly: Integrating Supramolecular Hosts into Polymeric Membranes through an Aqueous Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient incorporation of supramolecular hosts in polymeric membranes can impart the overall matrix with new properties for a range of cutting&#8208;edge applications. Here, we introduce a Supramolecular Interfacial Assembly (SIA) method for the fabrication of polymeric membranes featuring embedded macrocycles. Through harnessing the quasi&#8208;liquid nature of the concentrated polymer solution, SIA orchestrates the homogenous spreading of macrocycles in an aqueous layer on its surface, leading to the creation of an interface between &#8220;water/water&#8221; phases, subsequently forming a cross&#8208;linked membrane driven by supramolecular electrostatic interactions. Remarkably, compared to the traditional interfacial polymerization, SIA adheres to a &#8220;green&#8221; paradigm without the need for organic solvents. The resultant composite membrane exhibits superior performance in organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), owing to the precise molecular sieving property provided by the macrocycles with well&#8208;defined permanent cavities. This fabrication method holds great promise for the innovative design of composite membranes, which can greatly impact the production of smart membrane materials for advanced technology applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II  Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence Nanocrystals with 1710 nm Excitation for in vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anti&#8208;Stokes luminescence (ASL) based on lanthanide nanocrystals holds immense promise for in vivo optical imaging and bio&#8208;detection, which benefits from filtered autofluorescence. However, the current longest emission and excitation wavelengths of lanthanide ASL system were shorter than 1200 nm and 1532 nm, respectively, which limited tissue penetration depth and caused low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of in vivo imaging due to tissue scattering and water absorption. In this work, we extended the excitation wavelength to 1710 nm with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) emission up to 1650 nm through a novel ASL nanocrystal LiYF4:10%Tm@LiYF4:70%Er@LiYF4. Compared with 1532 nm excited ASL nanoprobes, the 1710 nm excited nanocrystals could improve in vivo imaging SNR by 12.72 folds. Based on this excellent imaging performance of the proposed ASL nanoprobes, three&#8208;channel in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging was achieved, which quantitatively revealed metabolic rates of intestinal dynamics and liver enrichment under anesthetized and awake states. This innovative ASL nanoprobes and dynamic multiplexed imaging technology would be conducive to optimizing dosing regimen and treatment plans across various physiological conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Active Sites with Charge&#8208;asymmetry in Organic Semiconductors Promoting C&#8208;C Coupling for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and energy shortage, but it is still highly challenging due to the large energy barrier of the C&#8208;C coupling step and severe exciton annihilation in photocatalysts. Herein, strong and localized charge polarization is successfully induced on the surface of melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors by creating dual active sites with a large charge asymmetry. Confirmed by multiscale characterization and theoretical simulations, such asymmetric charge distribution, originated from the oxygen dopants and nitrogen vacancies over melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors, reduces exciton binding energy and boosts exciton dissociation. The as&#8208;formed charge polarization sites not only donate electrons to CO2 molecules but also accelerate the coupling of asymmetric *CO*CO intermediates for CO2 photoreduction into ethanol by lowering the energy barrier of this process. Consequently, an exceptionally high selectivity of up to 97% for C2H5OH and C2H5OH yield of 0.80 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 have been achieved on this dual active sites organic semiconductor. This work, with its potential applicability to a variety of non&#8208;metal multi&#8208;site catalysts, represents a versatile strategy for the development of advanced catalysts tailored for CO2 photoreduction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>MicroRNA&#8208;Triggered Programmable DNA&#8208;Encoded Pre&#8208;PROTACs for Cell&#8208;Selective and Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have accelerated drug development; however, some challenges still exist owing to their lack of tumor selectivity and on&#8208;demand protein degradation. Here, we developed a miRNA&#8208;initiated assembled pre&#8208;PROTAC (miRiaTAC) platform that enables the on&#8208;demand activation and termination of target degradation in a cell type&#8208;specific manner. Using miRNA&#8208;21 as a model, we engineered DNA hairpins labeled with JQ&#8208;1 and pomalidomide and facilitated the modular assembly of DNA&#8208;encoded pre&#8208;PROTACs through a hybridization chain reaction. This configuration promoted the selective polyubiquitination and degradation of BRD4 upon miR&#8208;21 initiation, highlighting significant tumor selectivity and minimal systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the platform incorporates photolabile groups, enabling the precise optical control of pre&#8208;PROTACs during DNA assembly/disassembly, mitigating the risk of excessive protein degradation. Additionally, by introducing a secondary ligand targeting CDK6, these pre&#8208;PROTACs were used as a modular scaffold for the programmable assembly of active miRiaTACs containing two different warheads in exact stoichiometry, enabling orthogonal multitarget degradation. The integration of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy through an upconversion nanosystem further enhanced the efficacy of the platform with potent in vivo anticancer activity. We anticipate that miRiaTAC represents a significant intersection between dynamic DNA nanotechnology and PROTAC, potentially expanding the versatility of PROTAC toolkit for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High Efficiency Alkaline Iodine Batteries with Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Enabled by Bi/Bi2O3 Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;electron transfer I&#8208;/IO3&#8208; redox couple is attractive for high energy aqueous batteries. Shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte significantly enhances the IO3&#8208; formation kinetics due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction, while the alkaline environment also offers more favorable Zn anode compatibility. However, sluggish kinetics during the reduction of IO3&#8208; persists in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, compromising the energy efficiency of this glorious redox couple. Here, we establish the fundamental redox mechanism of the I&#8208;/IO3&#8208; couple in alkaline electrolytes for the first time and propose that Bi/Bi2O3 acts as a redox mediator (RM) to &#8220;catalyze&#8221; the reduction of IO3&#8208;. This mediation significantly reduces the voltage gap between charge/discharge from 1.6 V to 1 V with improved conversion efficiency and rate capability. By pairing the Zn anode and the Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode, the full battery with I&#8208;/IO3&#8208; redox mechanism achieves high areal capacity of 12 mAh cm&#8208;2 and stable operation at 5 mAh cm&#8208;2 for over 400 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Phase Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;Situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem solid&#8208;solution phase post&#8208;synthetic modifications were realized based on porous molecular crystals. The sequential reactions involve addition reaction with hydrazine hydrate and condensation reaction with alkyl aldehydes, resulting in the production of three molecular frameworks in a quantitative manner, accompanied by solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow).







Abstract
Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution phase reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol with O2 over Photoinduced Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich WO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct photocatalytic conversion of benzene to phenol with O2 is a green alternative to the traditional synthesis. The key is to find an effective photocatalyst to do the trick. Defect engineering of semiconductors with oxygen vacancies (OVs) is an emerging strategy for catalyst fabrication. OVs can trap electrons to promote charge separation and serving as adsorption sites for O2 activation. However,&#160;randomly distribution of OVs on the semiconductor surface often results in mismatching the charge carrier dynamics under irradiation, thus failing to fulfill the unique advantages of OVs for photoredox functions. Herein, we demonstrate that abundant OVs can be facilely generated and precisely located adjacent to the reductive sites on reducible oxide semiconductors such as tungsten oxide (WO3) via a simple photochemistry strategy. Such photoinduced OVs are well suited for photocatalytic benzene oxidation with O2 as they readily capture photogenerated electrons from the reductive sites of WO3 to activate adsorbed O2. 18O&#8208;labeling experiments further confirm that the OVs also facilitate the integration of oxygen atoms from O2 into phenol, revealing in detail the pathway for photocatalytic benzene hydroxylation. This study demonstrates that the photochemistry approach is an appealing strategy for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance OVs&#8208;rich photocatalysts for solar&#8208;induced chemical conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Atomically&#8208;Precise Pt Sites for Boosting Light&#8208;Driven Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic structure of Pt single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitates robust electronic interactions with the substrate, providing an optimal spatial and electronic framework for activating and converting CO2&#8722;CH4 molecules. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, highlighting the critical role of atomically&#8208;precise interface adjustment in multi&#8208;molecule systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane is a promising and mild route to convert two greenhouse gas into valuable syngas. However, developing facile strategy to atomically&#8208;precise regulate the active sites and realize balanced and stable syngas production is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spatial confinement approach to precisely control over platinum species on TiO2 surfaces, from single atoms to nanoclusters. The configuration comprising single atoms and sub&#8208;nanoclusters engenders pronounced electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, with resultant interfacial states prompting surface charge rearrangement. The unique geometric and electronic properties of these atom&#8208;cluster assemblies facilitate effective activation of CH4 and CO2, accelerating intermediate coupling and minimizing side reactions. Our catalyst exhibits an outstanding syngas generation rate of 34.41&#8197;mol&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with superior durability, displaying high apparent quantum yield of 9.1&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and turnover frequency of 1289&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work provides insightful understanding for exploring more multi&#8208;molecule systems at an atomic scale.

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH 1&#8208;14 as amides and from pH 1&#8208;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Importing Atomic Rare&#8208;Earth Sites to Activate Lattice Oxygen of Spinel Oxides for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare&#8208;earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce&#8208;O&#8208;M (M: Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4. The developed Ce&#8208;NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce&#8208;NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as further verified by pH&#8208;dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis.&#160;18O&#8208;labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry directly demonstrates that oxygen originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce&#8208;NiCo2O4 during OER. It is discovered that electron delocalization of Ce 4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni&#8208;O bonding in [Ce&#8208;O&#8208;Ni] site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinel oxides have emerged as highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to covalency competition, the OER process on spinel oxides often follows an arduous adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway. Herein, we propose a novel rare-earth sites substitution strategy to tune the lattice oxygen redox of spinel oxides and bypass the AEM scaling relationship limitation. Taking NiCo2O4 as a model, the incorporation of Ce into the octahedral site induces the formation of Ce-O-M (M: Ni, Co) bridge, which triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4. The developed Ce-NiCo2O4 exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential, satisfactory electrochemical stability, and good practicability in anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical analyses reveal that OER on Ce-NiCo2O4 surface follows a more favorable lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) pathway and non-concerted proton-electron transfers compared to pure NiCo2O4, as further verified by pH-dependent behavior and in situ Raman analysis.&#160;18O-labeled electrochemical mass spectrometry directly demonstrates that oxygen originates from the lattice oxygen of Ce-NiCo2O4 during OER. It is discovered that electron delocalization of Ce 4f states triggers charge redistribution in NiCo2O4 through the Ce-O-M bridge, favoring antibonding state occupation of Ni-O bonding in [Ce-O-Ni] site, thereby activating lattice oxygen redox of NiCo2O4 in OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8216;Invisible&#8217; Molecular Dynamics Revealed for a Conformationally Chiral &#960;&#8208;Stacked Perylene Bisimide Foldamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst energetic and kinetic aspects of folding processes are meanwhile well understood for natural biomacromolecules, the folding dynamics in so far studied artificial foldamer counterparts remain largely unexplored. This is due to the low energy barriers between their conformational isomers that make the dynamic processes undetectable with conventional methods such as UV/vis absorption, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy, making such processes &#8216;invisible&#8217;. Here we present an asymmetric perylene bisimide dimer (bis&#8208;PBI 1) that possesses conformational chirality in its folded state. Owing to the large interconversion barrier (&#8805; 116 kJ mol&#8211;1), four stereoisomers could be separated and isolated. Since the interconversion between these stereoisomers requires the foldamer to first open and then to re&#8208;fold, the transformation of one stereoisomer into others allowed us to &#8216;visualize&#8217; the dynamics of folding with time and determine its lifetimes and the energetic barriers associated with the folding process. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, we identified the open structure to be only a fleeting metastable state of higher energy. Our experimental observation of the kinetics associated with the molecular dynamics in the PBI foldamer advances the fundamental understanding of folding in synthetic foldamers and paves the way for the design of smart functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Conditions for Intramolecular N&#8211;O Couplings via Rhodium Nitrenoids Generated from N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides, mechanochemically generated rhodium nitrenoids undergo intramolecular N&#8211;O couplings to provide unprecedented 1,3,2,4&#8208;oxathiadiazole 3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The cyclization proceeds efficiently with a catalyst loading of only 0.5 mol% in the presence of phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) as oxidant. Neither an inert atmosphere nor additional heating is required in this solvent&#8208;free procedure. Under heat or blue light, the newly formed five&#8208;membered heterocycles function as nitrene precursors reacting with sulfoxides as exemplified by the imidation of dimethyl sulfoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxytocin Analogues for the Oral Treatment of Abdominal Pain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abdominal pain presents an onerous reality for millions of people affected by gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The oxytocin receptor (OTR) has emerged as a new analgesic drug target with OTR expression upregulated on colon&#8208;innervating nociceptors in chronic visceral hypersensitivity states, accessible via luminal delivery. However, the low gastrointestinal stability of OTR&#8217;s endogenous peptide ligand oxytocin (OT) is a bottleneck for therapeutic development. Here, we report the development of potent and fully gut&#8208;stable OT analogues, laying the foundation for a new area of oral gut&#8208;specific peptide therapeutics. Ligand optimisation guided by structure&#8208;gut&#8208;stability&#8208;activity relationships yielded highly stable analogues (t1/2 &gt;24 h, compared to t1/2 &lt;10 min of OT in intestinal fluid) equipotent to OT (~3&#160;nM) and with enhanced OTR selectivity. Intra&#8208;colonic administration of the lead ligand significantly reduced colonic mechanical hypersensitivity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner in a mouse model of chronic abdominal pain. Moreover, oral administration of the lead ligand also displayed significant analgesia in this abdominal pain mouse model. The generated ligands and employed strategies could pave the way to a new class of oral gut&#8208;specific peptides to study and combat chronic gastrointestinal disorders, an area with substantial unmet medical needs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIB) have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of electrochemical energy storage. Despite its potential advantages in terms of safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and inherent safety, AZIB faces significant challenges. Issues attributed to unsupported thermodynamics and non&#8208;uniform potential distribution and deposition, present formidable obstacles that necessitate resolution. To tackle these challenges, a novel strategy adapting hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic in&#8208;situ derived solid&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel electrolyte interface (StHEI) has been developed from coordination reactions and self&#8208;respiratory process, establishing uniform diffusion channels by ion bridges and accelerating ion transport. Self&#8208;respiratory pattern of StHEI realized through in&#8208;situ inorganic component conversion further prolongs the protecting duration, which effectively mitigates corrosion and passivation but enhance the mechanical properties of the StHEI measured through Young&#8217;s modulus. This novel StHEI promotes well&#8208;distributed potential lines within the Helmholtz regions. Zn2+ are finally induced to deposit and nucleate in a compact, fine, and uniform manner. Asymmetrical batteries assembled with the modified Zn electrode and bare Zn exhibit exceptional stability over 3000 h (1 mA cm&#8208;2&#8208; 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2). The asymmetrical Cu//Zn cell achieved an outstanding average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% over 1200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of redox&#8208;active bipyridinium ligands into spin crossover active metal organic frameworks leads to void spaces reminiscent of the &#8216;little blue box&#8217;. The inclusion of a &#960;&#8208;electron rich aromatic guest molecule causes a single crystal to single crystal transformation and guest&#8208;induced spin transition. Therefore, this work inspires the spin state control of these systems through the application of (photo&#8208;)electrical stimuli.







Abstract
Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150&#8197;K and an approximate 23&#8201;% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.

Biprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnX4 and monoprotonated (R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnX4 (X=Cl, Br) were constructed from a single chiral organic cation. The reversible structural transformation induced by polar solvents and HBr/heat engenders chiroptical switching behaviors. The structural design strategy developed in this work elucidates the structure&#8208;property mechanism underlying the structural transitions and the distortion&#8208;related chirality transfer.







Abstract
Precise control over the organic composition is crucial for tailoring the distinctive structures and properties of hybrid metal halides. However, this approach is seldom utilized to develop materials that exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of enantiomeric hybrid zinc bromides: biprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H16N2)ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH2)ZnBr4) and monoprotonated ((R/S)&#8208;C12H15N2)2ZnBr4 ((R/S&#8208;LH1)2ZnBr4), derived from the chiral organic amine (R/S)&#8208;2,3,4,9&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine ((R/S)&#8208;C12H14N2). These compounds showcase luminescent properties; the zero&#8208;dimensional biprotonated form emits green light at 505&#8197;nm, while the monoprotonated form, with a pseudo&#8208;layered structure, displays red luminescence at 599 and 649&#8197;nm. Remarkably, the reversible local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior of the organic cations allows for exposure to polar solvents and heating to induce reversible structural and luminescent transformations between the two forms. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower energy barrier associated with the deprotonation process within the pyrrole ring is responsible for the local protonation&#8208;deprotonation behavior observed. These enantiomorphic hybrid zinc bromides also exhibit switchable circular dichroism (CD) and CPL properties. Furthermore, their chloride counterparts were successfully obtained by adjusting the halogen ions. Importantly, the unique stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL characteristics position these hybrid zinc halides as promising candidates for applications in information storage, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Controlled Release of Diborane from Alkali Metal Borohydride using Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom efficient method of producing diborane from borohydride sources has been provided. Ionic liquids provide a controlled source of boron trifluoride which acts as a Lewis acid to release diborane. The EMIM generated from the ionic liquid also burns effectively in air making a highly efficient fuel source which combusts in air.







Abstract
Alkali metal borohydrides present a rich source of energy dense materials of boron and hydrogen, however their potential in propellants has been hitherto untapped. Potassium borohydride is a promising fuel with high gravimetric energy density and relatively low sensitivity to air and moisture. Problems arise due to the dehydrogenation of the borohydride on heating with minimal energy release. Common methods to extract both boron and hydrogen by means of borane species involve direct reaction of boron trifluoride species with alkali borohydrides. However, these methods face storage and safety issues due to rapid release of diborane on mixing the reactants. We propose a method of diborane release through controlled release of boron trifluoride by means of a tetrafluoroborate based ionic liquid. The trifluoride is released from the ionic liquid at elevated temperatures and enables safe mixture of the reactants at room temperature. It was found that the reaction between borohydride and boron trifluoride proceeds well above room temperature with potassium borohydride releasing diborane and potassium fluoride. The reaction pathway shows a primary reaction releasing diborane and potassium fluoride and a second less energy efficient step leading to the formation of potassium tetrafluoroborate. A 3D printed propellant formulation was also tested.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2 Catalysts in Li&#8722;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion P and cation Mo co&#8208;doped MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) electrocatalyst was designed for durable Li&#8722;S batteries. Such P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 electrocatalyst combine strong anchoring for polysulfides with the uniquely selective bi&#8208;directional electrocatalytic activity for nucleation and dissociation of Li2S, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and achieving simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce the cyclability of Li&#8722;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2 (P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO2. Furthermore, this well&#8208;designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P&#8208;doping expedites rapid Li2S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction&#8208;free energy, while Mo&#8208;doping facilitates robust Li2S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers. This dual&#8208;doping approach equips P,Mo&#8208;MnO2 with robust bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8722;S batteries incorporating P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based separators demonstrate favorable performance than pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi&#8208;directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Radical Isomerization Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Access C5, C6 or C7 Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical isomerization homopolymerization of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins has been successfully developed. Utilizing various monomers, the radical translocation pathway involving cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer occurs with remarkable efficiency and selectivity. These distinct propagation mechanisms enable C5, C6, or C7 polymerizations with precise control over monomer composition and main chain sequence.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated linear &#945;&#8208;olefins are valuable building blocks for organic transformation or olefin (co)polymerization, but they are recognized as textbook knowledge for non&#8208;homopolymerizable monomers under radical conditions. In this article, we disclose our effort to achieve an unprecedented library of all carbon&#8208;bonded sequence&#8208;regulated polymers via radical isomerization homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;olefin derivatives. The success of this distinctive polymerization is attributed to the remarkable efficiency and selectivity exhibited during the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer, which is greatly enhanced by the precise engineering of their monomer structures. This polymerization process enables the elongation of polymer chains by five, six, or seven carbon atoms at each propagation step. These polymers, obtained through the cyano group migration or hydrogen atom transfer involved radical isomerization polymerization processes, emerge as promising candidates resembling polyethylene or polyacrylonitrile copolymers.

         <title>Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One&#8208;Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C2H2 binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2 mixture.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C2H6 and C2H2. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture because of the low C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C2H6 and C2H2 preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF&#8208;TDCPB can not only obtain high&#8208;purity C2H4 from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixture, with the C2H4 productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF&#8208;TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high&#8208;humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C2H2, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.

     alt="Synergistic C2H2 Binding Sites in Hydrogen-Bonded Supramolecular Framework for One-Step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2 Mixture"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hydrogen-bonded organic framework possesses synergistic C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding sites on its pore surface, firstly realizing one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from ternary C2 mixture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purification of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the ternary C2 hydrocarbon mixture in one step is of critical significance but still extremely challenging according to its intermediate physical properties between C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) stabilized by supramolecular interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. However, it remains a problem to efficiently realize the one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture because of the low C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. We herein report a robust microporous HOF (termed as HOF-TDCPB) with dense O atoms and aromatic rings distributed on the pore surface which provide C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; preferred environment simultaneously. Dynamic breakthrough experiments indicate that HOF-TDCPB can not only obtain high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from binary C2 mixture, but also firstly realize one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture, with the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; productivity of 3.2&#8197;L/kg (&amp;gt;99.999&#8201;%) for one breakthrough cycle. Furthermore, HOF-TDCPB displays outstanding stability in air, organic solvents and water, which endow it excellent cycle performance even under high-humidity conditions. Theoretical calculations indicate that multiple O sites on pore channels can create synergistic binding sites for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus affording overall stronger multipoint interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Computation&#8208;Guided Design of Highly Defined and Dense Bimetallic Active Sites on a Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper designs a substrate&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional conducting metal&#8211;organic framework with high density of active sites (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)) as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. This strategy provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites. Moreover, thermodynamics and kinetics are combined to explain the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental conclusions, which provides a referable direction for further computationally guided experiments.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of CoN4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90&#8201;%/85&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8211;0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative B&#8592;N bonds simultaneously integrate solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect and visible light reactivity into a crystalline supramolecular host. Alkenes organized by B&#8592;N bonds enable rapid guest release within the host upon visible light exposure in air through [2+2] photocycloaddition. Benefiting from the reversible structural transformation between B&#8592;N host and adduct cocrystal, a customized capture and release of guests is realized.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447&#8197;nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Cu&#8208;Doped NiCo Alloy Supported on Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu doped NiCo alloy supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) is synthesized. Because Cu doping facilitates the coupling of reaction intermediates with surface adsorbed oxygen, the catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and formate Faraday efficiency. Besides, a coupled system of glycerol oxidation with nitrate reduction is constructed, which further enhances the activity, reduces energy consumption and gains valuable ammonia simultaneously.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol which is regarded as a main byproduct of industrial biodiesel production, is an innovative strategy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals, but currently showcases slow kinetics, limited Faraday efficiency, and unclear catalytic mechanism. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency electrooxidation of glycerol into formate via a Cu doped NiCo alloy catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF) in a coupled system paired with nitrate reduction. The designed Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF delivers only 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record Faraday efficiency of formate of 93.8&#8201;%. The superior performance is ascribed to the rapid generation of NiIII&#8722;OOH and CoIII&#8722;OOH species and favorable coupling of surface *O with reactive intermediates. Using Cu&#8722;NiCo/NF as a bifunctional catalyst, the coupled system synchronously produces NH3 and formate, showing 290&#8197;mV lower than the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction, together with excellent long&#8208;term stability for up to 144&#8197;h. This work lays out new guidelines and reliable strategies from catalyst design to system coupling for biomass&#8208;derived electrochemical refinery.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral homopropargylic alcohols affords cyclopentenes with a quaternary chiral center. A chiral binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl phosphine ligand featuring a distal phosphoryl group enables gold&#8208;ligand cooperation in this highly enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cyclization chemistry.







Abstract
Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety&#8212;an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the substrate HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of enoate and ketone precursors. In addition to monocyclic cyclopentenes, spirocyclic and bicyclic ones are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient method for the C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines was developed using readily available sulfinates and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This photoinduced radical approach enables the difunctionalization of alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane, providing access to a wide variety of fluoroalkylated pyridines.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, challenges are often faced with conventional Minisci reactions in achieving precise regioselectivity owing to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC ligand&#8208;accelerated catalysis of zinc cyclopropoxide enables a stereoselective hydroxyallylation of cyclopropenes with enolized homoenolate as a transient prochiral nucleophile, thus affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. An enantioselective variant has also been achieved using a chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC.







Abstract
A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;focus computationally guided iterative mutagenesis workflow was developed to simultaneously improve stability and activity in methyl parathion hydrolase. Thus, this study details a strategic innovation to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in protein engineering and can guide future efforts to design stable, highly active enzymes with defined structure&#8208;function relationships.







Abstract
Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme, methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23&#8197;candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm and 4.2&#8197;times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

&lt;p&gt;A new bilayer-forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath &lt;i&gt;et&#8197;al&lt;/i&gt;., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water-exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life-like materials and artificial cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath &lt;i&gt;et&#8197;al&lt;/i&gt;. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;-conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine-terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time-resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life-like materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored molecular trap with optimal oxygen sites distribution is fabricated for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene isomers. Based on the specific molecular length recognition, simultaneous ultra&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) are achieved in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption.







Abstract
Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8211;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8722;C4H2O&#8722;CO2], featuring an effective pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.

         <title>Does H2 Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction Always Probe Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry? The Case of Pt/CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox reactions on the surface of transition metal oxides are of broad interest in thermo, photo, and electrocatalysis. H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction (H2&#8208;TPR) is commonly used to probe oxide reducibility by measuring the rate of H2 consumption during temperature ramps, assuming that this rate is controlled by oxide reduction. However, oxide reduction involves several elementary steps, such as H2 dissociation and H&#8208;spillover, before surface reduction and H2O formation occur. In this study, we evaluated the kinetics of H2 consumption over CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 with varying Pt loadings and structures to identify the elementary steps probed by H2&#8208;TPR. Literature often attributes changes in H2&#8208;TPR characteristics with Pt addition to increased CeO2 reducibility. However, our analysis revealed that the H2 consumption rate is measurement of the rate of H&#8208;spillover at Pt&#8208;CeO2 interfaces and is determined by the concentration of Pt species on Pt nanoclusters that dissociate H2. Therefore, lower temperature H2 consumption observed with Pt addition does not indicate higher CeO2 reducibility. Measurements on samples with mixtures of Pt single&#8208;atoms and nanoclusters demonstrated that H2&#8208;TPR can effectively quantify dilute Pt nanocluster concentrations, suggesting caution in directly linking H2&#8208;TPR characteristics to oxide reducibility while highlighting alternative material insights that can be gleaned.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane as Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high dissymmetry factors (gEL) and color purity through the employment of novel chiral source, topologically chiral [2]catenanes were first utilized as the key chiral skeleton to construct novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Impressively, the efficient chirality induction and unique switchable feature of topologically chiral [2]catenane not only lead to a high |gPL| value up to 1.6 &#215; 10&#8208;2 but also facilitate in situ dynamic switching of the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the resultant topologically chiral emitters exhibit reveal narrow FWHM of 36 nm, maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.6%, and CPEL with |gEL| of 2.1 &#215; 10&#8208;3. This study demonstrates the successful construction of the first CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters based on topological chirality with the highest |gPL| among the reported CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters and excellent device performance to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, it endowed the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with distinctive switchable CPL performances, thus providing a novel design strategy as well as a promising platform for developing intelligent CP&#8208;OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Stimulus Response Study on the Acetylene/Ethylene Purification Process in MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient removal of acetylene (C2H2) impurities from polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) in a simple, clean manner remains a challenging goal in industry.   The use of porous materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is promising for this aim but the acquisition of high purification performance is still hindered by few knowledge on the purification process because the previous conclusions were derived basically from the non&#8208;breakthrough tests or ignored the influence of structural difference (crystal structure, morphology, or defect). Here we propose an unprecedented in situ stimulus response strategy to minimize the influence of structural difference, obtain the gas&#8208;loading crystal structures of the same MOF before and after light or heat stimulation, directly observe the evolution of pore charge distribution and pore&#215;&#215;&#215;gas interactions under light/heat induction, and finally summarizes the favorable structure for highly efficient purification of C2H4. This study opens a new route to understand the relationship between the structure and separation performance for porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing a Robust Nonlinear Targeted Switch for C1 Electroproduction in Atomic Alloy Cox/Pd Bimetallenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing a targeted switch for CO2 conversion under electric drive is essential for achieving carbon&#8208;balance by enabling selective chemicals. However, engineering the topological assembly of active sites to precisely regulate the competing pathways for various intermediates has been plagued by unclear structure&#8208;function relationships. To tailor the CO/formate pathways, herein we established a robust nonlinear targeted switch with tunable active Cox sites integrated into Pd metallene, which involves Co1/Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (favoring CO) and Co2/Pd diatomic alloy (favoring formate). Transitioning from Co1/Pd to Co2/Pd atomic alloy bimetallenes resulted in a nonlinear, high&#8208;contrast flip in selectivity, surpassing 94% for CO and formate productions in both H&#8208;cell and flow cell. Furthermore, the superior selectivity and current efficiency for CO (&gt; 80 %) and formate (&gt; 88%) were consistently maintained at &#8208;150 mA cm&#8208;2 over continuous 200 h. Theoretical simulations and in&#8208;situ spectroscopy analyses unveiled that appropriate adjacent metal site combinations (Pd&#8208;Pd, Pd&#8208;Co and Co&#8208;Co) lead to tunable dz2 band center and a nonlinear shift in preferred adsorption configurations of intermediates, dictating the C1 pathways. Our finding reveals a desired switch in C1 selectivity and robust stability within Cox/Pd system, providing a new perspective for fine&#8208;tuning energy conversion processes through specific topological assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;sensitivity in functional synthetic polymer properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a new class of synthetic methyl methacrylate&#8208;based random heteropolymers (MMA&#8208;based RHPs) has displayed protein&#8208;like properties. Their function appears to be insensitive to the precise sequence. Here, through atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we show that there are universal protein&#8208;like features of MMA&#8208;based RHPs that are insensitive to the sequence, and mostly depend on the overall composition. In particular, we find that MMA&#8208;based RHPs ``fold'' into globules with heterogeneous hydration patterns. However, the insensitivity to sequence identity observed in MMA&#8208;based RHPs dramatically changes when we substitute the backbone architecture with acrylate or replace the oxygen atom in the side chain with a nitrogen atom (methacrylamide or acrylamide). Using principal component analysis and an intersection&#8208;over&#8208;union based index, we demonstrate that different sequences may not overlap in the property space, meaning that their properties are controlled by the sequence rather than fixed composition. We further investigate the sequence&#8208;insensitive capability of the MMA&#8208;based RHPs as previously reported on bacterial phospholipase OmpLA stabilization through heterodimerization. As experimentally observed, such polymers enhance the stability of OmpLA as reliably as its native bilayer environment. The design of such MMA&#8208;based RHPs provides a sequence&#8208;insensitive alternative to protein&#8208;mimetic biomaterials that is orthogonal to the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function paradigm of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing energy migration via antiparallel spin alignment in one&#8208;dimensional Mn2+ halide magnets with high luminescence efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcited energy migration is prone to causing luminescence quenching in Mn2+ luminescent materials, presenting a formidable challenge for optoelectronic applications. Although various strategies and mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the role of spin alignment between adjacent Mn2+ ions has remained largely unexamined. In this study, we have elucidated the influence of spin alignment on energy migration within the one&#8208;dimensional Mn2+&#8208;metal halide compound (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) through variable&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic&#8208;optical spectroscopy. This investigation was conducted with reference to (CH6N3)2MnCl4 (GUA) with isolated [Mn3Cl12]6&#8208; trimers and Cd2+&#8208;doped TMMC. The spin order in TMMC below approximately 55 K is demonstrated by the disorder&#8208;order transition observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility. This finding is further corroborated by the negligible shift in the temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent emission peaks, a consequence of magnetic saturation. Our results indicate that the antiparallel spin alignment along the Mn2+ chain in TMMC effectively suppresses energy migration and multiphonon relaxation, thereby reducing nonradiative transitions and enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).This research casts new light on the potential for developing high&#8208;performance Mn2+&#8208;doped phosphors for optoelectronic and spin&#8208;photonic applications, offering insights into the manipulation of spin and energy dynamics in these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Asymmetric Zn&#8211;N3 Bridge between 2D Photocatalyst and Co&#8208;catalyst for Directed Charge Transfer toward Efficient H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymeric semiconductors are a class of promising photocatalysts; however, it remains challenging to facilitate their interlayer charge transfer for suppressed in&#8208;plane charge recombination and thus improved quantum efficiency. Although some strategies, such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and van der Waals interaction, have been developed so far, directed interlayer charge transfer still cannot be achieved. Herein, we report a strategy of forming asymmetric Zn&#8211;N3 units that can bridge nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon layers with polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4&#8208;Zn&#8208;N(C)) to address this challenge. The symmetry&#8208;breaking Zn&#8211;N3 moiety, which has an asymmetric local charge distribution, enables directed interfacial charge transfer between the C3N4 photocatalyst and the N&#8208;doped carbon co&#8208;catalyst. As evidenced by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, charge separation can be significantly enhanced by the interfacial asymmetric Zn&#8211;N3 bonding bridges. As a result, the designed C3N4&#8208;Zn&#8208;N(C) catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 photosynthesis activity, outperforming most of the reported C3N4&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of tailoring interfacial chemical bonding channels in polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to achieve effective spatial charge separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining Absolute Configuration of Small Molecules by Diffusion NMR Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomers are ubiquitous in many areas of science, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) alone is not able to differentiate enantiomers as their spectra are identical. However, these can be distinguished using chiral auxiliaries (such as chiral complexing agents) that form diastereomeric complexes, but absolute identification is still troublesome, usually requiring a chemical reaction with a chiral derivatizing agent. Here, we propose a new method that uses a hybrid mixture of solvating agents in a simple comparison of diffusion NMR experiments, which can discriminate enantiomers in both frequency and diffusion domains, dubbed CHIMERA (CHIral Micelle Enantiomer Resolving Agent). The new method was assessed for twenty&#8208;three small chiral molecules using a combination of BINOL and (&#8208;)&#8208;DMEB, a chiral surfactant, and initial results indicate that absolute configuration can be obtained from a simple experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Gated Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry in Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) during the activation of small molecules has inspired extensive research across the full span of chemical science. Owing to the nature of weak interactions, it is experimentally challenging to directly observe and modulate FLP at the molecular scale. Here we design a boron cluster anion building block (B10H82&#8208;) and organic amine cations ([NR4]+, R= &#8208;CH3, &#8208;C2H5) as the FLP to prove the feasibility of controlling their interaction in the electric double layer (EDL) via an electrochemical strategy. In situ single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements and Raman monitoring of B10H82&#8208;&#8211;[NR4]+ FLP formed at the positively charged Au(111) electrode surface, in contrast to the free&#8208;standing B10H82&#8208; near or below the potential of zero charge (PZC). Furthermore, this FLP chemistry leads to a shift in the local density of states of boron clusters towards the EF for enhancing electron transport, providing a new prototype of a reversible single&#8208;cluster switch that digitally switches upon controlling FLP chemistry in the electric double layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated mechanochemical synthesis of covalent organic frameworks: cocrystal precursor strategy for confined assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional imine covalent organic frameworks (2D imine&#8208;COFs) are crystalline porous materials with broad application prospects. Despite the efforts&#160;into their design and synthesis, the mechanisms of their formation are still not fully understood. Herein, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step mechanochemical cocrystal precursor synthetic strategy is developed for efficient construction of 2D imine&#8208;COFs. The mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the cocrystal precursors of 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT) and p&#8208;toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) sufficiently regulate the crystalline structure of COF. Evidenced by characterizations and theoretical studies, a helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network was constructed by the N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O supramolecular synthons between amine and sulfate in TAPT&#8208;PTSA, demonstrating the role of cocrystals in promoting the organized stacking of interlayer &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, layer arrangement, and interlayer spacing, thus facilitating the orderly assembly of COFs. Moreover, the protonation degree of TAPT amines, which tuned nucleophilic directionality, enabled the sequential progression of intra&#8208; and interlayer imine condensation reactions, inhibiting the formation of amorphous polymers. The transformation from cocrystal precursors to COFs was achieved through comprehensive control of hydrogen bond and covalent bond sites. This work significantly advances the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated COF assembly and its mechanochemical method in the design and synthesis of 2D imine&#8208;COFs, further elucidating the mechanistic aspects of their mechanochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Matching high&#8208;voltage cathodes with lithium metal anodes represents the most viable technological approach for developing secondary batteries with ultra&#8208;high energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8208;1. Nevertheless, the instability of electrolyte/electrode interface film and commercial electrolytes with cut&#8208;off voltage above 4.3 V is still a major concern. Herein, we present that excellent cycling stability with an ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 5.0 V can be obtained by using three&#8208;component additives containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), and tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB). Excellent ionic conductivity, robust interfacial films on both electrodes, and long&#8208;lasting uniform Li+ regulation ability can be obtained in the modifying electrolyte. Consequently, using a high plating/stripping capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8208;2 under the current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2, lithium symmetric cells demonstrate stable cycling performance exceeding 800 hours. Meanwhile, the 7.3 Ah&#8208;class Li[NixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;y]O2 (x=0.83, NCM83)| Li pouch cells are assembled, which show a high energy density of 522 Wh kg&#8208;1 and present excellent stability over 178 cycles with a high initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.0%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure and Dissociation of Interfacial Water on RuO2 for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the structure and dynamic process of interfacial water molecules at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is highly desirable for the development of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Herein, we construct a series of p&#8208;block metallic elements (Ga, In, Sn) doped RuO2 catalysts with manipulated electronic structure and Ru&#8208;O covalency to investigate the effect of electrochemical interfacial engineering on the improvement of acidic OER activity. Associated with operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical analysis, we uncover the free&#8208;H2O enriched local environment and dynamic evolution from 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water to free&#8208;H2O on the surface of Ga&#8208;RuO2, are responsible for the optimized connectivity of hydrogen bonding network in the electrical double layer by promoting solvent reorganization. In addition, the structurally ordered interfacial water molecules facilitate high&#8208;efficiency proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer across the interface, leading to reduced energy barrier of the follow&#8208;up dissociation process and enhanced acidic OER performance. This work highlights the key role of structure and dynamic process of interfacial water for acidic OER, and demonstrates the electrochemical interfacial engineering as an efficient strategy to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Separation of Integratively Self&#8208;Sorted Pd2LA2LB2 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integrative implementation of multiple different components into metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assemblies requires sophisticated strategies to avoid the formation of statistical mixtures. Previously, the key focus was set on thermodynamically driven reactions of simple homoleptic into complex heteroleptic structures. Using Pd2LA2LB2&#8208;type coordination cages, we herein show that integrative self&#8208;sorting can be reversed by a change of solvent (from DMSO to MeCN) to favor narcissistic re&#8208;segregation into coexisting homoleptic species Pd2LA4&#160;and Pd3LB6. Full separation (&#8220;unsorting&#8221;) back to a mixture of the homoleptic precursors was finally achieved by selective precipitation of Pd3LB6with anionic guest&#160;G1&#160;from MeCN, keeping pure Pd2LA4&#160;in solution. When a mixture of homoleptic Pd3LB6&#160;and heteroleptic Pd2LA2LB2&#160;is exposed to a combination of two different di&#8208;anions (G1&#160;and&#160;G2) in DMSO, selective guest uptake gives rise to two defined coexisting host&#8208;guest complexes.&#160;A joint experimental and deep theoretical investigation via liquid&#8208;state integral equation theory of the reaction thermodynamics on a molecular level accompanied by solvent distribution analysis hints at solvent expulsion from Pd2LA4&#160;to favor the formation of Pd2LA2LB2&#160;in DMSO as the key entropic factor for determining the solvent&#8208;specific modulation of the cage conversion equilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Dispersed ZnO Sites in a ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst Promote Carbon Dioxide&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts have shown better activity in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol compared with single component counterparts, but the interaction between ZnO and ZrO2 is still poorly understood. In particular, the effect of the ZrO2 support phase (tetragonal vs. monoclinic) was not systematically explored. Here, we have synthesized ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;t) and monoclinic ZrO2 (ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;m), which resulted in the formation of different ZnOx species, consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer ZnO moieties and large&#8208;sized ZnO particles, respectively. ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;t exhibited a higher methanol selectivity (81 vs. 39%) and methanol yield (1.25 vs. 0.67 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) compared with ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;m. The difference in performance was attributed to the redox state and degree of dispersion of Zn, based on spectroscopy and microscopy results. ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;t had a high density of ZnOx&#8208;ZrOy sites, which favored the formation of active HCOO* species and enhanced the yield and selectivity of methanol along the formate pathway. Such ZnO clusters were further dispersed on ZrO2&#8208;t during catalysis, while larger ZnO particles on ZnO/ZrO2&#8208;m remained stable throughout the reaction.&#160;This study shows that the phase of ZrO2 supports can be used to control the dispersion of ZnO and the catalyst surface chemistry, and lead to enhanced catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Weaving towards Flexible Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Efficient Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit considerable potential in gas separations owing to their remarkable stability and tunable pore structures. Nevertheless, their application as gas separation membranes is hindered by limited size&#8208;sieving capabilities and poor processability. In this study, we propose a novel molecular weaving strategy that combines hydroxyl polymers and 2D TpPa&#8208;SO3H&#160;COF nanosheets, achieving high gas separation efficiency. Driven by the strong electrostatic interactions, the hydroxyl chains thread through the COF pores, effectively weaving and assembling the composites to achieve exceptional flexibility and high mechanical strength.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit considerable potential in gas separations owing to their remarkable stability and tunable pore structures. Nevertheless, their application as gas separation membranes is hindered by limited size-sieving capabilities and poor processability. In this study, we propose a novel molecular weaving strategy that combines hydroxyl polymers and 2D TpPa-SO3H&#160;COF nanosheets, achieving high gas separation efficiency. Driven by the strong electrostatic interactions, the hydroxyl chains thread through the COF pores, effectively weaving and assembling the composites to achieve exceptional flexibility and high mechanical strength. The penetrated chains also reduce the effective pore size of COFs, and combined with the &#8220;secondary confinement effect&#8221; stemming from abundant CO2&#160;sorption sites in the channels, the PVA@TpPa-SO3H membrane demonstrates a remarkable H2&#160;permeance of 1267.3 GPU and an H2/CO2&#160;selectivity of 43, surpassing the 2008 Robson upper bound limit. This facile strategy holds promise for the manufacture of large-area COF-based membranes for small-sized gas separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipyridines represent a class of ligands renowned for their versatility and efficacy in numerous transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Chiral bipyridine ligands are noted for their distinctive reactivity and stereoselectivity. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a class of bipyridine ligands endowed with an axially chiral scaffold. These ligands feature: (a) a precisely aligned coplanar bipyridine framework that is beneficial for metal chelation; (b) a spacious environment around the metal&#8208;bipyridine complexes, capable of hosting substrates with substantial steric bulk; (c) a chiral pocket induced by the axially chiral architecture. These atropochiral planar bipyridine ligands were successfully applied in copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening reactions of cyclic diaryliodoniums with bulky secondary amines, achieving high efficiency and stereoselectivity that were unsuccessful in our previous efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Reconstruction of Self&#8208;Assembling Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural photosynthetic systems require spatiotemporal organization to optimize photosensitized reactions and maintain overall efficiency, involving the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of photosynthetic components and their stabilization through synergistic interactions. However, replicating this level of organization is challenging due to the difficulty in efficiently communicating supramolecular nano&#8208;assemblies with nanoparticles or biological architectures, owing to their dynamic instability. Herein, we demonstrate that the supramolecular reconstruction of self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic rhodamine B nanospheres (RN) through treatment with metal&#8208;phenolic coordination complexes results in the formation of a stable hybrid structure. This reconstructed structure enhances electron transfer efficiency, leading to improved photocatalytic performance. Due to the photoluminescence quenching property of RN and its electronic synergy with tannic acid (T) and zirconium (Z), the supramolecular complexes of hybrid nanospheres (RNTxZy) with Pt nanoparticles or a biological workhorse, Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, showed marked improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The supramolecular hybrid particles with a metal&#8208;phenolic coordination layer showed 5.6&#8208; and 4.0&#8208;fold increases, respectively, in the productivities of hydrogen evolution catalyzed by Pt (Pt/RNTxZy) and MR&#8208;1 (M/RNTxZy), respectively. These results highlight the potential for further advancements in the structural and photochemical control of supramolecular nanomaterials for energy harvesting and bio&#8208;hybrid systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Affecting Charges and Structures of {Bi6} Architectures by 12&#8208;Electron Transition Metal Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules based on polyatomic bismuth substructures are currently attracting a lot of attention owing to this heavy and essentially non&#8208;toxic element&#8217;s uncommon chemical and physical properties, which include unprecedented bonding properties. Hexaatomic {Bi6} substructures that underly more complex cluster structures were recently reported to adopt different structures or exhibit different structural details as a consequence of the charge of the {Bi6} unit. This leads to either crown&#8208;shaped cycles for a nominal Bi66&#8722; or differently distorted trigonal prisms for compositions close to Bi62&#8722;. It was predicted by quantum chemistry that Bi64&#8722; should adopt a distinctly distorted boat&#8208;like shape, yet a corresponding compound has remained elusive. Here, we report a proof of this assumption by the synthesis and isolation of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]2[Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]&#8729;1.5THF (1), comprising a bimetallic [Bi6{Zn(hmds)}2]2&#8722; cluster that fulfils the prediction for the geometric and electronic structure of the missing link (crypt&#8208;222 = 4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[8.8.8]hexa&#8208;cosane, hmds = hexamethyldisilazanid). A detailed quantum chemical study shows how the nature of Lewis&#8208;acidic transition metal complexes &#8211; in particular, 12&#8208;electron fragments &#8211; control and fine&#8208;tune the resulting {Bi6} architectures in accordance with the degree of electron&#8208;withdrawal from the polybismuthide core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photocrosslinking Probe to Capture the Substrates of Caseinolytic Protease P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy using trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) and capture substrates within the barrel via a photocrosslinking moiety upon UV irradiation. The probes retain protease activity and capture numerous known and novel substrates of ClpP, allowing the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.







Abstract
Protein homeostasis in bacteria is regulated by proteases such as the tetradecameric caseinolytic protease P (ClpP). Although substrates of ClpP have been successfully deciphered in genetically engineered cells, methods which directly trap processed proteins within native cells remain elusive. Here, we introduce an in situ trapping strategy which utilizes trifunctional probes that bind to the active site serine of ClpP and capture adjacent substrates with an attached photocrosslinking moiety. After enrichment using an alkyne handle, substrate deconvolution by mass spectrometry (MS) is performed. We show that our two traps bind substoichiometrically to ClpP, retain protease activity, exhibit unprecedented selectivity for Staphylococcus aureus ClpP in living cells and capture numerous known and novel substrates. The exemplary validation of trapped hits using a targeted proteomics approach confirmed the fidelity of this technology. In conclusion, we provide a novel chemical platform suited for the discovery of serine protease substrates beyond genetic engineering.

         <title>Reconfiguring the Hydrogen Networks of Aqueous Electrolyte to Stabilize Iron Hexacyanoferrate for High&#8208;Voltage pH&#8208;Decoupled Cell</title>

Proton insertion&#8208;induced local pH increase leads to PBA dissolution. Our strategy locks water molecules to disrupt the proton diffusion's hydrogen bond network, inhibit the proton insertion, and stabilize electrode pH, consequently ensuring stable PBA cathode cycling.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising insertion&#8208;type cathode materials for different types of aqueous batteries, capable of accommodating metal or non&#8208;metal ions. However, their practical application is hindered by their susceptibility to dissolution, which leads to a shortened lifespan. Herein, we have revealed that the dissolution of PBAs primarily originates from the locally elevated pH of electrolytes, which is caused by the proton co&#8208;insertion during discharge. To address this issue, the water&#8208;locking strategy has been implemented, which interrupts the generation and Grotthuss diffusion of protons by breaking the well&#8208;connected hydrogen bonding network in aqueous electrolytes. As a result, the hybrid electrolyte enables the iron hexacyanoferrate to endure over 1000&#8197;cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate and supports a high&#8208;voltage pH&#8208;decoupled cell with an average voltage of 1.95&#8197;V. These findings provide insights for mitigating the dissolution of electrode materials, thereby enhancing the viability and performance of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bltter&#8208;pyr radical/cobalt interface is investigated. We found that changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allows screening, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.







Abstract
In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces given their potential applications in spintronics.

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C</title>

Acetic acid, a key intermediate compound, is synthesized by oxidization of ethane with H2O2 at 0&#8201;&#176;C at ambient pressure through an integrated thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. The selectivity for producing acetic acid reaches 98.7&#8201;%. The positively charged Pd1 atom with an adsorbed OH group is the site for activating the first C&#8722;H of C2H6 with an energy barrier of only 0.14&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8722;Pd1

/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8722;H instead of C&#8722;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14&#8197;eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7&#8201;%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#8201;&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by MOF&#8208;Derived Metal Oxide Heterojunctions with a 10.0&#8201;% Apparent Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrolysis of Ti(IV)&#8208; and Ru(II/III)&#8208;based MOFs results in the formation of metal oxide heterojunctions, which exhibit photocatalytic activity for water reduction and hydrogen generation, achieving an apparent quantum yield of 10.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production offers an alternative pathway to establish a sustainable energy economy, utilizing the Earth's natural sunlight and water resources to address environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel combustion. While numerous photoactive materials exhibit high potential for generating hydrogen from water, the synergy achieved by combining two different materials with complementary properties in the form of heterojunctions can significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen production and quantum efficiency. Our study describes the design and generation of the metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived (MOF) metal oxide heterojunction herein referred to as RTTA, composed of RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2. The RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 is generated through the pyrolysis of MOFs, Ru&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1, and the amino&#8208;functionalized MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 in the presence of thiourea. Among the various RTTA materials tested, RTTA&#8208;1, characterized by the lowest RuO2 content, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate, producing 10,761&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 of hydrogen with an apparent quantum yield of 10.0&#8201;% in pure water containing glycerol. In addition to RTTA&#8208;1, we generated two other MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide heterojunctions, namely ZTTA&#8208;1 (ZnO/N,S&#8208;TiO2) and ITTA&#8208;1 (In2O3/N,S&#8208;TiO2). These heterojunctions were tested for their photocatalytic activity, leading to apparent quantum yields of 0.7&#8201;% and 0.3&#8201;%, respectively. The remarkable photocatalytic activity observed in RTTA&#8208;1 is thought to be attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the combination of metallic properties inherent in the metal oxides, complemented by the presence of suitable band alignment, porosity, and surface properties inherited from the parent MOFs. These properties enhance electron transfer and restrict hole movement. The photocatalytic efficiency of RTTA&#8208;1 was further demonstrated in actual water samples, producing hydrogen with a rate of 8,190&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 in tap water, and 6,390&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 in river water.

         <title>Strengthening an Intramolecular Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond to Get in Shape for Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) are not considered strong interactions, they can profoundly affect molecular interactions. One prominent example is the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx. When the CH3 group of l&#8208;fucose is replaced by CF3, the intramolecular non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond approaches the strength of a classical H&#8208;bond. Thus, although currently underestimated, non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds should find a place in the toolbox for structural design.







Abstract
In this research article, we report on the strengthening of a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) by introducing electron withdrawing groups at the carbon atom. The approach is demonstrated on the example of derivatives of the physiological E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx (1, sLex). Its affinity is mainly due to a beneficial entropy term, which is predominantly caused by the pre&#8208;organization of sLex in its binding conformation. We have shown, that among the elements responsible for the pre&#8208;organization, the stabilization by a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond between the H&#8722;C5 of l&#8208;fucose and the ring oxygen O5 of the neighboring d&#8208;galactose moiety is essential and yields 7.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This effect could be further strengthened by replacing l&#8208;fucose by 6,6,6&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;l&#8208;fucose leading to an improved non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond of 14.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, i.e., an improved pre&#8208;organization in the bioactive conformation. For a series of glycomimetics of sLex (1), this outcome could be confirmed by high field NMR&#8208;shifts of the H&#8722;C5Fuc, by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of glycomimetics co&#8208;crystallized with E&#8208;selectin as well as by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the CF3&#8208;group beneficially influences the pharmacokinetic properties of sLex mimetics. Thus, acid&#8208;stability, a prerequisite for gastrointestinal stability, could be substantially improved.

This effect could be further strengthened by replacing &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose by 6,6,6-trifluoro-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose leading to an improved non-classical H-bond of 14.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., an improved pre-organization in the bioactive conformation. For a series of glycomimetics of sLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), this outcome could be confirmed by high field NMR-shifts of the H&#8722;C5&lt;sup&gt;Fuc&lt;/sup&gt;, by X-ray diffraction analysis of glycomimetics co-crystallized with E-selectin as well as by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the electron-withdrawing character of the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group beneficially influences the pharmacokinetic properties of sLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; mimetics. Thus, acid-stability, a prerequisite for gastrointestinal stability, could be substantially improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonalternant B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Containing Azepines: Programmable Synthesis, Responsive Chiroptical Properties and Spontaneous Resolution into a Single&#8208;Handed Helix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a programmable and modular approach to fledged B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes was achieved by stepwise Scholl reactions with privileged formation of [9]helicene moiety. The controllable integration of negatively curved azepines into 6 afforded the dynamic chiral skeleton, which induced spontaneous resolution into single&#8208;handed helix at the single&#8208;crystal scale.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (NGs) constitute an important and appealing class of intrinsically chiral materials. In this work, a series of B,N&#8208;embedded helical NGs (BN&#8208;HNGs) bearing azepines was synthesized via stepwise regioselective cyclodehydrogenation. First, the phenyl&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;bridged dimers were efficiently clipped into highly congested model compounds 1 and 2. Later, the controllable Scholl reactions of the tetraphenyl&#8208;tethered precursor generated 1, 7 or 8 new C&#8722;C bonds, thereby establishing a robust method for the preparation of nonalternant BN&#8208;HNGs with up to 31 fused rings. The helical bilayer nature was unambiguously verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The helical chirality was transferred to the stereogenic boron centers upon fluoride coordination, with a concave&#8208;concave structure to comply with the bilayer skeleton. Notably, the largest nonalternant BN&#8208;HNG (6) spontaneously resolved into a homochiral 41 helix structure as a molecular spiral staircase during crystallization via conglomerate formation at the single&#8208;crystal scale. The large twisted C2&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;surface and the dynamic chiral skeleton induced by curved azepines might have synergistic effects on self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers of 6 to achieve the intriguing spontaneous resolution behavior. The chiroptical properties of the enantiomer of 6 were further investigated, revealing that 6 had a strong chiroptical response in the visible range (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically compared the influence of phosphorescence emission intensity, lifetime, and wavelength on bioimaging performance, demonstrating that the phosphorescence lifetime is the primary factor. Importantly, the inherent ability of Fe ions to quench the phosphorescence of organic phosphorescent materials was verified. Finally, phosphorescent materials were designed for the specific imaging of liver tumors.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. In addition, there have been few reports on organic phosphorescent materials that specifically distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94&#8197;s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ripening Enabled by Hygroscopic Salts for Hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;Free Printable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 20&#8201;%</title>

Room&#8208;temperature ripening induced by the synergy of hygroscopic salt and moisture is reported for preparing efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with efficiency surpassing 20&#8201;%. The post&#8208;treatment enables significant secondary crystallization of perovskite through moisture absorption which liquefies the grain boundary and activates sufficient mass transfer by offering channels and promoting desired dissolution.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskite films generally possess small grain sizes and high density of grain boundaries, which intensify non&#8208;radiative recombination of carriers and limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. In this study, we report the room&#8208;temperature ripening enabled by the synergy of hygroscopic salts and moisture in air for efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs). Treating perovskite films with proper hygroscopic salts in damp air induces obvious secondary recrystallization, which coarsens the grains size from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. It's proposed that the hygroscopic salt at grain boundaries could absorb moisture and form a complex which could not only serve as mass transfer channel but also assist in the dissolution of perovskite grains. This activates mass transfer between small grains and large grains since they possess different solubilities, and thus ripens the perovskite film. Consequently, p&#8208;MPSCs treated with the hygroscopic salt of NH4SCN show an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.13&#8201;% from 17.94&#8201;%, and maintain &gt;98&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point tracking at 55&#177;5&#8201;&#176;C for 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Chiral Supramolecular Assembly: The Importance of Intermolecular Electronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>

We report highly emissive CPL emitter with |glum| values of 0.11 based on organic microcrystals, resulting from the intermolecular electronic coupling in chiral stacking.







Abstract
Herein we report on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission originating from supramolecular chirality of organic microcrystals with a |glum| value up to 0.11. The microcrystals were prepared from highly emissive difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2dbk) dyes R&#8208;1 or S&#8208;1 with chiral binaphthol (BINOL) skeletons. R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;1 exhibit undetectable CPL signals in solution but manifest intense CPL emission in their chiral microcrystals. The chiral superstructures induced by BINOL skeletons were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis. Spectral analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that intermolecular electronic coupling, mediated by the asymmetric stacking in the chiral superstructures, effectively alters excited&#8208;state electronic structures and facilitates electron transitions perpendicular to BF2bdk planes. The coupling increases cos&#952;&#956;,m from 0.05 (monomer) to 0.86 (tetramer) and triggers intense optical activity of BF2bdk. The results demonstrate that optical activity of chromophores within assemblies can be regulated by both orientation and extent of intermolecular electronic couplings.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven Dynamic Combinatorial Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) using a catalytic reaction cycle to form transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. Fueled by a chemical reaction, the library explores liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and advances DCC by engineering peptide structures, paving the way for tunable materials exhibiting emergent, life&#8208;like behaviors.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) creates libraries of molecules that are constantly interchanging in a dynamic combinatorial library. When a library member self&#8208;assembles, it can displace the equilibria, leading to emergent phenomena like its selection or even its replication. However, such dynamic combinatorial libraries typically operate in or close to equilibrium. This work introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry fueled by a catalytic reaction cycle that forms transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. The products in this library exist out of equilibrium at the expense of fuel and are thus regulated by kinetics and thermodynamics. By creating a chemically fueled dynamic combinatorial library with the vast structural space of amino acids, we explored the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behavior of the library members. The study advances DCCs by showing that peptide structures can be engineered to control the dynamic library&#8242;s behavior. The work paves the way for creating novel, tunable material systems that exhibit emergent behavior reminiscent of biological systems. These findings have implications for the development of new materials and for understanding life&#8242;s chemistry.

         <title>In Situ Transformation of an Amorphous Supramolecular Coating to a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane to Trigger Selective Gas Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy has been used for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation. The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: methanol&#8208;activated monomer dissolution facilitates equilibrium shifts, and methanol&#8208;guided hydrogen bonding stabilizes the monomer in a thermodynamically favored state. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.







Abstract
We introduce a &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy, deploying solvent vapor as scaffolds, to fabricate high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes. This strategy can overcome the mismatch in processing conditions and crystal growth thermodynamics faced during the facile solution processing of the membrane. The procedure includes the vapor&#8208;trigged in situ transformation of dense amorphous supramolecules to crystalline HOF&#8208;16, with HOF&#8208;11 as the transient state. The mechanism involves a vapor&#8208;activated dissolution&#8208;precipitation equilibrium shifting and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided molecule rearrangement, elucidated through combined experimental and theoretical analysis. Upon removal of the molecular scaffolds, the resulting HOF&#8208;16 membranes showcase significant improvement in hydrogen separation performance over their amorphous counterparts and previously reported HOF membranes. The method's broad applicability is evidenced by successfully extending it to other substrates and HOF structures. This study provides a fundamental understanding of guest&#8208;induced ordered supramolecular assembly and paves the way for the advanced manufacture of high&#8208;performance HOF membranes for gas separation processes.

         <title>Solution State&#8208;Like Reactivity of a Flexible Crystalline Werner&#8208;Type Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible crystalline Werner&#8208;type Cd(II) complex containing photoreactive ligands displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition type reactivity in the solid state, and associated unique properties including a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced development of porosity.







Abstract
Flexible crystalline solids exhibit unique properties in response to external stimuli like heat and light. However, challenges exist in developing crystalline solids that have similar degrees of flexibility as in solution. Herein, we report the preparation of the new flexible crystalline metal complex [Cd(CF3SO3)2(4&#8208;spy)4] (4&#8208;spy=4&#8208;styrylpyridine), which contains photoreactive 4&#8208;spy ligand. Unlike traditional solids, this metal complex displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition reactivity. Specifically, UV irradiation of the crystalline material leads to formation of the same diverse array of dimers and cis isomer that are generated by photoreaction in the solution state. In addition, the photoresponsive flexibility of the solid leads to a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced formation of pores. The origin of the solution state&#8208;like photoreactivity of the solid is related to properties of the Cd(II) cation and fluorinated CF3SO3 anion, and the multi&#8208;orientational arrangement of the 4&#8208;spy ligands.

         <title>Regulating Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphasial Reactions by Zwitterionic Binder Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes and Silicon&#8208;Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic binder is designed to achieve an anion&#8208;enriched solvation environment on Si&#8208;based anodes with weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Such binder&#8208;regulated SEI is effective in minimizing the catalytic decomposition of the electrolyte and Si devitalization, thus enabling long&#8208;life full cells with Si&#8208;graphite anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes.







Abstract
The practical application of silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes faces challenges due to severe structural and interphasial degradations. These challenges are exacerbated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing Si&#8208;based anodes with high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes, as significant transition&#8208;metal crossover catalyzes serious parasitic side reactions, leading to faster cell failure. While enhancing the mechanical properties of polymer binders has been acknowledged as an effective means of improving solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability on Si&#8208;based anodes, an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the binder chemistry influences the SEI is lacking. Herein, a zwitterionic binder with an ability to manipulate the chemical composition and spatial distribution of the SEI layer is designed for Si&#8208;based anodes. It is evidenced that the electrically charged microenvironment created by the zwitterionic species alters the solvation environment on the Si&#8208;based anode, featuring rich anions and weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. Such a binder&#8208;regulated solvation environment induces a thin, uniform, robust SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes, which is found to be the key to withstanding transition&#8208;metal deposition and minimizing their detrimental impact on catalyzing electrolyte decomposition and devitalizing bulk Si. As a result, albeit possessing comparable mechanical properties to those of commercial binders, the zwitterionic binder enables superior cycling performances in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs under demanding operating conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Template&#8208;Guided Synthesis of High&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies for Humidity Gradient&#8208;Based Power Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organized assembly of fundamental building blocks into intricate molecular architectures remains challenging due to the dynamic building blocks. A general strategy has been developed to synthesize high&#8208;dimensional complex architectures by choosing appropriate anion templates and flexible, non&#8208;planar organic linkers. Further, the complex architecture possesses multifunctions suitable for humidity&#8208;electric power generation.







Abstract
Systematically orchestrating fundamental building blocks into intricate high&#8208;dimensional molecular assemblies at molecular level is imperative for multifunctionality integration. However, this remains a formidable task in crystal engineering due to the dynamic nature of inorganic building blocks. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;template&#8208;guided strategy to control building blocks. The coordination modes of ligands and the spatial hindrance of anionic templates are pivotal in dictating the overall structures. Flexible multi&#8208;dentate linkers selectively promote the formation of oligomeric assembly ([TeO3(Mo2O2S2)3O2(OH)(C5O2H7)3]4&#8722; {TeMo6}) into tetrahedral cages ([(TeO3)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O4P)6]8&#8722; {Te4Mo24} and [(AsO4)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O6)4]12&#8722; {As4Mo24}), while steric hindrance from anionic templates further assists in assembling cages into an open quadruply twisted M&#246;bius nanobelt ([(C6H5O3P)8(Mo2O2S2)24(OH)24(C8H10O4)12]16&#8722; {P8Mo48}). Among these structures, the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic hybrid cage {Te4Mo24} emerges as an exemplary molecular model for proton conduction and serves as a prototype for humidity gradient&#8208;based power generators (HGPGs). The Te4Mo24&#8208;PVDF&#8208;based HGPG (PVDF=Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) exhibits notable stability and power generation, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.51&#8197;V and a current density of 77.8&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Further insights into the interactions between water molecules and microscale molecules within the generator are achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. This endeavor unveils a universal strategy for synthesizing multifunctional integration molecules.

         <title>Dyotropic Rearrangement of an Iron&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the reactivity of an iron&#8208;aluminium complex with CO and isocyanides. DFT calculations suggest that these reactions occur through a dyotropic rearrangement, which is exceedingly rare for bimetallic systems. The rearrangement fundamentally changes the nature of the hydride ligands, exposing new reactivity as evidenced by insertion reactions with CO2, isocyanates, and isocyanides.







Abstract
Ligand exchange processes at metal complexes underpin their reactivity and catalytic applications. While mechanisms of ligand exchange at single site complexes are well established, occurring through textbook associative, dissociative and interchange mechanisms, those involving heterometallic complexes are less well developed. Here we report the reactions of a well&#8208;defined Fe&#8722;Al dihydride complex with exogenous ligands (CO and CNR, R=Me, tBu, Xyl=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3). Based on DFT calculations we suggest that these reactions occur through a dyotropic rearrangement, this involves initial coordination of the exogenous ligand at Al followed by migration to Fe, with simultaneous migration of a hydride ligand from Fe to Al. Such processes are rare for heterometallic complexes. We study the bonding and mechanism of the dyotropic rearrangement through in&#8208;depth computational analysis (NBO, IBOs, CLMO analysis, QTAIM, NCIplot, IGMH), shedding new light on how the electronic structure of the heterometallic core responds to the migration of ligands between metal sites. The dyotropic rearrangement fundamentally changes the nature of the hydride ligands, exposing new nucleophilic reactivity as evidenced by insertion reactions with CO2, isocyanates, as well as isocyanides.

         <title>New Insights for High&#8208;Throughput CO2 Hydrogenation to High&#8208;Quality Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>

The multifunctional catalytic system of the composite NaFeGaZr&amp;HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst exhibits rapid responsiveness to high&#8208;throughput CO2 hydrogenation, leading to the production of liquid fuels that meet commercial gasoline standards. With an impressive space&#8208;time yield of 0.9&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, this achievement bears significant strategic importance for advancing the future development of sustainable energy.







Abstract
In the case of CO2 thermal&#8208;catalytic hydrogenation, highly selective olefin generation and subsequent olefin secondary reactions to fuel hydrocarbons in an ultra&#8208;short residence time is a huge challenge, especially under industrially feasible conditions. Here, we report a pioneering synthetic process that achieves selective production of high&#8208;volume commercial gasoline with the assistance of fast response mechanism. In situ experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the designed NaFeGaZr presents exceptional carbiding prowess, and swiftly forms carbides even at extremely brief gas residence times, facilitating olefin production. The created successive hollow zeolite HZSM&#8208;5 further reinforces aromatization of olefin diffused from NaFeGaZr via optimized mass transfer in the hollow channel of zeolite. Benefiting from its rapid response mechanism within the multifunctional catalytic system, this catalyst effectively prevents the excessive hydrogenation of intermediates and controls the swift conversion of intermediates into aromatics, even in high&#8208;throughput settings. This enables a rapid one&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons without any post&#8208;treatment, with high commercial product compatibility and space&#8208;time yield up to 0.9&#8197;kggasoline&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1. These findings from the current work can provide a shed for the preparation of efficient catalysts and in&#8208;depth understanding of C1 catalysis in industrial level.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Heterobenzylic Amines via Carbonyl Azinylative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium metal&#8208;mediated carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) reaction provides an operationally straightforward protocol for the multicomponent coupling carbonyls, amines and 2&#8208;iodo azines to form &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines. This modular reaction displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. These amines possess a high degree of functionality, are challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs attractive to the design of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Transformations enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines by addition of 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;based nucleophiles to in situ&#8208;generated and non&#8208;activated alkyl&#8208;substituted iminium ions are extremely rare. Approaches involving classical 2&#8208;azinyl organometallics, such as the corresponding Grignard reagents, often fail to produce the desired products. Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2&#8208;azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2&#8208;iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2&#8208;azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2-azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2-iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2-azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2-azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling White Phosphorus: Experimental and Computational Studies Reveal the Mechanisms of P4 Hydrostannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed computational and experimental investigations are reported into the mechanism(s) of P4 hydrostannylation, revealing key factors behind the success of this reaction and important guidelines for the development of future P4 functionalisation chemistry.







Abstract
The hydrostannylation of white phosphorus (P4) allows this crucial industrial precursor to be easily transformed into useful P1 products via direct, &#8216;one pot&#8217; (or even catalytic) procedures. However, a thorough mechanistic understanding of this transformation has remained elusive, hindering attempts to use this rare example of successful, direct P4 functionalization as a model for further reaction development. Here, we provide a deep and generalizable mechanistic picture for P4 hydrostannylation by combining DFT calculations with in situ 31P NMR reaction monitoring and kinetic trapping of previously unobservable reaction intermediates using bulky tin hydrides. The results offer important insights into both how this reaction proceeds and why it is successful and provide implicit guidelines for future research in the field of P4 activation.

         <title>Multiphoton&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Defluorination of Persistent Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Polymers by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl substances and fluorinated polymers were efficiently decomposed to fluoride ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals. The decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and fluorinated polymers (FPs) have been extensively utilized in various industries, whereas their extremely high stability poses environmental persistence and difficulty in waste treatment. Current decomposition approaches of PFASs and FPs typically require harsh conditions such as heating over 400&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a new technique capable of decomposing them under mild conditions. Here, we demonstrated that perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), known as a &#8220;persistent chemical,&#8221; and Nafion, a widely utilized sulfonated FP for ion&#8208;exchange membranes, can be efficiently decomposed into fluorine ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). PFOS was completely defluorinated within 8&#8208;h irradiation of 405&#8208;nm LED light, and the turnover number of the C&#8722;F bond dissociation per NC was 17200. Furthermore, 81&#8201;% defluorination of Nafion was achieved for 24&#8208;h light irradiation, demonstrating the efficient photocatalytic properties under visible light. We revealed that this decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of efficiently breaking down various PFASs and FPs under mild conditions but also paves the way for advancing toward a sustainable fluorine&#8208;recycling society.

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Steric Demand to Control Ligand Exchange and Domain Composition in Stratified Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs having diverse components partitioned into unique domains may exhibit cooperative properties and functions reliant on domain composition and ordering. Inter&#8208;domain ligand exchange scrambles components across domains. This study provides strategies for mitigating ligand exchange and thus controlling domain compositional integrity, factors that are critical for building robust structure&#8211;property relationships in these classes of MOFs.







Abstract
Incorporating diverse components into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can expand their scope of properties and applications. Stratified MOFs (sMOFs) consist of compositionally unique concentric domains (strata), offering unprecedented complexity through partitioning of structural and functional components. However, the labile nature of metal&#8208;ligand coordination handicaps achieving compositionally distinct domains due to ligand exchange reactions occurring concurrently with secondary strata growth. To achieve complex sMOF compositions, characterizing and controlling the competing processes of new strata growth and ligand exchange are vital. This work systematically examines controlling ligand exchange in UiO&#8208;67 sMOFs by tuning ligand sterics. We present quantitative methods for assessing and visualizing the outcomes of strata growth and ligand exchange that rely on high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field images and elemental mapping via scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In addition, we leverage ligand sterics to create &#8216;blocking layers&#8217; that minimize ligand exchange between strata which are particularly susceptible to ligand exchange and inter&#8208;strata ligand mixing. Finally, we evaluate strata compositional integrity in various solvents and find that sMOFs can maintain their compositions for &gt;12&#8197;months in some cases. Collectively, these studies and methods enhance understanding and control over ligand placement in multi&#8208;domain MOFs, factors that underscore careful tunning of properties and function.

         <title>Scalable Production of 2D Non&#8208;Layered Metal Oxides through Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Rapid Redox Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) rapid redox transformation (MRRT) strategy is proposed for mass production of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous metal oxides with non&#8208;layered structure. 39 kinds of 2D oxides, including transition metal oxides, II&#8208;main group oxide, III&#8208;main group oxides, perovskite oxides, high entropy oxides are prepared by the MRRT method, demonstrating its great versatility. These 2D oxides show excellent capacitive deionization properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonlayered metal compounds with porous structure show broad application prospects in electrochemistry&#8208;related fields due to their abundant active sites, open ions/electrons diffusion channels, and faradaic reactions. However, scalable and universal synthesis of 2D porous compounds still remains challenging. Here, inspired by blowing gum, a metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) rapid redox transformation (MRRT) strategy is proposed for the mass production of a wide variety of 2D porous metal oxides. Adequate crosslinking degree of MOG precursor and its rapid redox with NO3&#8722; are critical for generating gas pressure from interior to exterior, thus blowing the MOG into 2D carbon nanosheets, which further act as self&#8208;sacrifice template for formation of oxides with porous and ultrathin structure. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by the fabrication of 39 metal oxides, including 10 transition metal oxides, one II&#8208;main group oxide, two III&#8208;main group oxides, 22 perovskite oxides, four high&#8208;entropy oxides. As an illustrative verification, the 2D transition metal oxides exhibit excellent capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. Moreover, the assembled CDI cell could act as desalting battery to supply electrical energy during electrode regeneration. This MRRT strategy offers opportunities for achieving universal synthesis of 2D porous oxides with nonlayered structures and studying their electrochemistry&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Overall 99&#8201;% (002) Plane Achieves Extreme and Direct Utilization of 95&#8201;% Zn Anode and By&#8208;Product as Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized (002) Zn anodes with an ultra&#8208;high RTC of 99&#8201;% are fabricated on non&#8208;textured substrates by the synergistic action of Mn3+ and H+ via a constant voltage electrodeposition strategy. The anode is capable of stable operation at ultra&#8208;high current densities &amp; areal capacities. Additionally, MnO2, a by&#8208;product of the 99&#8201;% RTC Zn (002) electrodeposition, can be used directly as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life cathode.







Abstract
Zn anode protection in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) face great challenges of high Zn utilization rate (i.e., depth of discharge, DOD) and high current density due to the large difficulty in obtaining an extreme overall RTC (relative texture coefficient) of Zn (002) plane. Through the potent interaction of Mn(III)aq and H+ with distinct Zn crystal planes under an electric field, large&#8208;size Zn foils with a breakthrough (002) plane RTC of 99&#8201;% (i.e., close to Zn single crystal) are electrodeposited on texture&#8208;less substrates, which is also applicable from recycled Zn. The ultra&#8208;high (002) plane RTC remarkably enhances cyclic performance of the Zn anode (70&#8201;% DOD @ 45.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the DOD is even up to 95&#8201;% (@ 28.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with an electrolyte additive of polyaniline. Furthermore, MnO2, the by&#8208;product of electrodeposition, is directly used as cathode of both coin cell and pouch battery, surpassing the cyclic performance exhibited by the majority of Zn||MnO2 batteries in previous instances. These results demonstrate the great potential of our strategy for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale ZIBs.

         <title>Successively Controlling Nanoscale Wrinkles of Ultrathin 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose manipulating MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions to control the synthesis of wrinkled Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;CX nanosheets. Using C1 to C8 acids as modulators, varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alters wrinkle sizes. Increased hydrophobicity strengthens MOF&#8208;MOF interactions and weakens MOF&#8208;solvent interactions, producing larger wrinkles. Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C2, Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C3, and Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 show increased nanoscale wrinkles, with Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 having the largest pores, enhancing GC separation performance.







Abstract
The wrinkles are pervasive in ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, but the regulation of wrinkles is rarely explored systematically. Here, we employed a series of carboxylic acids (from formic acid to octanoic acid) to control the wrinkles of Zr&#8208;BTB (BTB=1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet. The wrinkles at the micrometer scale were observed with transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field (HAADF) images showed lattice distortion in many nanoscale regions, which was precisely matched to the nano&#8208;wrinkles. With the changes of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions were possibly synergistically regulated and wrinkles with different sizes were obtained, which was supported by HAADF, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculation. Different wrinkle sizes resulted in different pore sizes between the Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheet interlayers, providing highly&#8208;oriented thin films and the successive optimization of kinetic diffusion pathways, proved by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and nitrogen adsorption. The most suitable wrinkle pore from Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 exhibited highly efficient chromatographic separation of the substituted benzene isomers. Our work provides a rational route for the modulation of nanoscale wrinkles and their stacked pores of MOF nanosheets and improves the separation abilities of MOFs.

         <title>Structural Basis of Cucurbituril&#8208;Containing Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Chiral Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>

CB[6] favors ordered aggregation into one&#8208;dimensional fibrous nanoarchitectures that greatly facilitates the supramolecular chirality. It suggests the great potential of CB[6] in the preparation and manipulation of supramolecular chiral assemblies, shedding light on the macrocycle&#8208;based functional chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest complexation offers an intriguing protocol in producing chiroptical materials, while the bulky size and dynamic exchange between hosts and guests hinders the ordered aggregation to afford the long&#8208;range chiral arrangement. It remains great challenges in assembling cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) included complexes to induce supramolecular chirality ascribed to the excellent water solubility and flexible packing. Herein, we unveiled the structural basis on the formation of chiroptical coassemblies from CB[n] (n=6, 7) complexes. Perylene diimides (PDIs) with cationic chiral pendants formed complexes in the aqueous media, which selectively showed chiroptical properties. Chlorination at the bay position, increasing alkyl length of cationic chiral pendants or reducing the number of polyaromatic rings would hinder the chiral aggregation. In a comprehensive manner, CB[6] favors ordered aggregation into one&#8208;dimensional fibrous nanoarchitectures that greatly facilitates the supramolecular chirality. In contrast, CB[7] with larger cavity and water solubility shrinks the ordered arrangement of complexes, reducing the formation possibility of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectures. This work suggests the great potential of CB[6] in the preparation and manipulation of supramolecular chiral assemblies, shedding light on the macrocycle&#8208;based functional chiroptical materials.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Acridines by Integrating Photo&#8208;Excitation of o&#8208;Alkyl Nitroarenes with Copper&#8208;Promoted Cascade Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We hereby introduce a potent and modular synthetic strategy for the assembly of valuable acridine architectures, leveraging the synergistic combination of photo&#8208;excitation of o&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with copper&#8208;mediated cascade annulation. This approach facilitates the rapid construction of a diverse collection of symmetric, unsymmetric, and poly&#8208;substituted acridines, which can be seamlessly converted into precious acridinium photocatalysts. Notably, certain members of this class exhibit extraordinary oxidative strength, thereby unlocking immense potential for advancing the realm of photochemical reactions.







Abstract
Acridine frameworks stand as pivotal architectural elements in pharmaceuticals and photocatalytic applications, owing to their chemical adaptability, biological activity, and unique excited&#8208;state dynamics. Conventional synthetic routes often entail specialized starting materials, anaerobic or moisture&#8208;free conditions, and elaborate multi&#8208;stage manipulations for incorporating diverse functionalities. Herein, we present a convergent approach integrating photo&#8208;excitation of readily available ortho&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with copper&#8208;promoted cascade annulation. This innovative system enables an aerobic, one&#8208;pot reaction of o&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with arylboronic acids, thereby streamlining the modular construction of a wide array of acridine derivatives with various functional groups. This encompasses symmetrical, unsymmetrical and polysubstituted varieties, some of which are otherwise exceptionally difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, it significantly improves the production of structurally varied acridinium salts, featuring enhanced photophysical properties, high excited state potentials (E*red=2.08&#8211;3.15&#8197;V), and exhibiting superior performance in intricate photoredox transformations.

This work creates an exciting opportunity to prompt the development of adhesive materials with enhanced properties.







Abstract
Adhesives have been widely used to splice and repair materials to meet practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, developing robust adhesives with balanced adhesive and cohesive properties still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the design and preparation of a robust mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain network (DCMIN) adhesive by orthogonal integration of mechanical bonds and 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) H&#8208;bonding in a single system. Specifically, the UPy moiety plays a dual role: it allows the formation of a cross&#8208;linked network and engages in multivalent interactions with the substrate for strong interfacial bonding. The mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain, serving as the polymeric backbone of the adhesive, is able to effectively alleviate applied stress and uphold network integrity through synergistic intramolecular motions, and thus significantly improves the cohesive performance. Comparative analysis with the control made of the same quadruple H&#8208;bonding network but with non&#8208;interlocked [an]daisy chain backbones demonstrates that our DCMIN possesses superior adhesion properties over a wide temperature range. These findings not only contribute to a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship between microscopic mechanical bond motions and macroscopic adhesive properties but also provide a valuable guide for optimizing design principles of robust adhesives.

         <title>Preformation of Insoluble Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Highly Reversible Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) show promise for future energy storage. However, the dissolution of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) severely deteriorates their performance. Herein, the quantified correlation between SEI solubility and SEI components is established, inspiring a feasible strategy to preform the insoluble SEI with 80.0&#8201;% capacity retention over 900&#8197;cycles in a practical full cell within a commercial electrolyte.







Abstract
A stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for cycling reversibility of Na&#8208;ion batteries by mitigating continuous side reactions. So far, the severe SEI dissolution leads to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and short cycle life. Meanwhile, the quantified relationship between SEI components and their solubility remains unclear. In this work, we establish the direct correlation between SEI components and SEI solubility, and quantify that the solubility of organic&#8208;rich SEI is 3.26&#8197;times of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. We further propose a feasible strategy to preform inorganic&#8208;rich insoluble SEI and demonstrate a practical hard carbon (HC)||NaMn0.33Fe0.33Ni0.33O2 full cell in a commercial electrolyte of 1&#8197;M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 80.0&#8201;% capacity retention for 900&#8197;cycles, and achieve a record&#8208;high average CE of 99.95&#8201;% for a practical Na&#8208;ion full cell. This study provides an effective strategy of preforming insoluble SEI to suppress its dissolution towards highly reversible Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dispersity Polymers via Free Radical Alternating Copolymerization: Effects of Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced free radical polymerization was established to enable scalable preparation of alternating copolymers across low to high dispersities, compatible with fluorinated/non&#8208;fluorinated monomers and binary/ternary/quaternary copolymerizations. The correlation between dispersity control and charge transfer complexes was elucidated through DFT calculations, model experiments and Monte Carlo simulation&#8208;based machine learning methods.







Abstract
Alternating copolymers are crucial for diverse applications. While dispersity (&#208;, also known as molecular weight distribution, MWD) influences the properties of polymers, achieving low dispersities in alternating copolymers poses a notable challenge via free radical polymerizations (FRPs). In this work, we demonstrated an unexpected discovery that dispersities are affected by the participation of charge transfer complexes (CTCs) formed between monomer pairs during free radical alternating copolymerization, which have inspired the successful synthesis of various alternating copolymers with low dispersities (&gt;30&#8197;examples, &#208;=1.13&#8211;1.39) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The synthetic method is compatible with binary, ternary and quaternary alternating copolymerizations and is expandable for both fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated monomer pairs. DFT calculations combined with model experiments indicated that CTC&#8208;absent reaction exhibits higher propagation rates and affords fewer radical terminations, which could contribute to low dispersities. Based on the integration of Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian optimization, we established the relationship map between FRP parameter space and dispersity, further suggested the correlation between low dispersities and higher propagation rates. Our research sheds light on dispersity control via FRPs and creates a novel platform to investigate polymer dispersity through machine learning.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is employed as an electrolyte additive in the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte, which can form a bio&#8208;interfacial layer on the Zinc (Zn) anode via a self&#8208;assembly process. The BSA&#8208;based interfacial layer with hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments forms unique ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions and contributing to improved cycling performance.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion (Zn&#8208;ion) batteries are widely regarded as important candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems for low&#8208;cost renewable energy storage. However, the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries is currently facing significant challenges due to uncontrollable Zn dendrite growth and severe parasitic reactions on Zn metal anodes. Herein, we report an effective strategy to improve the performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries by leveraging the self&#8208;assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) into a bilayer configuration on Zn metal anodes. BSA&#8242;s hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments form unique and intelligent ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions on Zn anodes and leading to a uniform Zn deposition along the Zn (002) plane. Notably, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell with BSA as the electrolyte additive demonstrated a stable cycling performance for up to 2400&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the pivotal role of self&#8208;assembled protein bilayer structures in improving the durability of Zn anodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Quantum Dot&#8208;Based FRET Nanosensors for Talin&#8208;Membrane Assembly and Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a straightforward method for resolving inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular interactions in cell adhesive machinery, using quantum dot (QD) based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Using talin, we are investigating mechanosensing ability of proteins to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. We quantified distance separating talin and a giant unilamellar vesicle membrane and talin mechanosensing capabilities with sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of macromolecular structures in cells relies on solving biomolecular interactions. However, those interactions often remain unclear because tools to track molecular dynamics are not sufficiently resolved in time or space. In this study, we present a straightforward method for resolving inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular interactions in cell adhesive machinery, using quantum dot (QD) based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Using a mechanosensitive protein, talin, one of the major components of focal adhesions, we are investigating the mechanosensing ability of proteins to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. First, we quantified the distances separating talin and a giant unilamellar vesicle membrane for three talin variants. These variants differ in molecular length. Second, we investigated the mechanosensing capabilities of talin, i.e., its conformational changes due to mechanical stretching initiated by cytoskeleton contraction. Our results suggest that in early focal adhesion, talin undergoes stretching, corresponding to a decrease in the talin&#8208;membrane distance of 2.5&#8197;nm. We demonstrate that QD&#8208;FRET nanosensors can be applied for the sensitive quantification of mechanosensing with a sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy.

Second, we investigated the mechanosensing capabilities of talin, i.e., its conformational changes due to mechanical stretching initiated by cytoskeleton contraction. Our results suggest that in early focal adhesion, talin undergoes stretching, corresponding to a decrease in the talin-membrane distance of 2.5&#8197;nm. We demonstrate that QD-FRET nanosensors can be applied for the sensitive quantification of mechanosensing with a sub-nanometer accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Spinel Oxides via Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Phase Boundary Construction for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we prepare CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 as model catalysts to investigate its reconstruction process. The results demonstrate that such a surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel oxides is a spontaneous chemical process, and phase boundary construction from tetrahedral to octahedral units is employed to decrease oxygen vacancy formation energy in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO&#8208;V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO&#8208;V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64&#8201;%, a 3.5&#8197;nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158&#8197;mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8722;T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non&#8208;bonding oxygen states and lowering EO&#8208;V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.

         <title>Biomimetic Activation of N&#8208;Nitrosamides with Red Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release via Mediated Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated electron transfer was successfully developed to selectively activate N&#8208;nitrosamide&#8208;based photoNORMs (NOA) for quantitative NO release, demonstrating its generality across various N&#8208;nitrosamides. This activation mechanism works in both organic solvents and biological media, using micellar nanoparticles to encapsulate NOA and photocatalysts, enabling selective phototoxicity to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo through localized NO release.







Abstract
Mediated electron transfer (MET) is fundamental to many biological functions, including cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and enzymatic catalysis. However, leveraging the MET process to enable the release of therapeutic gases has been largely unexplored. Herein, we report the bio&#8208;inspired activation of a series of UV&#8208;absorbing N&#8208;nitrosamide derivatives (NOA) under red light exposure, enabling the quantitative release of nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitter via an MET process. The cornerstone of our design is the covalent linkage of a 2,4&#8208;dinitroaniline moiety, which acts as an electron mediator to the N&#8208;nitrosamide groups. This facilitates efficient electron transfer from the excited palladium(II) meso&#8208;tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) photocatalyst and the selective activation of NOA. Our approach has been validated with distinct photocatalysts and various N&#8208;nitrosamides, including those derived from carbamates, amides, and ureas. Notably, the modulation of the linker length between the electron mediator and N&#8208;nitrosamide groups serves as a regulatory mechanism for controlling NO release kinetics. Moreover, this biomimetic NO release platform demonstrates effective operation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it enables localized delivery of NO under physiological conditions, exhibiting significant anticancer efficacy within the phototherapeutic window and enhanced selectivity towards tumor cells.

         <title>Modular, Scalable Total Synthesis of Lapparbin with a Noncanonical Biaryl Linkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization enabled total synthesis of the cyclic peptide natural product lapparbin. The key steps to construct the highly strained C&#8722;N biaryl linkage between the Tyr C6 and Trp N1&#8242; centers were found to be applicable to the synthesis of analogues of lapparbin.







Abstract
We report the development of a novel synthetic approach for the highly strained atrop&#8208;Tyr C&#8208;6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp N&#8208;1&#8242; linkage, which can be executed on a decagram scale using a modular strategy involving palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization. The first total synthesis of lapparbin (1) was achieved by applying this synthetic strategy. Furthermore, the modular synthesis utilizing C&#8722;H arylation and Larock macrocyclization, discovered in the total synthesis of lapparbin (1), was demonstrated to be applicable to various arbitrary biaryl linkages, including non&#8208;natural types.

         <title>Phosphetene&#8208;Based Polyaromatics: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships and Chiroptical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phosphetene rings (4&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring) flanked with PAH systems is described. Although neither the P centre nor the four&#8208;membered ring participate in the frontier orbitals, both structural features play an important role in modulating the symmetry of the orbitals, resulting in chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom was used as a chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended phosphetene rings (4&#8208;member P&#8208;rings) flanked with PAH systems of various topologies. These compounds are fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction. The impact of both the polyaromatic platform and the P&#8208;ring on the structure, and the optical and redox properties are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Although neither the P centre nor the 4&#8208;membered ring significantly takes part in the HOMO or LUMO orbitals, both structural features have an important modulating role in distorting the symmetry of the orbitals, leading to chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom is used as a remote chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system. The dissymmetry factor is highly dependent on the polyaromatic topology, as supported by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Durability of Perovskite Solar Cells With Chlorine&#8208;Functionalized Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;functionalized fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs have high specific surface area, stability and long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms. The formation of Cl&#8722;Pb bonds between PAF&#8722;Cl and uncoordinated Pb significantly passivate defects and inhibit non&#8208;radiative recombination, largely enabling the conversion efficiency and stability improvement.







Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative recombination, caused by trap states, significantly hampers the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The emerging porous organic polymers (POPs) show promise as a platform for designing novel defect passivation agents due to their rigid and porous structure. However, the POPs reported so far lack either sufficient stability or clear sites of interactions with the defects. Herein, two chlorine&#8208;functionalized, fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed via a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs feature unique long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms, significantly improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of doped solar cells. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses confirmed the strong passivation effects of conjugated structure to the defect through Cl sites. Specifically, PAF&#8208;159, bearing a triphenylamine moiety, demonstrated stronger Cl&#8722;Pb bonding and higher passivation efficiency due to the presence of &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals, which elevate the HOMO energy level and facilitate Cl&#8722;Pb charge transfer. Consequently, we obtained high&#8208;performance PAF&#8208;159&#8208;doped devices with advanced PCE (24.3&#8201;%), good storage stability (retaining 86&#8201;% after 3000&#8197;hours), and good long&#8208;term operational stability (retaining 92&#8201;% after 350&#8197;hours).

         <title>Surface Gradient Desodiation Chemistry in Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface gradient desodiation strategy is proposed to solve capacity decay and voltage drop without compromising the initial specific capacity of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This tactic not only inhibits transition&#8208;metal&#8208;ion migration at high voltage, but also endows a stable interface by reducing the generation of Ni4+ and Co4+ ions on the surface of the cathode materials.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra&#8208;stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg) cathode material in which a Mg&#8208;free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg&#8208;hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered&#8208;to&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high&#8208;valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The as&#8208;prepared NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000&#8197;cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127&#8197;mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.

         <title>Efficient and Stable NIR&#8208;II Phosphorescence of Metallophilic Molecular Oligomers for In Vivo Single&#8208;Cell Tracking and Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a substituent modulation design, we have developed a series of bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence materials in aqueous solution. Motivated by the excellent brightnesses and microsecond&#8208;level lifetimes, we then performed the in vivo single macrophage tracking and time&#8208;resolved imaging to illustrate the application prospect of NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence in optical imaging.







Abstract
Molecular phosphorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue optical imaging with high contrast by overcoming background fluorescence interference. However, achieving bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence suitable for biological applications remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a new series of symmetric isocyanorhodium(I) complexes that could form oligomers and exhibit bright, long&#8208;lived (7&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;s) phosphorescence in aqueous solution via metallophilic interaction. Ligand substituents with enhanced dispersion attraction and electron&#8208;donating properties were explored to extend excitation/emission wavelengths and enhanced stability. Further binding the oligomers with fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 3.93&#8201;%) and long&#8208;term stability in biological environments, enabling in vivo tracking of single&#8208;macrophage dynamics and high&#8208;contrast time&#8208;resolved imaging. These results pave the way for the development of highly&#8208;efficient NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence for biomedical applications.

         <title>Dynamically Cross&#8208;linked Oligo[2]rotaxane Networks Mediated by Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of DCRN was created by cross&#8208;linking regiospecific oligo[2]rotaxane using metal&#8208;coordination interactions. The dissociation of host&#8211;guest recognition and subsequent sliding motion, along with breakage of metal&#8208;coordination bonds, represented an integrated energy dissipation pathway to enhance mechanical properties of DCRN. Thanks to the orthogonal design of multiple dynamic bonds, the resultant DCRN further exhibited emergent reprocessability and recyclability.







Abstract
Polyrotaxanes (PRs) have attracted significant research attention due to their unique topological structures and high degrees of conformational freedom. Herein, we take advantage of an oligo[2]rotaxane to construct a novel class of dynamically cross&#8208;linked rotaxane network (DCRN) mediated by metal&#8208;coordination. The oligo[2]rotaxane skeleton offers several distinct advantages: In addition to retaining the merits of traditional polymer backbones, the ordered intramolecular motion of the [2]rotaxane motifs introduced dangling chains into the network, thereby enhancing the stretchability of the DCRN. Additionally, the dissociation of host&#8211;guest recognition and subsequent sliding motion, along with the breakage of metal&#8208;coordination interactions, represented an integrated energy dissipation pathway to enhance mechanical properties. Moreover, the resulting DCRN demonstrated responsiveness to multiple stimuli and displayed exceptional self&#8208;healing capabilities in a gel state. Upon exposure to PPh3, which induced network deconstruction by breaking the coordinated cross&#8208;linking points, the oligo[2]rotaxane could be recovered, showcasing good recyclability. These findings demonstrate the untapped potential of the oligo[2]rotaxane as a polymer skeleton to develop DCRN and open the door to extend their advanced applications in intelligent mechanically interlocked materials.

         <title>A Multielectron and High&#8208;Potential Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Posolyte for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research addresses a critical challenge in developing multielectron positive electrolyte (posolyte) with high redox potential for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) as an advanced energy storage technology. The chlorinated spirobifluorene ammonium salts (CSFAs) is synthesized via a green chlorination&#8208;protection mechanism during the initial battery cycling, leveraging side reactions to develop new redox species. A full battery using CFSA&#8208;Cl achieved over 99.4&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and 95&#8201;% capacity utilization for 250 stable cycles.







Abstract
The rising energy demand driven by human activity has posed pressing challenges in embracing renewable energy, necessitating advances in energy storage technologies to maximize their utilization efficiency. Recent studies in aqueous organic redox flow batteries have focused primarily on the development of organic negative electrolytes, while the progress in organic positive electrolytes remains constrained by limitations in their redox potentials and effective electron concentrations. Herein, we report a spatially twisted chlorinated spirobifluorene ammonium salts (CSFAs), created through an unexpected green chlorination&#8208;protection pathway during the initial cycling in the flow battery cell, utilizing chloride ions from counterions in aqueous solution. The chlorinated, nonplanar spiral structure of CSFAs possesses a one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron transfer electrochemical property and offers exceptional resistance to nucleophilic attacks, exhibiting an unprecedented redox potential as high as 1.05&#8197;V (vs. SHE). A full redox flow battery based on CSFA&#8208;Cl (chloride ions as the counter ions) with 1.4&#8197;M electron concentration achieved an average coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.4&#8201;% and a capacity utilization reaching 95&#8201;% of the four&#8208;electron capacity for a stable cycling over 250 cycles (~22&#8197;days). The present work exemplifies the use of side reactions to develop new redox species, which can be extended to create more structurally versatile energy storage materials.

&lt;p&gt;This research addresses a critical challenge in developing multielectron positive electrolyte (posolyte) with high redox potential for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) as an advanced energy storage technology. The chlorinated spirobifluorene ammonium salts (CSFAs) is synthesized via a green chlorination-protection mechanism during the initial battery cycling, leveraging side reactions to develop new redox species.

         <title>Chelator&#8208;Assisted Precipitation&#8208;Based Separation of the Rare Earth Elements Neodymium and Dysprosium from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel chelator, G&#8208;macropa, a highly efficient and environmentally friendly precipitation&#8208;based rare earth element separation approach is achieved.







Abstract
The rare earth elements (REEs) are critical resources for many clean energy technologies, but are difficult to obtain in their elementally pure forms because of their nearly identical chemical properties. Here, an analogue of macropa, G&#8208;macropa, was synthesized and employed for an aqueous precipitation&#8208;based separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+. G&#8208;macropa maintains the same thermodynamic preference for the large REEs as macropa, but shows smaller thermodynamic stability constants. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the binding affinity differences of these chelators for Nd3+ and Dy3+ is a consequence of the presence or absence of an inner&#8208;sphere water molecule, which alters the donor strength of the macrocyclic ethers. Leveraging the small REE affinity of G&#8208;macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd3+, Dy3+, and G&#8208;macropa, the addition of HCO3&#8722; selectively precipitates Dy2(CO3)3, leaving the Nd3+&#8722;G&#8208;macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50&#8201;:&#8201;50 and 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd3+:Dy3+ ratios of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G&#8208;macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Antisite Defect and Coupling Anionic Redox in High&#8208;Voltage Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect and its coupling relationship with anionic redox in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes are revealed using operando neutron diffraction techniques. Further, a strategy that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes is proposed.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2, x&#8805;0.9) can significantly enhance the energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of Li&#8208;ion batteries beyond current levels. However, severe Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high&#8208;voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5&#8197;V cycling stability.

         <title>Direct Excitation Strategy for Deacylative Couplings of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct excitation strategy, despite its versatility and long history in radical generation, is rarely used in metallaphotoredox catalysis due to the lack of suitable radical donors. During our revisit to this chemical tool, we designed the dihydropyrimidoquinolinone (DHPQ) reagents that enable the homolytic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage under visible light, releasing alkyl radicals without photocatalysts (PC). Our method valorizes ketones for diverse deacylative functionalizations (FG) involving C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8722;X bond formation.







Abstract
The homolysis of chemical bonds represents one of the most fundamental reactivities of excited molecules. Historically, it has been exploited to generate radicals under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. However, unlike most contemporary radical&#8208;generating mechanisms, the direct excitation to homolyze chemical bonds and produce aliphatic carbon&#8208;centered radicals under visible light remains rare, especially in metallaphotoredox cross couplings. Herein, we present our design of the dihydropyrimidoquinolinone (DHPQ) reagents derived from ketones, which can undergo formal deacylation and homolytic C&#8722;C bond cleavage to release alkyl radicals without external photocatalysts. Spectroscopic and computational analysis reveal unique optical and structural features of DHPQs, rationalizing their faster kinetics in alkyl radical generation than a structurally similar but visible&#8208;light transparent radical precursor. Such a capability allows DHPQ to facilitate a wide range of Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox cross couplings with aryl, alkynyl and acyl halides. Other catalytic and non&#8208;catalyzed alkylative transformations of DHPQs are also feasible with various radical acceptors. We believe this work would be of broad interest, aiding the synthetic planning with simplified operation and expanding the synthetic reach of photocatalyst&#8208;free approaches in cutting&#8208;edge research.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Ion Covalent Organic Framework Electrolytes Enabled by Nitrile Migration Ladders for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered the key importance of nitrile (&#8722;CN) functionality and for the first time developed a novel single&#8208;ion conducting COF electrolyte (CN&#8722;iCOF) that is high&#8208;voltage stable in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Utilizing Strecker reaction to convert the reversible imine&#8208;based linkage to a stable &#945;&#8208;aminonitrile linkage, azanide&#8208;based anionic centers that are adjacent to the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups were generated followed by deprotonation. When the CN&#8722;iCOF was assembled in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries, excellent performance including stable Li electrodeposition and reversible high&#8208;voltage battery cycling up to 4.5&#8197;V was achieved at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high&#8208;voltage, and energy&#8208;dense lithium metal batteries. Herein, taking advantage of the unique electronic effect of nitrile groups, we designed a novel azanide&#8208;based single&#8208;ion covalent organic framework (CN&#8722;iCOF) structure that possesses effective Li+ transport and high&#8208;voltage stability in lithium metal batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) revealed that electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups not only resulted in an ultralow HOMO energy orbital but also enhanced Li+ dissociation through charge delocalization, leading to a high tLi+ of 0.93 and remarkable oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) simultaneously. Moreover, cyanation leveraging Strecker reaction transformed reversible imine&#8208;linkage to a stable sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing azanide anion, which facilitated contorted alignment of transport &#8220;ladders&#8221; along the one&#8208;dimensional anionic channels and the ionic conductivity could reach 1.33&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at ambient temperature without any additives. As a result, CN&#8722;iCOF allowed operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811), demonstrating stable lithium deposition up to 1,100&#8197;h and reversible battery cycling at ambient temperature up to 4.5&#8197;V, shedding light on the importance of discovering new functionality for forthcoming high&#8208;performance batteries.

&lt;p&gt;We discovered the key importance of nitrile (&#8722;CN) functionality and for the first time developed a novel single-ion conducting COF electrolyte (CN&#8722;iCOF) that is high-voltage stable in solid-state lithium metal batteries. Utilizing Strecker reaction to convert the reversible imine-based linkage to a stable &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-aminonitrile linkage, azanide-based anionic centers that are adjacent to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitrile groups were generated followed by deprotonation. When the CN&#8722;iCOF was assembled in solid-state Li-metal batteries, excellent performance including stable Li electrodeposition and reversible high-voltage battery cycling up to 4.5&#8197;V was achieved at ambient temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid-state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high-voltage, and energy-dense lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Incorporation of Pd Single&#8208;Atom Sites in Perovskite with an Excellent Selectivity toward Photocatalytic Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd active phases have been successfully incorporated in the lattices of SrTiO3 as single&#8208;atom sites (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Pd atoms with an optimized electronic structure and coordination environment facilitate the desorption of alkenes, thereby exhibiting an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability.







Abstract
Semihydrogenation is a crucial industrial process. Noble metals such as Pd have been extensively studied in semihydrogenation reactions, owing to their unique catalytic activity toward hydrogen activation. However, the overhydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes often happens due to the rather strong adsorption of alkenes on Pd active phases. Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of Pd active phases as single&#8208;atom sites in perovskite lattices such as SrTiO3 can greatly alternate the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pd active phases to facilitate the desorption of alkenes rather than further hydrogenation. Furthermore, the incorporated Pd sites can be well stabilized without sintering by a strong host&#8211;guest interaction with SrTiO3 during the activation of H species in hydrogenation reactions. As a result, the Pd incorporated SrTiO3 (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) exhibits an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability for the photocatalytic semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene. This strategy based on incorporation of active phases in perovskite lattices will have broad implications in the development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Formulating Self&#8208;Repairing Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dynamic Electric Double Layer for Practical Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the EDL structure to construct stable SEI in situ provides a promising approach to solve the electrolyte/electrode interface problem. We have developed a dual&#8208;site adsorption additive to construct the dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing in situ SEI for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc ion batteries, filling the gap in understanding the EDL structure and SEI properties.







Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) encounter interface issues stemming from the water&#8208;rich electrical double layer (EDL) and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose the dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing hybrid SEI for practical ZIBs via incorporating the horizontally&#8208;oriented dual&#8208;site additive. The rearrangement of distribution and molecular configuration of additive constructs the robust dynamic EDL under different interface charges. And, a self&#8208;repairing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid SEI is constructed via the electrochemical decomposition of additive. The dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing SEI accelerate interfacial kinetics, regulate deposition and suppress side reactions in the both stripping and plating during long&#8208;term cycles, which affords high reversibility for 500&#8197;h at 42.7&#8201;% depth of discharge or 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, Zn//NVO full cells deliver the impressive cycling stability for 10000&#8197;cycles with 100&#8201;% capacity retention at 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and for over 3000&#8197;cycles even at lean electrolyte (7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mAh&#8722;1) and high loading (15.26&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated in the low&#8208;temperature full cell (&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Subsurface Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Enabled by Mechanochemical Synthesis for Oxidation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical approach has been shown to be an effective method of regulating the position of single atoms. Controlling single atoms at the surface or subsurface results in catalysts with very different adsorption properties, leading to different reaction mechanisms. As a result, the subsurface Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst shifts the conversion profile 80&#8197;K towards the low&#8208;temperature region and NH3 is completely converted at 513&#8197;K.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional atom utilization and unique properties. However, the practical application of these catalysts is often impeded by challenges such as sintering&#8208;induced instability and poisoning of isolated atoms due to strong gas adsorption. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical method to insert single Cu atoms into the subsurface of Fe2O3 support. By manipulating the location of single atoms at the surface or subsurface, catalysts with distinct adsorption properties and reaction mechanisms can be achieved. It was observed that the subsurface Cu single atoms in Fe2O3 remained isolated under both oxidation and reduction environments, whereas surface Cu single atoms on Fe2O3 experienced sintering under reduction conditions. The unique properties of these subsurface single&#8208;atom catalysts call for innovations and new understandings in catalyst design.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Assisted Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte is proposed by introducing weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran into commonly used propylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, which simultaneously achieves the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity. These merit the gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with accelerated desolvation process, guaranteeing the fast&#8208;charging performance of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid ester-ether electrolyte is proposed by introducing weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran into commonly used propylene carbonate-based electrolyte, which simultaneously achieves the anion-reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity. These merit the gradient inorganic-rich electrode-electrolyte interface with accelerated desolvation process, guaranteeing the fast-charging performance of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading.

         <dc:description>
The first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles with multiple elements of stereogenicity has been established via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols. This new type of alkene atropisomers possess promising utilities such as in discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective preparation of alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements and discovery of their applications have become significant but challenging issues in the scientific community due to the unique structures of this class of atropisomers. We herein report the first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles, a new kind of alkene atropisomers, with stereogenic point and axial chirality via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols under asymmetric organocatalysis. Notably, this novel type of alkene atropisomers have promising applications in developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts, discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Moreover, the theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction mechanism and the non&#8208;covalent interactions to control the enantioselectivity. This approach offers a new synthetic strategy for alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements, and represents the first catalytic enantioselective rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols, which will advance the chemistry of atropisomers and chiral indole chemistry.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Driven Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction to C2H4 on Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Copper Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suface plasmon&#8208;driven highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 has been realized on ionic liquid&#8208;mediated Cu nanowires. The addition of ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, which brings about electron&#8208;rich surface sites that stabilize the *CO intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2H4 product with high selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) feedstocks, such as C2H4, holds great promise in direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. Nevertheless, the performance is largely inhibited by the high energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2+ products with low selectivity. Here we report that through facile surface immobilization of a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM&#8208;BF4) ionic liquid, plasmonic Cu nanowires could enable highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 product. At an optimal condition, the resultant plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits C2H4 production with selectivity up to 96.7&#8201;% under 450&#8197;nm monochromatic light irradiation, greatly surpassing its pristine Cu counterpart. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations unravel that the addition of EMIM&#8208;BF4 ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, resulting in its enhanced adsorption strength of *CO intermediate and significantly reduced energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process. This work paves new path for Cu surface plasmons in selective artificial photosynthesis to targeted products.

         <title>Customizing Aniline&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures to Attain beyond 22&#8201;% Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose the utilization of an aniline&#8208;derived molecule, namely 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline (MFA), as an additive for the fabrication of CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx solar cells. The incorporation of MFA into the perovskite film can effectively enhance the energy barrier for defect formation and ion migration. This customized strategy allows us to achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 22.14&#8201;% and significantly improved environmental stability and photostability.







Abstract
The characteristics of the soft component and the ionic&#8208;electronic nature in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite typically lead to a significant number of halide vacancy defects and ions migration, resulting in a reduction in both photovoltaic efficiency and stability. Herein, we present a tailored approach in which both anion&#8208;fixation and undercoordinated&#8208;Pb passivation are achieved in situ during crystallization by employing a molecule derived from aniline, specifically 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline (MFA), to address the above challenges. The incorporation of MFA into the perovskite film results in a pronounced inhibition of ion migration, a significant reduction in trap density, an enhancement in grain size, an extension of charge carrier lifetime, and a more favorable alignment of energy levels. These advantageous characteristics contribute to achieving a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.14&#8201;% for the MFA&#8208;based CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite solar cells (PSCs), representing the highest efficiency reported thus far for this type of inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the resultant PSCs exhibits higher environmental stability and photostability. This strategy is anticipated to offer significant advantages for large&#8208;area fabrication, particularly in terms of simplicity.

         <title>Photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Thianthrenation of Aryl and Heteroaryl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective decarboxylative thianthrenation of a broad range of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids forming high value&#8208;added (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salt reagents has been achieved under mild conditions, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these abundant starting materials, as exemplified here by modifications a series of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Given that (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids are inexpensive materials available in a great variety from commercial and natural resources or synthesis, the strategies enabling their use as starting materials for preparing fine chemicals are highly sought after. Here we report a photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;mediated protocol converting (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, high value&#8208;added building blocks that can undergo various subsequent transformations, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these ubiquitous starting materials. The excellent compatibility of the method is shown by preparing a broad range of sterically and electronically varied (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, including derivatives of pharmaceuticals, such as ataluren, celecoxib, flavoxate, probenecid, repaglinide, and tamibarotene. The syntheses of 13&#8197;C&#8208;labeled probenecid and bioisosteres of ataluren as well as the unconventional modifications of celecoxib and flavoxate, illustrate the synthetic potential of the strategy. Mechanistic studies are in line with a reaction occurring through a photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) of Cu(II)&#8208;arylcarboxylates, enabling radical decarboxylative carbometallation to form arylcopper(II) intermediates that in turn react with thianthrene to form the product. Noteworthy, the susceptibility of aryl thianthrenium salts to photodegradation is overcome by a Cu(I)&#8208;driven salvage loop, which continuously intercepts the transiently formed radicals and regenerates the products.

&lt;p&gt;Chemoselective decarboxylative thianthrenation of a broad range of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids forming high value-added (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salt reagents has been achieved under mild conditions, creating an attractive two-step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these abundant starting materials, as exemplified here by modifications a series of pharmaceuticals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids are inexpensive materials available in a great variety from commercial and natural resources or synthesis, the strategies enabling their use as starting materials for preparing fine chemicals are highly sought after. Here we report a photoinduced Cu(II)-mediated protocol converting (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, high value-added building blocks that can undergo various subsequent transformations, creating an attractive two-step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these ubiquitous starting materials. The excellent compatibility of the method is shown by preparing a broad range of sterically and electronically varied (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, including derivatives of pharmaceuticals, such as ataluren, celecoxib, flavoxate, probenecid, repaglinide, and tamibarotene. The syntheses of 13&#8197;C-labeled probenecid and bioisosteres of ataluren as well as the unconventional modifications of celecoxib and flavoxate, illustrate the synthetic potential of the strategy. Mechanistic studies are in line with a reaction occurring through a photoinduced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) of Cu(II)-arylcarboxylates, enabling radical decarboxylative carbometallation to form arylcopper(II) intermediates that in turn react with thianthrene to form the product. Noteworthy, the susceptibility of aryl thianthrenium salts to photodegradation is overcome by a Cu(I)-driven salvage loop, which continuously intercepts the transiently formed radicals and regenerates the products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dihydropyridopyrazine Functionalized Xanthene: Generating Stable NIR Dyes with Small&#8208;Molecular Weight by Enhanced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a modular structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. Owing to its great charge separation feature, the dihydropyridopyrazine significantly enhanced the internal charge transfer states of traditional fluorophores, resulting in greatly redshifted wavelengths of the reconstructed dyes together with a small molecular weight increase, retained stability and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared region (NIR; 650&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyes offer many advantages over traditional dyes with absorption and emission in the visible region. However, developing new NIR dyes, especially organic dyes with long wavelengths, small molecular weight, and excellent stability and biocompatibility, is still quite challenging. Herein, we present a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a charge separation structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. These novel NIR dyes not only exhibited greatly redshifted wavelengths compared to their parent dyes, but also displayed a small molecular weight increase together with retained stability and biocompatibility. Specifically, dye NIR&#8208;OX, a dihydropyridopyra&#8208;zine derivative of oxazine with a molecular mass of 386.2&#8197;Da, exhibited an absorption at 822&#8197;nm and an emission extending to 1200&#8197;nm, making it one of the smallest molecular&#8208;weight NIR&#8208;II emitting dyes. Thanks to its rapid metabolism and long wave&#8208;length, NIR&#8208;OX enabled high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and assessment of cholestatic liver injury in vivo and also facilitated the evalua&#8208;tion of the efficacy of liver protection medicines against cholestatic liver injury.

2,4,6&#8208;Tris(3&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (3P) with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing moieties was reported to modulate perovskite quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (P&#8208;QLEDs). Profiting from excellent interfacial passivation, electron injection, carrier mobility, hole blocking, and thermal stability of 3P, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.2&#8201;% and operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;h at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were realized, representing one of the highest performances in P&#8208;QLEDs.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs), abbreviated as P&#8208;QLEDs have been regarded as significantly crucial emitters for lighting and displays. Efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs still lack ideal electron transport materials (ETM), which could efficiently block hole, transport electron, reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination and possess high thermal stability. Here, we report 2,4,6&#8208;Tris(3&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl) biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TmPPPyTz, 3P) with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing moieties of pyridine and triazine to modulate the performance of P&#8208;QLEDs. Compared with commonly used 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi), the pyridine in 3P have a strong interaction with perovskites, which can effectively suppress the interface non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by the Pb2+ defects on the surface of QDs. In addition, 3P have deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (enhancing hole&#8208;blocking properties), matched lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and excellent electron mobility (enhancing electron transport properties), realizing the carrier balance and maximizing the exciton recombination. Furthermore, high thermal resistance of 3P obviously improves the stability of QDs under variable temperature, continuous UV illumination, and electric field excitation. Resultantly, the P&#8208;QLEDs using the 3P as ETM achieved an outstanding performance with a champion EQE of 30.2&#8201;% and an operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 151&#8201;% and about 11&#8208;fold improvement compared to control devices (EQE=20&#8201;%, T50=297&#8197;hours), respectively. These results provide a new concept for constructing the efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs from the perspective of selective ETM.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough, yet Rigid and Healable Supramolecular Polymers with Variable Stiffness for Multimodal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers were developed by incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs into densely interconnected hydrogen networks, achieving both exceptional mechanical strength and dynamic chain flexibility. These materials can be utilized to create variable stiffness layers for soft actuators, enhancing their motion versatility and structural robustness.







Abstract
Variable stiffness materials have shown considerable application in soft robotics. However, previously reported materials often struggle to reconcile high stiffness, stretchability, toughness, and self&#8208;healing ability, because of the inherently conflicting requisite of these properties in molecular design. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that involves incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs capable of from strong crosslinking sites into a dense and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to construct rigid self&#8208;healing polymers with tunable stiffness and excellent toughness. To demonstrate these distinct features, the polymer was employed to serve as the strain&#8208;regulation layers within a fiber&#8208;reinforced pneumatic actuator (FPA). The exceptional synergy between the configuration versatility of FPA and the dynamic molecular behavior of the supramolecular polymers equips the actuator with simultaneous improvement in motion dexterity, multimodality, loading capacity, robustness, and durability. Additionally, the concept of integrating high dexterity at both macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale is prospective to inspire the design of intelligent yet robust devices across various domains.

         <title>A Microscopically Heterogeneous Colloid Electrolyte for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Calendar&#8208;Life Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolyte is engineered to tackle the critical issues of inadequate fast&#8208;charging capability and limited calendar life in silicon&#8208;based batteries. Leveraging multiscale noncovalent interactions, this electrolyte demonstrates exceptional fast&#8208;charging capability. Moreover, the mesoscopic medium in the colloid electrolyte strongly adsorbs H2O and HF, significantly extending the calendar life of the full cell.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life are critical metrics in rechargeable batteries, especially in silicon&#8208;based batteries that are susceptible to sluggish Li+ desolvation kinetics and HF&#8208;induced corrosion. No existing electrolyte simultaneously tackles both these pivotal challenges. Here we report a microscopically heterogeneous covalent organic nanosheet (CON) colloid electrolyte for extremely fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations and operando Raman spectroscopy reveal the fundamental mechanism of the multiscale noncovalent interaction, which involves the mesoscopic CON attenuating the microscopic Li+&#8208;solvent coordination, thereby expediting the Li+ desolvation kinetics. This electrolyte design enables extremely fast&#8208;charging capabilities of the full cell, both at 8&#8197;C (83.1&#8201;% state of charge) and 10&#8197;C (81.3&#8201;% state of charge). Remarkably, the colloid electrolyte demonstrates record&#8208;breaking cycling performance at 10&#8197;C (capacity retention of 92.39&#8201;% after 400 cycles). Moreover, benefiting from the robust adsorption capability of mesoporous CON towards HF and water, a notable improvement is observed in the calendar life of the full cell. This study highlights the role of microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolytes in enhancing the fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life of Si&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. Our work offers fresh perspectives on electrolyte design with multiscale interactions, providing insightful guidance for the development of alkali&#8208;ion/metal batteries operating under harsh environments.

     alt="A Microscopically Heterogeneous Colloid Electrolyte for Extremely Fast-Charging and Long-Calendar-Life Silicon-Based Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolyte is engineered to tackle the critical issues of inadequate fast-charging capability and limited calendar life in silicon-based batteries. Leveraging multiscale noncovalent interactions, this electrolyte demonstrates exceptional fast-charging capability. Moreover, the mesoscopic medium in the colloid electrolyte strongly adsorbs H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF, significantly extending the calendar life of the full cell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-charging capability and calendar life are critical metrics in rechargeable batteries, especially in silicon-based batteries that are susceptible to sluggish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation kinetics and HF-induced corrosion. No existing electrolyte simultaneously tackles both these pivotal challenges. Here we report a microscopically heterogeneous covalent organic nanosheet (CON) colloid electrolyte for extremely fast-charging and long-calendar-life Si-based lithium-ion batteries. Theoretical calculations and operando Raman spectroscopy reveal the fundamental mechanism of the multiscale noncovalent interaction, which involves the mesoscopic CON attenuating the microscopic Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent coordination, thereby expediting the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation kinetics. This electrolyte design enables extremely fast-charging capabilities of the full cell, both at 8&#8197;C (83.1&#8201;% state of charge) and 10&#8197;C (81.3&#8201;% state of charge). Remarkably, the colloid electrolyte demonstrates record-breaking cycling performance at 10&#8197;C (capacity retention of 92.39&#8201;% after 400 cycles). Moreover, benefiting from the robust adsorption capability of mesoporous CON towards HF and water, a notable improvement is observed in the calendar life of the full cell. This study highlights the role of microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolytes in enhancing the fast-charging capability and calendar life of Si-based Li-ion batteries. Our work offers fresh perspectives on electrolyte design with multiscale interactions, providing insightful guidance for the development of alkali-ion/metal batteries operating under harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Anions&#8208;in&#8208;Colloid&#8221; Hydrated Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte was designed, where the anions are trapped in the colloid and the H2O molecules are restricted by the eutectic network, thus enabling high reversible zinc anodes over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Zn metal as a promising anode for aqueous batteries suffers from severe zinc dendrites, anion&#8208;related side reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and narrow electrochemical stable window (ESW). Herein, an &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte consisting of Zn(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), and H2O with mass ratio of 7&#8201;:&#8201;4.5&#8201;:&#8201;3 (ACDE&#8208;3) is designed to improve the stability of zinc anode. The ACDE&#8208;3 reconfigures the hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network and regulates the solvation shell. More importantly, the hydroxyl&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;&#8208;CDs) in ACDE&#8208;3 self&#8208;assemble into micelles, in which the steric effect between adjacent &#946;&#8208;CDs in micelles restricts the movement of anions. This unique &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; structure enables the eutectic system with a high Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+) of 0.84. Thus, ACDE&#8208;3 inhibits the formation of dendrite, prevents the anion&#8208;involved side reactions, suppresses the HER, and enlarges the ESW to 2.32&#8197;V. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell delivers a long lifespan of 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn//Cu half cells have a high average columbic efficiency (ACE) of 97.9&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from cycle 15 to 200 with a uniform and compact zinc deposition. When matched with a poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine) (poly(1, 5&#8208;NAPD)) cathode, the full battery with a low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio of 2 can still cycle steadily for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, this electrolyte has been proven to be operative over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules deposited on polycrystalline cobalt are strongly hybridised with the inorganic surface and experience charge transfer from the cobalt. This is reflected in the modification of the interface electronic structure inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. In their Research Article (e202403495) M. Benedetta Casu et&#8197;al. report a method, based on X&#8208;ray spectroscopies, that helps to screen in a simple way organic/ferromagnetic interfaces for applications in spintronics.

Challenges exist in developing crystalline solids that have similar degrees of flexibility as in solution. In their Research Article (e202407924), Tomoyuki Akutagawa, Shin&#8208;ichiro Noro et&#8197;al. report that a flexible crystalline Werner&#8208;type Cd(II) complex containing photoreactive ligands displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition type reactivity in the solid state, and associated unique properties including a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced development of porosity.

A &#8220;solution&#8211;processing&#8211;transformation&#8221; strategy with methanol scaffolds for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation is explored by Zixi Kang, Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407779). The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: vapor&#8208;activated monomer dissolution&#8211;precipitation equilibrium shifts, and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided monomer rearrangement. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.

         <title>Using In situ Transmission Electron Microscopy to Study Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is currently a prominent subject of study in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Comprehending the atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of SMSI is crucial for directing the design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts. This article reviews the latest advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) research on SMSI. It also offers a concise overview of the obstacles and potential solutions for future progress in this emerging domain.







Abstract
Precisely controlling the microstructure of supported metal catalysts and regulating metal&#8208;support interactions at the atomic level are essential for achieving highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) not only stabilizes metal nanoparticles and improves their resistance to sintering but also modulates the electrical interaction between metal species and the support, optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, understating the formation mechanism of SMSI and its dynamic evolution during the chemical reaction at the atomic scale is crucial for guiding the structural design and performance optimization of supported metal catalysts. Recent advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have shed new light on these complex phenomena, providing deeper insights into the SMSI dynamics. Here, the research progress of in situ TEM investigation on SMSI in heterogeneous catalysis is systematically reviewed, focusing on the formation dynamics, structural evolution during the catalytic reactions, and regulation methods of SMSI. The significant advantages of in situ TEM technologies for SMSI research are also highlighted. Moreover, the challenges and probable development paths of in situ TEM studies on the SMSI are also provided.

Progress in the development of non&#8208;alternant nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs, including N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon (5&#8211;7)&#8197;pairs, N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon (5&#8211;8)&#8197;pairs and N&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;heptagon (7&#8211;7)&#8197;pairs, is comprehensively covered&#160;in this review. The synthesis, structure analysis, and photophysical properties have been highlighted to shed light on the structure&#8211;property relationships and to realize emerging applications for organic optoelectronics.







Abstract
Introduction of non&#8208;hexagons and/or heteroatoms allows for finely tuning the physicochemical properties of nanographenes. Heteroatoms doping have dominated the modulation of nanographenes with tunable band gap, rich electrochemical activities and so on. The pair of non&#8208;hexagons, for instance, pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs, have furnished nanographenes with aromatic and/or antiaromatic characteristics, open&#8208;shell properties and so on. In order to meet the growing demand for versatile nanographenes in materials science, research on novel nanographenes with heteroatom doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs has been aroused in recent years. In this review, we focus on nanographenes with nitrogen&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal paris including the synthesis, structure analysis, photophysical properties, and potential applications in organic devices.

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a Minireview which describes recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles. This Minireview mainly highlights the developments in the asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles. It will to provide a stepping stone for further investigations by summarizing and discussing the recent developments in the area of synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles.







Abstract
Planar&#8208;chiral skeletons widely exist in natural products, bioactive compounds, and other functional molecules. Although significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric synthesis of centrally or axially chiral molecules over the past years, enantioselective constructing of planar chirality is still a big obstacle and numerous efforts have been made in this field.

         <title>Identification of Kibdelomycin and Related Biosynthetic Gene Clusters and Characterization of the C&#8208;Branching of Amycolose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes are characterized in detail for many different reactions. However, only a few examples are known to catalyze the C&#8208;branching of deoxy&#8208;keto sugars. The first ThDP&#8208;dependent &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase to catalyze such a reaction was characterized in the biosynthesis of kibdelomycin. The sterically demanding tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone is subsequently converted by an amino transferase.







Abstract
Many bacterial natural products contain C&#8208;branched sugars, including components from the outer cell wall or antibiotically active metabolites. The enzymatic C&#8208;branching of keto sugars leading to longer side chains (&#8805;C2) is catalyzed by thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes. Chiral tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are formed in this process. The ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze C&#8208;branching reactions belong to one of three enzymatic superfamilies: decarboxylases, transketolases, and &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenases 2, but branching of keto sugars has only been demonstrated for decarboxylases. In this study, we showed that an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase is responsible for C&#8208;branching of the deoxyketo sugar amycolose in the biosynthesis of kibdelomycin in Kibdelosporangium sp. MA7385. In addition, we characterized an amino transferase in the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that accepts a sterically demanding tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone in a downstream reaction. Subsequently, we identified approximately 400 similar BGCs in silico, suggesting that there is a large diversity of possible ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyzing the C&#8208;branching of keto sugars and subsequent modifications.

         <title>Controlled Protein&#8208;Membrane Interactions Modulate Self&#8208;Organization of Min Protein Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organization of proteins is a fundamental process in living systems. The Zieske research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen now reconstituted snowflake&#8208;like patterns using purified proteins and synthetic lipid membranes. Their work reveals membrane linkage as a key biophysical parameter, determining whether proteins self&#8208;organize into expanding snowflake&#8208;like patterns or into travelling surface waves.







Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing protein patterns are crucial for living systems, governing important cellular processes such as polarization and division. While the field of protein self&#8208;organization has reached a point where basic pattern&#8208;forming mechanisms can be reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins, understanding how cells can dynamically switch and modulate these patterns, especially when transiently needed, remains an interesting frontier. Here, we demonstrate the efficient regulation of self&#8208;organizing protein patterns through the modulation of simple biophysical membrane parameters. Our investigation focuses on the impact of membrane affinity changes on Min protein patterns at lipid membranes composed of Escherichia coli lipids or minimal lipid compositions, and we present three major results. First, we observed the emergence of a diverse array of pattern phenotypes, ranging from waves over flower&#8208;shaped patterns to snowflake&#8208;like structures. Second, we demonstrated the dependency of these patterns on the density of protein&#8208;membrane linkers. Finally, we demonstrate that&#160;the shape of snowflake&#8208;like patterns is&#160;fine&#8208;tuned by membrane charge. Our results demonstrate the significant influence of membrane linkage as a straightforward biophysical parameter governing protein pattern formation. Our research points towards a simple yet intriguing mechanism by which cells can adeptly tune and switch protein patterns on the mesoscale.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed sequential asymmetric hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs has been developed, providing a robust approach to chiral silacyclopentane featuring consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent stereocontrol. Mechanistic studies disclosed that this reaction undergoes a sequential intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant homoallylic silanes.







Abstract
Despite impressive advances in the construction of enantioenriched silacarbocycles featuring silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers via a selection of well&#8208;defined sila&#8208;synthons, the development of a more convenient and economic method with readily available starting materials is significantly less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first example of copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation of readily accessible methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) and primary silanes, affording an efficient and convenient route to a wide range of chiral silacyclopentanes bearing consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &#8805;98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions combine copper&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant Z/E mixture of homoallylic silanes.

         <title>Regioselective Oxidative Phenol Coupling by a Mushroom Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phlegmacin biosynthesis in the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer reveals that CoUPO1, an unspecific peroxygenase, catalyzes the dimerization step by regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative phenol coupling. This study demonstrates that mushrooms evolved aryl coupling independently of any other group of organisms.







Abstract
Bioactive dimeric (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are ubiquitous in nature and are found in bacteria, fungi, insects, and plants. Their biosynthesis via oxidative phenol coupling (OPC) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, peroxidases, or laccases. While the biocatalysis of OPC in molds (Ascomycota) is well&#8208;known, the respective enzymes in mushroom&#8208;forming fungi (Basidiomycota) are unknown. Here, we report on the biosynthesis of the atropisomers phlegmacin A1 and B1 of the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer. The biosynthesis of these unsymmetrically 7,10&#8217;&#8208;homo&#8208;coupled dihydroanthracenones was heterologously reconstituted in the mold Aspergillus niger. Methylation of the parental monomer atrochrysone to its 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl ether torosachrysone by the O&#8208;methyltransferase CoOMT1 precedes the regioselective homocoupling to phlegmacin, catalyzed by the enzyme CoUPO1 annotated as an &#8220;unspecific peroxygenase&#8221; (UPO). Our results reveal an unprecedented UPO reaction, thereby expanding the biocatalytic portfolio of oxidative phenol coupling beyond the commonly reported enzymes. The results show that Basidiomycota use peroxygenases to selectively couple aryls independently of and convergently to any other group of organisms, emphasizing the central role of OPC in natural processes.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Mimetic Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic molecular mimic metal&#8208;free catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized graphite exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and 99&#8201;% selectivity for the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
The direct construction of metal&#8208;free catalysts on conductive substrates for electrocatalytic organic hydrogenation reactions is significant but still unexplored. Here, learning from the homogeneous molecular catalysts, an organic molecular mimetic metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, 99&#8201;% selectivity and 96&#8201;% yield of the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. The removal of these oxygen&#8208;containing groups leads to negligible activity. The experimental and calculation results reveal that the origin of the high activity can be assigned to the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups on graphite. A flow electrolytic cell delivers ten grams of hydrogenated products with 81&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. This metal&#8208;free catalyst is also suitable for gas&#8208;phase acetylene semihydrogenation and other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Zr(OH)4&#8208;Catalyzed Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Phenylacetylene with Terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H as Active Site: Inactive for Free Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr(OH)4 was firstly applied to catalyze semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. It can achieve a 95&#8201;% removal rate of 1&#8201;%&#8201;mol of phenylacetylene in styrene, and the terminal hydroxyl group is confirmed as the active site.







Abstract
In the field of industrial semi&#8208;hydrogenation of trace alkynes amidst alkene feedstocks, the pivotal challenge lies in circumventing the hydrogenation of alkenes. Herein, we present Zr(OH)4 as an innovative catalyst for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, demonstrating remarkable selectivity towards styrene (&gt;96&#8201;%), while exhibiting inactivity towards free styrene. Notably, Zr(OH)4 achieves a 95&#8201;% conversion of quasi&#8208;industry 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% phenylacetylene within styrene, with a mere 0.44&#8201;% styrene loss. Experimental and theoretical results confirm both terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H and bridge Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H can dissociate H2, while the terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H plays a crucial role on activating phenylacetylene through the sequential hydrogenation process of C6H5C&#8801;CH&#8594;C6H5C=CH2&#8594;C6H5CH=CH2. The high rate of phenylacetylene removal is attributed to its strong adsorption capacity, while Zr(OH)4 has a significantly weaker adsorption capacity for styrene.

         <title>Dual Channel Emissions of Kasha and Anti&#8208;Kasha from a Single Radical Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable mono&#8208;radical counterpart of the chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabins's hydrocarbon displays dual&#8208;channel emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. This coexistence of two types of luminescence is observed for the first time in the field of luminescent radicals.







Abstract
Stable open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals have recently attracted much attention due to their unique luminescence properties. However, a radical molecule with both Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha doublet emission properties has not been reported. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a stable chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabin's hydrocarbon, TTM&#8208;TTM, along with its mono&#8208;radical counterpart, TTM&#8208;HTTM. The emission of TTM&#8208;TTM follows Kasha's rule in the near infrared region. However, TTM&#8208;HTTM shows dual channel doublet emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. Remarkably, these two types of emission compete dynamically in both solution and condensed states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the rational design and discovery of stable radicals that possess distinctive luminescent properties, thus broadening the horizons of luminescent materials research.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea from CO2 and Nitrate by a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main challenge for urea electrosynthesis is to operate at both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. Here, we report a sustainable method for urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; using a novel MOF catalyst, PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, achieving high efficiency and stability, and demonstrating potential for industrial scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes. The main challenge hindering the progress of this technology lies in the development of advanced electrocatalysts that efficiently utilize abundant, low&#8208;cost CO2 and nitrogen sources to yield urea with both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. In this work, we designed and prepared a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, constructed by nickel&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) ligands and square&#8208;planar FeO4 nodes, as the electrocatalyst for urea electrosynthesis. PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O exhibits remarkable performance to yield urea at a high current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a high FE(urea) of 54.1&#8201;% in a neutral aqueous solution, surpassing those of most reported electrocatalysts. No obvious performance degradation was observed over 20&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By expanding the electrode area to 25&#8197;cm2 and operating for 8&#8197;hours, we obtained 0.164&#8197;g of high&#8208;purity urea, underscoring its potential for industrial applications. Mechanism study unveiled the enhanced performance might be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between NiPc and FeO4 sites. Specifically, NH3 produced at the FeO4 site can efficiently migrate and couple with the *NHCOOH intermediate adsorbed on the urea&#8208;producing site (NiPc). This synergistic effect results in a lower energy barrier for C&#8722;N bond formation than those of the reported catalysts with single active sites.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Dependent Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Transport in a Perylenediimide Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductor</title>

The contrasting behaviour of 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the presence of sodium and potassium ions is leveraged to create an n&#8208;type perylene diimide based organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor that responds selectively to potassium ions with a two order of magnitude higher current response than in the presence of sodium ions.







Abstract
A rapidly growing interest in organic bioelectronic applications has spurred the development of a wide variety of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. While these new mixed conductors have enabled the community to interface organic electronics with biological systems and efficiently transduce biological signals (ions) into electronic signals, the current materials selection does not offer sufficient selectivity towards specific ions of biological relevance without the use of auxiliary components such as ion&#8208;selective membranes. Here, we present the molecular design of an n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) perylene diimide semiconductor material decorated with pendant oligoether groups to facilitate interactions with cations such as Na+ and K+. Using the cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 oligoether motif, we find that the resulting mixed conductor PDI&#8208;crown displays a strong dependence on the size of the electrolyte cation when tested in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration. In stark contrast to the low current response on the order of 1&#8197;&#956;A observed with aqueous sodium chloride, a nearly 200&#8208;fold increase in current is observed with aqueous potassium chloride. We ascribe the high selectivity to extended molecular aggregation and therefore efficient charge transport in the presence of K+ due to a favourable sandwich&#8208;like structure between two adjacent 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 motifs and the potassium ion.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Assembly of Glycan Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy granted access to previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, allowing for molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of carbohydrates.







Abstract
A comprehensive molecular understanding of carbohydrate aggregation is key to optimize carbohydrate utilization and to engineer bioinspired analogues with tailored shapes and properties. However, the lack of well&#8208;defined synthetic standards has substantially hampered advances in this field. Herein, we employ a phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, including elongated platelets, helical bundles, and hexagonal particles. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis provided molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of these oligosaccharides, establishing a direct connection between the resulting morphologies and the oligosaccharide primary sequence. Our findings demonstrate that ETA is a powerful approach to elucidate the intrinsic aggregation behavior of carbohydrates in nature. Moreover, the ability to access a diverse array of morphologies, expanded with a non&#8208;natural sequence, underscores the potential of ETA, coupled with sequence design, as a robust tool for accessing programmable glycan architectures.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraborate node has been shown to facilitate the formation of 3D ionic covalent organic frameworks with flexible linkers. Irreversible deprotonation acts as a kinetic control to achieve high polymerization, while the dynamic B&#8722;O bond aids error correction. This approach has been investigated with three organic monomers and two metal counterions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated the intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high degree of polymerization. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counterions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials have been tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.

         <title>Fence&#8208;Type Molecular Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To attain high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries, we've proposed a novel strategy for fence&#8208;type molecular electrocatalyst. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer (as catalyst), via nucleophilic substitution formation, creates a reaction space for multiphase transformation of sulfur species. And the uniformly distributed CE sites on the polymer regulate the molecular structures of sulfur species through coordination, boosting the overall redox kinetics.







Abstract
Improving the slow redox kinetics of sulfur species and shuttling issues of soluble intermediates induced from the multiphase sulfur redox reactions are crucial factors for developing the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. In this study, we successfully constructed a novel molecular electrocatalyst through in situ polymerization of bis(3,4&#8208;dibromobenzene)&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (BD18C6) with polysulfide anions on the cathode interface. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer acts as a spatial &#8220;fence&#8221; to precisely control the unique redox characteristics of sulfur species, which could confine sulfur substance within its interior and interact with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to optimize the reaction barrier of sulfur species. The &#8220;fence&#8221; structure and the double&#8208;sided Li+ penetrability of the CE molecule may also prevent the CE catalytic sites from being covered by sulfur during cycling. This new fence&#8208;type electrocatalyst mitigates the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, enhances the redox activity of sulfur species, and promotes the formation of three&#8208;dimensional stacked lithium sulfide (Li2S) simultaneously. It thus enables lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to exhibit superior rate performance and cycle stability, which may also inspire development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy&#8208;efficient conversion process.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Polymers Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers were synthesized by integrating chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone. The chiral polymers showed narrowband emission, high PLQY and large |glum| value. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited EQEmax of 9.8&#8201;%, |gEL| of 0.07, and FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This is the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers combining high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self&#8208;assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named R&#8208;PBN and S&#8208;PBN, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490&#8197;nm with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79&#8201;%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self&#8208;assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|glum|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.8&#8201;%, intense CPEL activities with |gEL| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self-assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN-moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named &lt;b&gt;R-PBN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;S-PBN&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490&#8197;nm with full-width half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79&#8201;%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self-assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution-processed nondoped CP-OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 9.8&#8201;%, intense CPEL activities with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self-assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; value and narrowband emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Kalmanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol was achieved by using a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, aldol/elimination reaction to assemble the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations.







Abstract
Kalmanol, the flagship member of the kalmane diterpene family, possesses a complex and highly oxidized 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton with nine contiguous stereocenters and exhibits significant analgesic effects and cardiotoxic properties. We have achieved the efficient total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol in 22&#8197;steps with 2.3&#8201;% yield. The synthesis featured a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations of the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton.

         <title>Enantioselective S&#8208;Alkylation of Sulfenamides by Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 and an average yield of 94&#8201;% across a broad scope of inputs is achieved. Development of a catalyst to synthesize the opposite enantiomer with high selectivity and a demonstration of the utility of the method via application to the synthesis of a drug candidate is shown.







Abstract
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Essential to achieving high selectivity was the use of the triethylacetyl sulfenamide protecting group along with aqueous KOH as the base under biphasic aqueous conditions to enable the reaction to be performed at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. With these key parameters, enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 at the newly generated chiral sulfur center were achieved with an inexpensive cinchona alkaloid derived PTC. Broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility was observed for a variety of S&#8208;(hetero)aryl and branched and unbranched S&#8208;alkyl sulfenamides. Moreover, to achieve high selectivity for the opposite enantiomer, a pseudoenantiomeric catalyst was designed and synthesized from inexpensive cinchonidine. Given that sulfoximines are a bioactive pharmacophore of ever&#8208;increasing interest, selected product sulfilimines were oxidized to the corresponding sulfoximines with subsequent reductive cleavage affording the free&#8208;NH sulfoximines in high yields. The utility of the disclosed method was further demonstrated by the efficient asymmetric synthesis of atuveciclib, a phase I clinical candidate for which only chiral HPLC separation had previously been reported for isolation of the desired (R)&#8208;sulfoximine stereoisomer.

         <title>Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed by Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective annulation of aldehydes and ketones with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes generating chiral tetrahydrofurans is presented. For both aldehydes and ketones high yields and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained. Some intriguing mechanistic aspects are discussed, and stereoselective transformations are demonstrated.







Abstract
The substituted tetrahydrofuran core is a structural motif in many biologically active and natural compounds. However, the scarcity of enantioselective methods developed towards its synthesis makes this field challenging and attractive to explore. Herein, the first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with aldehydes and ketones affording enantioenriched 2,3,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans is reported. The reaction concept is based on activation of racemic &#946;&#8208;cyclopropyl ketones by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base which catalyzes the (3+2) annulation for a range of aldehydes and ketones. For aldehydes, the annulation furnished tetrahydrofurans in excellent yield, good diastereoselectivity and with excellent enantioselectivity up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Surprisingly, aromatic aldehydes afforded the cis&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans as the major diastereoisomer, while for aliphatic aldehydes the trans&#8208;cycloadduct was favored. The reaction also proceeds well for ketones affording spiro tetrahydrofurans in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Hammett studies have been conducted to elucidate the influence of the electronic nature of benzaldehydes on the stereoselectivity. Based on the diastereochemical outcome for the aldehydes, two reaction paths for aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes are proposed. Finally, two diastereoselective synthetic transformations have been conducted to demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Modular Synthesis of Oxetane&#8208;Based Amide Bioisosteres: Concise, Robust and Scalable Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step, modular and scalable construction of amino&#8208;oxetanes for the purpose of bioisosteric incorporation has been developed using Katritzky's benzotriazole chemistry. This simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol provides easy access to a range of amino&#8208;oxetanes, even those previously considered challenging. This method is expected to further lower the barrier to adoption of amino&#8208;oxetanes in drug development.







Abstract
Amide bioisoterism is a widely used strategy in drug development to fine&#8208;tune physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties, eliminate toxicity and gain intellectual property rights in uncharted chemical space. Of these, oxetane&#8208;amines offer particularly exciting possibilities as bioisosteres, although they are less frequently investigated than warranted due to the lack of simple and widely applicable synthetic methods. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step, practical, modular, robust, and scalable method for the construction of oxetane&#8208;containing amide bioisosteres that relies on the readily available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This operationally simple procedure exploits the enhanced reactivity of the keto group of the commercially available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to form amine&#8208;benzotriazole intermediates, which springloaded adducts are then reacted with various aliphatic and aromatic organometallic reagents under mild conditions to afford various amino&#8208;oxetanes in good to high yields. The simplicity and broad applicability of the method greatly facilitates the synthesis of derivatives that were previously difficult or impossible to produce. The usefulness of this method in the field medicinal chemistry was also demonstrated by eliminating the well&#8208;known metabolic problem of ketoconazole.

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Chemistry in Aqueous Ammonium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

         <title>Orthogonal Persulfide Generation through Precision Tools Provides Insights into Mitochondrial Sulfane Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.

         <title>Front Cover: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <dc:description>
In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo. The compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids. Their elemental composition has been determined by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals. In addition, there is a mass&#8208;spectrometry evidence for the recurrent formation of further thiaborane homologs of closo&#8208;SBnCln with n=4, 6, 10, and supra&#8208;icosahedral 12.

         <title>Novel Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Interactions in Polymer&#8208;Derived Sodium&#8208;Doped Amorphous Si&#8722;B&#8722;N Ceramic: Towards Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

&lt;p&gt;We explored the Polymer-Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal-free sodium-doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. This FLP-inspired approach promises advances in main-group-mediated heterogeneous catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest is growing in transition metal-free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium-doped amorphous silicon-boron-nitride (Na-doped a-SiBN). Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and 3-fold coordinated B&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) activation within Na-doped a-SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; moieties surrounded by SiN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units contributing to the transformation of the B&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; moieties into 4-fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;= sites with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a charge-compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;B&lt;sup&gt;FLA&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;(Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)=).

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

Small Fish, big moves: In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure.

&lt;p&gt;Copper-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/GSH, enabling real-time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques.

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo-catalytically generated [(bTAML)Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(bTAML)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species (where bTAML stands for biuret-modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-&#956;-oxo radical cation and Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high-valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.
