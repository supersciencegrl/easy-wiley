      <title>Selective Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aromatic Five&#8208;Membered Sulfur Heterocycles from Alkynes with a Proton Acid/N&#8208;Chlorophthalimide System</title>
      <dc:description>Described here is a multicomponent strategy to achieve two different regioselectivities from alkynes, isothiocyanates and H  2  O with a proton acid/N&#8208;chlorophthalimide (NCPI) system, selectively obtaining non&#8208;aromatic five&#8208;membered sulfur heterocycles: 1,3&#8208;oxathiol&#8208;2&#8208;imines/thiazol&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one derivatives through multiple bond formations. The process features readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208; selectivities,   gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage modifications. Mechanistic studies support that the transformation process includes a combination of H  2  O and isothiocyanate, free radical formation, carbonation and intramolecular cyclization to give the products. Furthermore, the 1,3&#8208;oxathiol&#8208;2&#8208;imine derivatives with unique fluorescence characteristics, can be served as metal ions Pd  2+  sensor with &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; response, showing potential applications in environmental and biological fields.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Despite their excellent selectivities and activities, Mo&#8208;and W&#8208;based catalysts for olefin metathesis have not gained the same widespread use as Ru&#8208;based systems, mainly due to their inherent air&#8208;sensitivity.

They catalyze olefin metathesis reactions of substrates containing functional groups such as (thio&#8208;) esters, (thio&#8208;) ethers and alcohols without the need for prior activation, e.g. by a Lewis acid. The presence of a nitrile ligand was found to be essential for their stability towards air, while no decrease in activity and productivity could be observed upon coordination of a nitrile. Variations of the imido and anionic ligand revealed that alkoxide complexes with electron&#8208;withdrawing imido ligands offer the highest reactivities and excellent stability compared to analogous triflate and halide complexes. The molybdenum imido alkylidene NHC nitrile complexes maintain their selectivity for the formation of  trans  &#8208;isotactic poly(norbornene)s.</dc:description>

This study reports the first photocatalytic generation of &#960;&#8208;allyltitanium complexes via a radical strategy.

      <dc:description>Utilizing a chiral bicyclic imidazole organocatalyst and adopting a continuous injection process, an alternative route has been developed for the efficient synthesis of chiral phthalidyl ester prodrugs via dynamic kinetic resolution of 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalides by enantioselective acylation (up to 99% ee).

      <title>Metallo&#8208;Helicoid with Double Rims: Polymerization Followed by Folding via Intramolecular Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we established a feasible strategy to construct a new type of metallo&#8208;polymer with helicoid&#8208;like structure through the combination of covalent polymerization and intramolecular coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. In the design, a tetratopic monomer (  M  ) was prepared with two terminal alkynes in the outer rim for polymerization, and two terminal terpyridines (TPYs) in the inner rim for subsequent folding by selective intramolecular coordination. Then, the linear covalent polymer (  P  ) was synthesized by polymerization of  M  through Hay&#8208;Glaser homocoupling reaction. Finally, intramolecular coordination interactions between TPYs and Zn(II) folded the backbone of  P  into a right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed metallo&#8208;helicoid (  H  ) with double rims. Due to multiple positive charges on the inner rim of helicoid, double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules (dsDNA) could interact with  H  via electrostatic interactions. Remarkably, dsDNA allowed exclusive formation of  H  with right handedness by means of chiral induction. Furthermore, the interaction with DNA molecules led to the enhancement of luminescent efficiency of  H  through restricted intramolecular motions. The processes of encapsulation of DNA molecules were able to be probed by time&#8208;dependent fluorescent spectroscopy.

      <title>Directing the rate&#8208;enhancement for hydronium ion catalyzed dehydration via organization of alkanols in nanoscopic confinements</title>
      <dc:description>Alkanol dehydration rates catalyzed by hydronium ions are enhanced by the dimensions of steric confinements of zeolite pores as well as by intraporous intermolecular interactions with other alkanols. The higher rates with zeolite MFI having pores smaller than those of zeolite BEA for dehydration of secondary alkanols, 3&#8208;heptanol and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol, is caused by the lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confinements of MFI that offsets a less positive activation entropy. The higher activity in BEA than in MFI for dehydration of a tertiary alkanol, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol, is primarily attributed to the reduction of the activation enthalpy by stabilizing intraporous interactions of the C  &#946;  &#8208;H transition state with surrounding alcohol molecules. Overall, we show that the positive impact of zeolite confinements results from the stabilization of transition state provided by the confinement and intermolecular interaction of alkanols with the transition state, which is impacted by both the size of confines and structure of alkanols in the E1 pathway of dehydration.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Nanoscale Infrared Spectroscopy of Water Adsorption on Nano&#8208;Islands of Surface&#8208;Anchored Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Despite technological advancements, probing gas&#8208;solid interfaces at the nanoscale is still a formidable challenge. New nano&#8208;spectroscopic methods are needed to understand guest&#8208;host interactions of functional materials during gas sorption, separation, and conversion. Here we introduce  in situ  Photo&#8208;induced Force Microscopy (PiFM) to evidence site&#8208;specific interaction between metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and water. To this end, we developed amphiphilic surface&#8208;anchored MOF (SURMOF) model systems using self&#8208;assembly for the side&#8208;by&#8208;side hetero&#8208;growth of nanodomains of hydrophilic HKUST&#8208;1 and hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8. PiFM was used to probe local uptake kinetics and to show D  2  O sorption isotherms on (defective) HKUST&#8208;1 paddlewheels. By monitoring defect vibrations, we visualized in real&#8208;time the saturation of existing defects and the creation of D  2  O&#8208;induced defects.

      <title>Engineering Micrometer&#8208;sized DNA Tracks for High&#8208;Speed DNA Synthesis and Biosensing</title>
      <dc:description>&#981;29 DNA polymerase (Pol&#981;29) is capable of synthesizing long&#8208;chain single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA molecules by copying the sequence of a small ss circular DNA template (ssCDT) in a process known as rolling circle amplification (RCA). The use of a ssCDT in RCA, however, comes with a key drawback: the rate of DNA synthesis is significantly reduced. We hypothesize that this issue can be overcome using a very long linear ssDNA template with a repeating sequence. To test this idea, we have engineered a special DNA assembly which we denote &#8220;micrometer&#8208;sized DNA track&#8221; or simply &#181;DT. This &#181;DT, with an average length of ~13.5 &#181;m, is made of a long chain DNA with a primer&#8208;binding domain at its 3&#8242; end and ~1000 repeating sequence units at its 5&#8242; end each carrying a DNA anchor. We find that Pol&#981;29 copies &#181;DT at a speed ~5&#8208;time faster than it does a related ssCDT. We take advantage of this finding by designing a simple all&#8208;in&#8208;one printed paper device for rapid and sensitive detection of microRNA let&#8208;7. This paper sensor is capable of detecting 1 pM let&#8208;7a in just 10 minutes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the Surface Oxidation of Cu Nanowires Improves Their Catalytic Selectivity and Stability toward C2+ Products in CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Copper nanostructures are promising catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 because of their unique ability to produce a large proportion of multi&#8208;carbon products. Despite major progress, the selectivity and stability of such catalysts still need to be substantially improved. Here we demonstrate that controlling the surface oxidation of Cu nanowires (CuNWs) can greatly improve their C2+ selectivity and stability. Specifically, we achieve a faradaic efficiency as high as 57.7 and 52.0% for ethylene when the CuNWs are oxidized by the O2 from air and aqueous H2O2, respectively, and both of them show hydrogen selectivity below 12%. The high yields of C2+ products can be mainly attributed to the increase in surface roughness and the generation of defects and cavities during the electrochemical reduction of oxide layer.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Copper nanostructures are promising catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 because of their unique ability to produce a large proportion of multi&#8208;carbon products. Despite major progress, the selectivity and stability of such catalysts still need to be substantially improved. Here we demonstrate that controlling the surface oxidation of Cu nanowires (CuNWs) can greatly improve their C2+ selectivity and stability.

      <dc:description>The introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ov) has been regarded as an effective method to enhance the catalytic performance of photoanodes in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their stability under highly oxidizing environment is questionable but was rarely studied. Herein, NiFe&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (NiFe&#8208;MOFs) was conformally coated on oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiVO  4  (Ov&#8208;BiVO  4  ) as the protective layer and cocatalyst, forming a  core&#8208;shell  structure with caffeic acid as bridging agent. The as&#8208;synthesized Ov&#8208;BiVO  4  @NiFe&#8208;MOFs exhibits enhanced stability and a remarkable photocurrent density of 5.3&#177;0.15 mA cm  &#8722;2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The reduced coordination number of Ni(Fe)&#8208;O and elevated valence state of Ni(Fe) in NiFe&#8208;MOFs layer greatly bolster OER, and the shifting of oxygen evolution sites from Ov&#8208;BiVO  4  to NiFe&#8208;MOFs promotes Ov stabilization.

      <dc:description>Inspired by the exquisite helices in Nature, fabrication of helical materials with controlled handedness has attracted considerable attention. Herein, we report on precis synthesis of single left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helical polyisocyanides through living polymerization of achiral monomers using chiral palladium catalysts under helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner.

      <title>Controlling Intramolecular F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer and Singlet Fission in a Subporphyrazine&#8208;Pentacene Conjugate by Solvent Polarity</title>
      <dc:description>Due its complementary absorptions in the range of 450 and 600 nm, an energy&#8208;donating hexaaryl&#8208;subporphyrazine has been linked to a pentacene dimer, which acts primarily as energy acceptor and secondarily as a singlet fission enabler. In the corresponding conjugate, efficient intramolecular F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (i&#8208;FRET) is the modus operandi to transfer energy from the subporphyrazine to the pentacene dimer. Upon energy transfer, the pentacene dimer undergoes intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF), that is, converting the singlet excited state, via an intermediate state, into a pair of correlated triplet excited states. Solvatochromic fluorescence of the subporphyrazine is a key feature of this system and features a red&#8208;shift as large as 20 nm in polar media. Solvent is thus used to modulate spectral overlap between the fluorescence of subporphyrazine and absorption of the pentacene dimer, which controls the F&#246;rster rate constant, on one hand, and the triplet quantum yield, on the other hand. The optimum spectral overlap is realized in xylene, leading to F&#246;rster rate constant of 3.52 &#215; 10  11  s  &#8211;1  and a triplet quantum yield of 171% &#177; 10%. In short, the solvent polarity dependence, which is a unique feature of subporphyrazines, is decisive in terms of adjusting spectral overlap, ensuring a sizable F&#246;rster rate constant, and maximizing triplet quantum yields. Uniquely, this optimization can be achieved without a need for synthetic modification of the subporphyrazine donor.</dc:description>

      <title>Introducing tox&#8208;Profiles of Chemical Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
In this Essay we propose tox&#8208;Profiles of chemical reactions to eliminate misleading preconceptions about the biological activity of organic molecules and to stimulate further progress in the field. tox&#8208;Profiles can be used to classify synthetic reactions, mange the biological activity of molecules, and guide the rational development of new methodologies.







Abstract
In this Essay, we present a critical analysis of two common practices in modern chemistry&#8212;that is, of using speculations about the &#8220;greenness&#8221; and &#8220;nontoxicity&#8221; of developed synthesis procedures and of a priori labelling various compounds derived from natural sources as being environmentally safe. We note that every organic molecule that contains functional groups should be biologically active. Thus, analysis of the particular greenness and the potential environmental impact of a given chemical process should account for the biological activity of all its components in a measureable (rather than empirical) way. We highlight the necessity of clarifying discussions on biological activity and toxicity and propose possible ways of introducing tox&#8208;Profiles as a reliable overview of the overall toxicity of chemical reactions.

      <title>Engineering Atomically Dispersed FeN4 Active Sites for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>Atomically dispersed FeN  4  active sites have exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. However, the understanding behind the intrinsic and morphological factors contributing to the catalytic properties of FeN  4  sites is still lacking. Using a Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C model catalyst derived from the ZIF&#8208;8, we deconvoluted three key morphological and structural elements of FeN  4  sites, including particle sizes of catalysts, Fe content, and Fe&#8208;N bond structures. Their monotonous effects on the CO2RR were comprehensively elucidated. Engineering the particle size and Fe doping is critical to control extrinsic morphological factors of FeN  4  sites for optimal porosity, electrochemically active surface areas, and the graphitization of the carbon support. In contrast, the intrinsic activity of FeN  4  sites was only tunable by varying thermal activation temperatures during the formation of FeN  4  sites, which impacted the length of the Fe&#8208;N bonds and the local strains. The structural evolution of Fe&#8208;N bonds was characterized at the atomic level. First&#8208;principles calculations further elucidated the origin of intrinsic activity improvement associated with the optimal local strain on the Fe&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Dye&#8208;Doped Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced ECL&#8208;Based Immunoassay Analytical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Using silica nanoparticles, a 8.5&#8208;fold higher ECL intensity was achieved with respect to a system mimicking a commercial immuno&#8208;sensing system, benefiting from the deep knowledge acquired by combining ECL with nanostructures.







Abstract
The combination of highly sensitive techniques such as electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with nanotechnology sparked new analytical applications, in particular for immunoassay&#8208;based detection systems. In this context, nanomaterials, particularly dye&#8208;doped silica nanoparticles (DDSNPs) are of high interest, since they can offer several advantages in terms of sensitivity and performance. In this work we synthesized two sets of monodispersed and biotinylated [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;doped silica nanoparticles, named bio&#8208;Triton@RuNP and bio&#8208;Igepal@RuNP, obtained following the reverse microemulsion method using two different types of nonionic surfactants. Controlling the synthetic procedures, we were able to obtain nanoparticles (NPs) offering highly intense signal, using tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as coreactant, with bio&#8208;Triton@RuNps being more efficient than bio&#8208;Igepal@RuNP.

      <title>Interlayer Engineering of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 Modulates Selective Hydronium Intercalation in Neutral Aqueous Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>Among various charge carrier ions for aqueous batteries, non&#8208;metal hydronium (H3O+) with small ionic size and fast diffusion kinetics empowers H3O+&#8208;intercalation electrodes with high rate performance and fast&#8208;charging capability. However, pure H3O+  charge carriers for inorganic electrode materials have only been observed in corrosive acidic electrolytes, rather than in mild neutral electrolytes. Here, we report how selective H3O+  intercalation in a neutral ZnCl2  electrolyte can be achieved for water&#8208;proton co&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3  (denoted WP&#8208;MoO3  ). H2O molecules located between MoO3  interlayers are disclosed to block Zn2+  intercalation pathways while allowing smooth H3O+  intercalation/diffusion through a Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. Compared to &#945;&#8208;MoO3  with Zn2+&#8208;intercalation mechanism, WP&#8208;MoO3  delivers the substantially enhanced specific capacity (356.8  vs.  184.0 mA h g&#8722;1), rate capability (77.5%  vs.  42.2% from 0.4 to 4.8 A g&#8722;1), and cycling stability (83%  vs.  13% over 1000 cycles). This work demonstrates the possibility of modulating electrochemical intercalating ions by interlayer engineering, which indicates a promising direction to construct high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life electrodes for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

Understanding how, when, and why these parameters change under operating conditions is of uttermost importance for designing stable, active, and selective catalysts. Here, we study the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based nanocatalysts during the startup phase of the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction by combining results from electrochemical in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We reveal that dissolution followed by redeposition, rather than coalescence, is the mechanism responsible for the size increase and morphology change of the electrocatalyst. Furthermore, we point out the key role played by the formation of copper oxides in the process. Understanding of the underlying processes opens a pathway to rational design of Cu electro (re)deposited catalysts and to stability improvement for catalysts fabricated by other methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of hydrophilic monomer distribution on self&#8208;assembly of a pH&#8208;responsive copolymer: Spheres, worms and vesicles from a single copolymer composition</title>
      <dc:description>A series of copolymers containing 50 mol% acrylic acid (AA) and 50 mol% butyl acrylate (BA) but with differing composition profiles ranging from an AA&#8208;BA diblock copolymer to a linear gradient poly(AA&#8208;  grad  &#8208;BA) copolymer were synthesized and their pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior was investigated. While assemblies of the AA&#8208;BA diblock copolymer were kinetically frozen, the gradient&#8208;like compositions underwent reversible changes in size and morphology in response to changes in pH. In particular, a diblock copolymer consisting of two random copolymer segments of equal length (16 mol% and 84 mol% AA respectively) formed spherical micelles at pH &gt; 5, a mix of spherical and worm&#8208;like micelles at pH 5 and vesicles at pH 4. These assemblies were characterized by dynamic light scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of copolymers containing 50 mol% acrylic acid (AA) and 50 mol% butyl acrylate (BA) but with differing composition profiles ranging from an AA&#8208;BA diblock copolymer to a linear gradient poly(AA&#8208;  grad  &#8208;BA) copolymer were synthesized and their pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior was investigated. While assemblies of the AA&#8208;BA diblock copolymer were kinetically frozen, the gradient&#8208;like compositions underwent reversible changes in size and morphology in response to changes in pH. In particular, a diblock copolymer consisting of two random copolymer segments of equal length (16 mol% and 84 mol% AA respectively) formed spherical micelles at pH &amp;gt; 5, a mix of spherical and worm&#8208;like micelles at pH 5 and vesicles at pH 4. These assemblies were characterized by dynamic light scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational Design of Memory&#8208;Based Sensors:&#160; the Case of Molecular Calorimeters</title>
      <dc:description>Thermodynamic characterization is crucial for understanding molecular interactions. However, methodologies for measuring heat changes in small open systems are extremely limited. We document a new approach for designing molecular sensors that function as calorimeters: sensors based on memory. To design a memory&#8208;based sensor, we take advantage of the unique kinetic properties of nucleic acid scaffolds. Particularly, we elaborate on the differences in folding and unfolding rates in nucleic acid quadruplexes.

We translated this behaviour into a molecular memory function that enables the measurement of heat changes in open environments. The new sensors are biocompatible, operate homogeneously, and measure small heats released over long time periods. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate how the molecular calorimeters report heat changes generated in water/propanol mixing and in ligand/protein binding.</dc:description>

      <title>MOF&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Crystalline Ionic Liquid with Enhanced Proton Conduction</title>
      <dc:description>Arranging ionic liquids (ILs) with long&#8208;range order can not only enhance their performances in a desired application, but can also help elucidate the vital relationship between structure and properties. However, achieving long&#8208;range ordered ILs is still a formidable challenge and no successful example has been reported to date. In this work, we report a feasible strategy to achieve a crystalline IL via coordination self&#8208;assembly based reticular chemistry. The first crystalline IL bearing a long&#8208;range ordered framework,  IL  1  MOF  , was prepared by designing an IL bridging ligand and then connecting them with metal clusters.  IL  1  MOF  possesses a very unique structure, where the IL ligands are arranged on a long&#8208;range ordered framework but have a labile ionic center. This structure enables  IL  1  MOF  to break through the typical limitation where the solid ILs have lower proton conductivity than their counterpart bulk ILs.  IL  1  MOF  shows 2&#8208;4 orders of magnitude higher proton conductivity than its counterpart IL monomer across a wide temperature range. Its conductivity is also an order magnitude higher than the highest reported values for solid protic IL derivatives and MOF&#8208;based anhydrous proton conductors at room temperature. Moreover, by confining the IL within ultramicropores (&lt; 1 nm),  IL  1  MOF  suppresses the liquid&#8208;solid phase transition temperatures to lower than &#8208;150  o  C, allowing it to function with high conductivity in a subzero temperature range. This work is expected to open a toolbox for designing new&#8208;generation IL materials for important applications.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Strategy to Control Viscosity Sensitivity of Molecular Rotor&#8208;Based Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular rotor&#8208;based fluorophores (RBFs) have been widely used in many fields. However, it remained enigmatic how to rationally control their viscosity sensitivity, thus limiting their application. Herein, we resolve this problem by chemically installing extended &#960;&#8208;rich alternating carbon&#8208;carbon linkage between the rotational electron donor and acceptor of RBFs. Our data reveal that the length of &#960;&#8208;rich linkage strongly influences the viscosity sensitivity, likely resulted from varying height of the energy barriers between the fluorescent planar and the dark twisted configurations. This mechanism allows for the design of three scaffolds of RBF derivatives that span a wide range of viscosity sensitivities. Application of these RBFs is demonstrated by a dual&#8208;color imaging strategy that can differentiate misfolded protein oligomers and insoluble aggregates both in test tubes and live cells. Beyond RBFs, we envision that this chemical mechanism might be generally applicable to a wide range of photoisomerizable and aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorophores.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperation of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes on a Gold Surface</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular zippers based on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are reported by S. Amirjalayer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010634). The structure of a gold surface is modified with atomic precision by the cooperative interplay of molecular ballbots formed in&#8208;situ by the carbenes at the gold surface. By elucidating the elementary steps and proving the swarm&#8208;like behavior of these nanoscale tools the possibility of developing well&#8208;defined nanostructured interfaces at room temperature is demonstrated.

      <dc:description>
A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is important for the construction of molecular and electronic devices. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006318), Y. Tian et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond is highly stable under thiol&#8208;abundant conditions and shows better electrochemical performance compared to Au&#8722;S and Au&#8722;Se bonds. Based on the remarkable performance of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, a Fe2+ electrochemical sensor was developed and applied in the biosensing and analyzing of Fe2+ in live brain.

Theoretical investigation based on  ab initio  anharmonic algorithms reveals that the observed band splitting and its extraordinarily large gap of ~300 cm  &#8208;1  is a result of strong coupling between fundamental of the proton stretching mode and overtone states of the two proton bending modes, that is commonly known as Fermi resonance (FR). We also provide a simple and general theoretical model to link the strong FR coupling to the quasi&#8208;two&#8208;level system behavior in the observed band intensity. Since the model does not depend on the molecular specification of TMA&#8211;H  +  , the strong coupling we observed here is an intrinsic property associated with proton motions in a wide range of molecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>A mixed heavier Si=Ge analogue of a vinyl anion</title>
      <dc:description>The versatile reactivities of disilenides and digermenide, heavier analogues of vinyl anions, have significantly expanded the pool of silicon and germanium compounds with various unexpected structural motifs in the past two decades.

      <title>Polyurethanes from Direct Organocatalytic Copolymerization of p&#8208;Tosyl Isocyanate with Epoxides</title>
      <dc:description>The direct copolymerization of  p  &#8208;tosyl isocyanate (TSI) with epoxides, initiated by onium salts in the presence of trialkylborane, to produce polyurethanes is reported. The rate of copolymerization and the (regio)selectivity were investigated in relation to the trialkylborane and initiator used. Under optimized conditions such copolymerizations have been successfully performed for a wide range of epoxides, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1&#8208;octene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, and allyl glycidyl ether. These copolymerizations afford a new category of polyurethanes, clear of side products such as cyclic oxazolidinone, isocyanurate, and poly(isocyanate) linkages. The experimental conditions used in this work are compatible with those for the organocatalytic (co)polymerization of other oxygenated monomers and CO  2  , holding the potential for their terpolymerization with  p  &#8208;tosyl isocyanate and the development of new materials with unprecedented properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular Carboaminations via C&#8210;H Functionalizations</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent cyclopentadienyl cobalt catalysis is a versatile tool for sustainable C&#8211;H bond functionalization. To harness the full potential of this strategy, stereoselectivity control of these processes is necessary. Herein, we report highly enantioselective intermolecular carboaminations of alkenes through C&#8211;H activation of  N  &#8208;phenoxyamides catalyzed by Co  III  &#8208;complexes equipped with chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp  x  ) ligands. The method converts widely available acrylates as well as bicyclic olefins into attractive enantioenriched isotyrosine derivatives as well as elaborated amino&#8208;substituted bicyclic scaffolds under very mild conditions. The outlined reactivity is unique to the Cp  x  Co  III  complexes and is complementary to the one corresponding to 4d&#8208; and 5d&#8208; precious metal catalysts.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High&#8208;valent cyclopentadienyl cobalt catalysis is a versatile tool for sustainable C&#8211;H bond functionalization. To harness the full potential of this strategy, stereoselectivity control of these processes is necessary. Herein, we report highly enantioselective intermolecular carboaminations of alkenes through C&#8211;H activation of  N  &#8208;phenoxyamides catalyzed by Co  III  &#8208;complexes equipped with chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp  x  ) ligands. The method converts widely available acrylates as well as bicyclic olefins into attractive enantioenriched isotyrosine derivatives as well as elaborated amino&#8208;substituted bicyclic scaffolds under very mild conditions. The outlined reactivity is unique to the Cp  x  Co  III  complexes and is complementary to the one corresponding to 4d&#8208; and 5d&#8208; precious metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Salt to Taste: The Critical Roles Played by Inorganic Salts in Organozinc Formation and in the Negishi Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The first cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc nucleophiles with aryl halides was reported in 1977 by Negishi. Unknown to all at the time was the importance of salt additives that were often present as a byproduct from the organozinc preparation. For decades, these salt additives were overlooked until 2006 when it was discovered that two different, yet effective methods for preparing organozinc solutions (i.e. one with salt and one without) provided drastically different results. Since this finding, the exact role of salt additives in cross&#8208;coupling has been debated in the catalysis community. In this review we highlight all the major discoveries regarding the influence of salt additives on the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in the Negishi reaction. These effects include solubilizing key intermediates, the formation of higher order zincates, product inhibition, catalyst protection and solvent effects.</dc:description>

      <title>H2&#8208;free Re&#8208;based catalytic dehydroxylation of aldaric acid to muconic and adipic acid esters</title>
      <dc:description>Being one of the most demanded dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid can be directly produced from renewable sources. Hexoses from (hemi)cellulose are oxidized to aldaric acids and subsequently catalytically dehydroxylated. Hitherto performed homogeneously, we present the first heterogeneous catalytic process for converting an aldaric acid into muconic and adipic acid. The contribution of leached Re from the solid pre&#8208;reduced catalyst was also investigated with hot&#8208;filtration test and found to be inactive for dehydroxylation. Corrosive or hazardous (HBr/H  2  ) reagents are eschewed in lieu of simple alcohols and solid Re/C catalysts in an inert atmosphere. At 120 &#176;C, the carboxylic groups are protected by esterification, which prevents lactonisation in the absence of water or acidic sites. Dehydroxylation and partial hydrogenation yield monohexenoates (93%). For complete hydrogenation to adipate, a 16% higher activation barrier necessitates higher temperatures. The mechanism of selective removal of adjacent OH* groups on Re(0001) and the role of methanol in hydrogen transfer are elucidated by DFT calculations as well as XPS, chemisorption and HR&#8208;TEM experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of Self&#8208;Assembling Small Molecules as Vaccine Adjuvants</title>
      <dc:description>Immune potentiators, termed adjuvant, trigger early innate immune responses to ensure the generation of robust and long&#8208;lasting adaptive immune responses of vaccines. Here we present study that takes advantage of a self&#8208;assembling small molecule library for the development of a novel vaccine adjuvant. Cell&#8208;based screening of the library and subsequent structural optimization led to the discovery of a simple, chemically tractable deoxycholate derivative (molecule  6  , also named cholicamide) whose well&#8208;defined nano&#8208;assembly potently elicits innate immune responses in macrophages and dendritic cells. Functional and mechanistic analyses indicate that the virus&#8208;like assembly is engulfed inside cells and stimulates the innate immune response through toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal TLR that detects single&#8208;stranded viral RNA. As an influenza vaccine adjuvant in mice, molecule  6  was as potent as Alum, a clinically used adjuvant. The studies described here paves the way for a new approach to discovering and designing self&#8208;assembling small&#8208;molecule adjuvants against pathogens, including emerging viruses.</dc:description>

Functional and mechanistic analyses indicate that the virus&#8208;like assembly is engulfed inside cells and stimulates the innate immune response through toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7), an endosomal TLR that detects single&#8208;stranded viral RNA. As an influenza vaccine adjuvant in mice, molecule  6  was as potent as Alum, a clinically used adjuvant. The studies described here paves the way for a new approach to discovering and designing self&#8208;assembling small&#8208;molecule adjuvants against pathogens, including emerging viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Self&#8208;Degradable Supramolecular Photosensitizer with High Photodynamic Therapeutic Efficiency and Improved Safety</title>
      <dc:description>Concerning that the residues of photosensitizers (PS) may cause serious side effects under light, it is of great significant to timely &#8216;switch off&#8217; PS after photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we proposed a supramolecular strategy to regulate the activity of PS, fabricating a supramolecular PS with improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency and accelerated self&#8208;degradation ability. During PDT treatment, the supramolecular PS exhibited good therapeutic efficiency as well as reduced dark toxicity. Moreover, the supramolecular PS could be degraded by ROS generated by itself and lose its PDT activities once PDT treatment finished. In this way, the side effects of PDT can be reduced without sacrificing the therapeutic efficiency. This work provides a novel strategy for smarter PDT beacon to further improve the safety of PDT treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Photodriven Disproportionation of Nitrogen and Its Change to Reductive Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is an essential process for sustaining life. Tremendous efforts have been made on the photodriven fixation of nitrogen into ammonia. However, the disproportionation of dinitrogen to ammonia and nitrate under ambient conditions has yet remained a grand challenge. In this work, the photodriven disproportionation of nitrogen is realized in water under visible light and ambient conditions using Fe&#8208;doped TiO  2  microspheres. The oxygen vacancies associated with the Fe dopants activate chemisorbed N  2  molecules, which can then be fixed into NH  3  with H  2  O  2  as the oxidation product. The generated H  2  O  2  thereafter oxidizes NH  3  into nitrate. This disproportionation reaction can be turned to the reductive one by loading plasmonic Au nanoparticles in the doped TiO  2  microspheres. The generated H  2  O  2  can be effectively decomposed by the Au nanoparticles, resulting in the transformation of the disproportionation reaction to the completely reductive nitrogen photofixation.</dc:description>
