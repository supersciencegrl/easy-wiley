         <title>Tuning Pore Polarization to Boost Ethane/Ethylene Separation Performance in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) show great potential in energy&#8208;saving C2H6/C2H4 separation, but there are few examples of one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 because it is still difficult to achieve the reverse&#8208;order adsorption of C2H6 and C2H4. In this work, we boost the C2H6/C2H4 separation performance in two graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like HOFs by tuning pore polarization. Upon heating, an in situ solid phase transformation can be observed from HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (DMA = dimethylamine cation) to HOF&#8208;NBDA, accompanied with transformation of the electronegative skeleton into neutral one. As a result, the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA has become nonpolar, which is beneficial to selectively adsorbing C2H6. The difference in the capacities for C2H6 and C2H4 is 23.4 cm3&#8729;g&#8208;1 for HOF&#8208;NBDA, and the C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio is 136%, which are much higher than those for HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.0 cm3&#8729;g&#8208;1 and 108% respectively). Practical breakthrough experiments demonstrate HOF&#8208;NBDA could produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) mixture with a high productivity of 29.2 L&#8729;kg&#8208;1 at 298 K, which is about five times as high as HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.4 L&#8729;kg&#8208;1). In addition, in situ breakthrough experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA is beneficial to preferentially capture C2H6 and thus boosts selective separation of C2H6/C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorothioated DNA Engineered Liposomes as a General Platform for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Cell&#8208;Specific Intracellular Delivery and Genome&#8208;Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular protein delivery is highly desirable for protein drug&#8208;based cell therapy. Established technologies suffer from poor cell&#8208;specific cytosolic protein delivery, which hampers the targeting therapy of specific cell populations. Fusogenic liposome system enables cytosolic delivery, but its ability of cell&#8208;specific and controllable delivery is quite limited. Inspired by the kinetics of viral fusion, we designed a phosphorothioated DNA coatings&#8208;modified fusogenic liposome to mimic the function of viral hemagglutinin. The macromolecular fusion machine docks cargo&#8208;loaded liposomes at the membrane of target cells, triggers membrane fusion upon pH or UV light stimuli, and facilitates cytosolic protein delivery. Our results showed efficient cell&#8208;targeted delivery of proteins of various sizes and charges, indicating the phosphorothioated DNA plug&#8208;in unit on liposomes could be a general strategy for spatial&#8208;temporally controllable protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Ring Contraction and Expansion Reaction: Electrosynthesis of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Fulleroids and Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous electrochemical ring contraction and expansion reactions remain unexplored to date. Herein, the reductive electrosynthesis of heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids from fullerotetrahydropyridazines and electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen has been achieved with concurrent ring contraction and ring expansion. When trifluoroacetic acid and alkyl bromides are employed as electrophiles, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,2,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively formed. In contrast, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,4,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively produced as two separable stereoisomers if phthaloyl chloride is used as the electrophile. The reaction proceeds through multiple steps of electroreduction, heterocycle ring&#8208;opening, oxygen oxidation, heterocycle contraction, fullerene cage expansion, and nucleophilic addition. The structures of these fulleroids have been determined by spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The observed high regioselectivities have been rationalized by theoretical calculations.&#160;&#160;Representative fulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells as the third component and exhibit good performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Molecule Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Processed Using Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) based on A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were mostly fabricated by toxic halogenated solvent processing, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the non&#8208;halogenated solvent processed OSCs is mainly restricted by the excessive aggregation of the SMAs. To address this issue, we developed two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) with the &#960;&#8208;spacer linking on the inner carbon (EV&#8208;i) or out carbon (EV&#8208;o) of benzene end group of the SMA with longer alkyl side chains (ECOD) for the capability of non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processing. Interestingly, EV&#8208;i possesses a twisted molecular structure but enhanced conjugation, while EV&#8208;o shows a better planar molecular structure but weakened conjugation. The OSC with EV&#8208;i as acceptor processed by the non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) demonstrated a higher PCE of 18.27% than that of the devices based on the acceptor of ECOD (16.40%) or EV&#8208;o (2.50%). 18.27% is one of the highest PCEs among the OSCs fabricated from non&#8208;halogenated solvents so far, benefitted from the suitable twisted structure, stronger absorbance and high charge carrier mobility of EV&#8208;i. The results indicate that the GMAs with suitable linking site would be the excellent candidates for fabricating high performance OSCs processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>A Time&#8208;Resolved FRET Assay Identifies a Small Molecule that Inhibits the Essential Bacterial Cell Wall Polymerase FtsW</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival. To form the cell wall, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) polymerize Lipid II to make glycan strands and then those strands are crosslinked by transpeptidases (TPs). Recently, the SEDS (for shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins were identified as a new class of PGTs. The SEDS protein FtsW, which produces septal peptidoglycan during cell division, is an attractive target for novel antibiotics because it is essential in virtually all bacteria. Here, we developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay to monitor PGT activity and screened a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a compound that inhibits S. aureus FtsW in vitro. Using a non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid II derivative, we showed that this compound competes with Lipid II for binding to FtsW. The assays described here will be useful for discovering and characterizing other PGT inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Fluorescent NETosis Reporter for the Prognosis Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro&#8208;tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer im&#8208;munotherapy. Non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains chal&#8208;lenging. Herein, we report a tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter 1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the pres&#8208;ence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker&#8208;specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem&#8208;locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single&#8208;locked reporters fail to do so. The near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intra&#8208;tumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immu&#8208;notherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem&#8208;locked probe design.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro-tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer im-munotherapy. Non-invasive real-time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains chal-lenging. Herein, we report a tandem-locked NETosis Reporter 1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the pres-ence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker-specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem-locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single-locked reporters fail to do so. The near-infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intra-tumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near-infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immu-notherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem-locked probe design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CoN1O2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation and Selective Cobalt(IV)=O Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo (HVMO) are powerful non&#8208;radical reactive species that enhance advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) due to their long half&#8208;lives and high selectivity towards recalcitrant water pollutants with electron&#8208;donating groups.&#160; However, high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo (CoIV=O) generation is challenging in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs because the high 3d&#8208;orbital occupancy of cobalt would disfavor its binding with a terminal oxygen ligand. Herein, we propose a strategy to construct isolated Co sites with unique N1O2 coordination on Mn3O4 surface. The asymmetric N1O2 configuration is able to accept electrons from Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in significant electronic delocalization at Co sites for the promoted PMS adsorption, dissociation and subsequent generation of CoIV=O species. CoN1O2/Mn3O4 exhibits high intrinsic activity in PMS activation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, highly outperforming its counterpart with CoO3 configuration, carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with CoN4 configuration, and commercial cobalt oxides. CoIV=O species effectively oxidize the target contaminants via oxygen atom transfer to produce low&#8208;toxicity intermediates. These findings could advance mechanistic understanding of PMS activation at the molecular level and guide the rational design of efficient environmental catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstruction of Solid Electrolyte Interphase with SrI2 Reactivates Dead Li for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dead Li in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery is suppressed effectively through synergistic mechanisms. With SrI2 incorporation, reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction reactivates dead Li; electronic insulation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) surface with SrF2 and LiF prevents electrolyte decomposition; the inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI demonstrates high ionic conduction (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and enables efficient Li+ transfer and Li deposition inside the SEI.







Abstract
Without excess Li, anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly&#8208;safe and cost&#8208;effective Li&#8208;metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life puzzles conventional AFLMBs due to anodic dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li+ transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI2 is introduced into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric SEI surface with SrF2 and LiF to prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly ionic conductive (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI to enable efficient Li+ transfer inside. With the SrI2&#8208;modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Diazabicyclic Electroactive Ionenes for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazabicyclic electroactive ionenes with high density of interfacial dipoles are developed as interlayers in organic solar cells. Devices containing the optimal electroactive ionene interlayer give efficiency up to 18.43&#8201;% and excellent operational stability with exceptional interlayer thickness tolerance over 100&#8197;nm, correlating well with its superior optoelectronic and morphological characters, representing the best record reported so far.







Abstract
Electroactive ionenes combining caged&#8208;shaped diazabicyclic cations and aromatic diimides were developed as interlayers in organic solar cells (OSCs). These ionenes reduce the work&#8208;function of air&#8208;stable metal electrodes (e.g., Ag, Cu and Au) by generating strong interfacial dipoles, and their optoelectronic and morphological characters can be modulated by aromatic diimides, leading to high conductivity and good compatibility with active layers. The optimal ionene exhibits superior charge&#8208;transport, desirable crystallinity, and weak visible&#8208;absorption, boosting the efficiency of benchmark PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSCs up to 17.44&#8201;%. The corresponding normal devices show excellent stability at maximum power point test under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h. Replacing Y6 with L8&#8208;BO promotes the efficiency to 18.43&#8201;%, one of the highest in binary OSCs. Notably, high efficiencies &gt;16&#8201;% are maintained as the interlayer thickness increasing to 105&#8197;nm, the best result with interlayer&#8208;thickness over 100&#8197;nm.

Abstract
A novel, selective and high&#8208;yielding palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative arylation of a variety of weakly acidic (pKa 25&#8211;35 in DMSO) benzylic and heterobenzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with aryl bromides has been achieved. This system is applicable to a range of pro&#8208;nucleophiles for access to sterically and electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones, which are ubiquitous substructures in biologically active compounds. The Josiphos SL&#8208;J001&#8208;1&#8208;based palladium catalyst was identified as the most efficient and selective, enabling carbonylative arylation with aryl bromides under 1&#8197;atm CO to provide the ketone products without the formation of direct coupling byproducts. Additionally, (Josiphos)Pd(CO)2 was identified as the catalyst resting state. A kinetic study suggests that the oxidative addition of aryl bromides is the turnover&#8208;limiting step. Key catalytic intermediates were also isolated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled L&#8211;DNA Linkers for Rapid Construction of Multi&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates Library</title>

A modular platform for rapid construction of multi&#8208;specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The MADC platform offers the combinatorial flexibility to screen for optimal target and payload combinations, while having the potential of becoming viable therapeutic agents themselves.







Abstract
One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8211;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8211;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors.

     alt="Self-Assembled L&#8211;DNA Linkers for Rapid Construction of Multi-Specific Antibody-Drug Conjugates Library"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular platform for rapid construction of multi-specific Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The MADC platform offers the combinatorial flexibility to screen for optimal target and payload combinations, while having the potential of becoming viable therapeutic agents themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self-assembled left-handed DNA (L&#8211;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single-domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi-specific targeting, multi-specific payloads, and exact drug-antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8211;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8211;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi-specificity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Fueled Autonomous Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reentrant phase transitions (sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol) are known to exist in natural and artificial chemical systems. In the past decade, chemical fuels have been used to tune reentrant phase transitions. Here a chemically fueled double reentrant phase transition is presented, where two distinct hydrogels (i.e. from aldehyde&#8208; and imine&#8208;based gelators) form transiently and in sequential order. This results in an autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transition.







Abstract
Complex non&#8208;equilibrium phase behaviors are a hallmark of natural self&#8208;assembling systems. Here we show how intricate phase transitions can be achieved through a chemically fueled reaction cycle to yield autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transitions. A relay of chemical transformations based on thiazinane metathesis leads to two consecutive transient gelations in a closed system. Within seconds of fuel addition to deactivated thiazinane monomers, an imine&#8208;based hydrogel forms that consists of fibrillar microspheres. This gel quickly loses its mechanical strength and forms a solution, from which a second aldehyde&#8208;based gel nucleates and remains stable for over one day. Overall, our reaction cycle gives rise to two consecutive re&#8208;entrant phase transitions without any experimental intervention.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Arylation of Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of chemoselective, metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry.







Abstract
A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd&#8208;DalPhos pre&#8208;catalyst C2 enabled particularly challenging O&#8208;arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective N&#8208;arylation was observed in substrates featuring less&#8208;hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.

         <title>A Coordination Polymer of Vaska's Complex as a Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Reductive Formation of Enamines from Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material is synthesized using a tetratopic phosphine linker and Vaska's complex. This crystalline, IrI&#8208;containing material behaves similarly to Vaska's complex, binding dioxygen reversibly and can also be used as a recyclable, heterogeneous catalyst for the reductive formation of enamines from amides.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LVMOFs) and related materials have gained interest due to their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. However, of the few LVMOFs that have been reported, none have shown catalytic activity. Herein, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material constructed from phosphine linkers and IrI nodes is reported. This material is effectively a crystalline, insoluble analogue of Vaska's complex. As such, the material reversibly binds O2 and catalyzes the reductive formation of enamines from amides.

         <title>Passive Gate&#8208;Tunable Kinetic Photovoltage along Semiconductor&#8208;Water Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching on/off the kinetic photovoltage, an in&#8208;plane voltage in the semiconductor driven by the moving boundaries of electrical double layer between the irradiated and dark regions, is achieved by applying a bias across the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The study extends the principle of the solid&#8208;state field effect transistor to the solid&#8211;liquid system and may lead to novel design concepts for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Moving boundaries of electric double layer at solid&#8211;liquid interface enables unprecedented persistent energy conversion and provokes a kinetic photovoltaic effect by moving an illumination region along the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. Here, we report a transistor&#8208;inspired gate modulation of kinetic photovoltage by applying a bias at the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. The kinetic photovoltage of both p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type silicon samples can be facilely switched on/off, stemming from the electrical&#8208;field&#8208;modulated surface band bending. In contrast to the function of solid&#8208;state transistors relying on external sources, passive gate modulation of the kinetic photovoltage is achieved simply by introducing a counter electrode with materials of desired electrochemical potential. This architecture provides the ability to modulate the kinetic photovoltage over three orders of magnitude and opens up a new way for self&#8208;powered optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers successfully implemented the key features of the natural enzyme CO dehydrogenase in an iron porphyrin architecture and designed a catalyst that allowed facile and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 products is challenging, as the thermodynamic reduction potentials for the different n&#8201;e&#8722;/n&#8201;H+ reductions of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers have taken inspiration from the active site of nickel CO dehydrogenase (Ni&#8208;CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by a urea moiety. These complexes show fast and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and the results suggest a Ni&#8208;CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metals binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilizes the reduced species by forming a bridged complex, facilitating the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>A Traceless Chiral Shift Reagent Based on Nonbonding Interactions with Single&#8208;Handed Helical Poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifiable separation of the NMR signals of enantiomers of a broad range of chiral compounds including ethers, ketones, esters, haloalkanes, and alkanes, is possible by using a single&#8208;handed helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing simple chiral alkoxymethyl side chains as a chiral shift reagent. The short spin&#8208;spin relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold enables the proton signals of the chiral shift reagent to be eliminated from the spectra.







Abstract
A single&#8208;handed poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) (PQX) has been found to serve as a new type of chiral shift reagent (CSR) for determining the enantiomeric ratio by NMR spectroscopy. Even though there is no specific binding site in the PQX, its nonbonding interaction with chiral analytes leads to a significant shift of the NMR chemical shift, allowing quantification of the enantiomeric ratio. The new type of CSR has the advantages of a wide scope of analytes including ethers, haloalkanes, and alkanes, easy tunability of the degree of chemical shifts by measurement temperature, and erasability of proton signals of CSR because of the short spin&#8208;spin (T2) relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold.

Divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via a rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The aza&#8208;adamantane backbone of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B was furnished via a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization, and the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone was assembled through an N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization from the same intermediate.







Abstract
The daphnezomine A&#8208;type subfamily of Daphniphyllum alkaloids structurally features a unique aza&#8208;adamantane core skeleton and anticipates efficient strategies for completing their syntheses to thoroughly investigate their biological activities. Herein, divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The present work features a Ti&#8208;mediated radical cyclization to establish the azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system, an intramolecular Heck reaction to install the bridgehead all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization to furnish the aza&#8208;adamantane backbone, and an NIS&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization to assemble the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone.

         <title>An Artificial In Vitro Metabolism to Angiopterlactone B Inspired by Traditional Retrosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades, combining the selectivity of biological systems with the elegance of chemical synthesis, offer an exceptional opportunity for the preparation of complex molecular structures. By integrating native and abiotic enzyme modules in a metabolism&#8208;like network, a five&#8208;enzyme cascade coupled with a carbonate&#8208;induced dimerization step yielded the tricyclic natural product angiopterlactone B in a two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Nature's way to construct highly complex molecular entities as part of biosynthetic pathways is unmatched by any chemical synthesis. Yet, relying on a cascade of native enzymatic transformations to achieve a certain target structure, biosynthesis is also significantly limited in its scope. In this study, non&#8208;natural biocatalytic modules, a peroxidase&#8208;mediated Achmatowicz rearrangement and a dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed borrowing&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;type isomerization were successfully incorporated into an artificial metabolism, combining the benefits of traditional retrosynthesis with the elegance and efficacy of biosynthetic networks. In a highly streamlined process, the total synthesis of tricyclic angiopterlactone B was achieved in two steps operating entirely in an aqueous environment while relying mainly on enzymes as key reaction mediators.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In their Research Article (e202301351), Guozhi Xiao and co&#8208;workers accomplished the first synthesis of a tridecasaccharide motif from&#160;Bacteroides vulgatus lipopolysaccharides by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl&#160;ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.

         <title>Low Bandgap 2D Perovskite Single Crystal with Anomalous&#8208;large Charges/ions Collection Ratio for Ultra&#8208;sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the strategy of using Cu2+ ions cross&#8208;linking the layers of 2D perovskite can not only reduce the perovskite band gap, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and suppress the ions migration effectively. The [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.69&#215;1018&#177;4.7&#8201;%&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s, and exhibit an excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances.







Abstract
The low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention due to their improved moisture stability, reduced defects, and suppressed ions migration in many optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, X&#8208;ray detectors, and so on. However, they are still limited by their large band gap and short charge carriers&#8217; diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of metal ions into organic interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite by cross&#8208;linking the copper paddle&#8208;wheel cluster&#8208;based lead bromide ([Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4) perovskite single crystals with coordination bonds can not only significantly reduce the perovskite band gap to 0.96&#8197;eV to boost the X&#8208;ray induced charge carriers, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and blocking the ions motion paths. The [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 single&#8208;crystal device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.69&#215;1018&#177;4.7&#8201;%&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s, and exhibit a large sensitivity of 1.14&#215;105&#177;7%&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 56&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 under 120&#8197;keV X&#8208;rays irradiation. In addition, [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 single&#8208;crystal detector exposed to the air without any encapsulation shows excellent X&#8208;ray imaging capability with long&#8208;term operational stability without any attenuation of 120&#8197;days.

         <title>Blended Conjugated Host and Unconjugated Dopant Polymers Towards N&#8208;type All&#8208;Polymer Conductors and High&#8208;ZT Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new n&#8208;type polymer PDPIN is synthesized and thermoelectric performance of N&#8208;DMBI, TABF and polymer PSpF&#8208;doped PDPIN are explored. All&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics of PDPIN:PSpF present high electrical conductivity of 78.1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, power factor of 163&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 and ZT of 0.53, suggesting the impressive superiority of PDPIN:PSpF systems in low thermal conductivity and high ZT&#8208;thermoelectrics.







Abstract
N&#8208;Type thermoelectrics typically consist of small molecule dopant+polymer host. Only a few polymer dopant+polymer host systems have been reported, and these have lower thermoelectric parameters. N&#8208;type polymers with high crystallinity and order are generally used for high&#8208;conductivity (
) organic conductors. Few n&#8208;type polymers with only short&#8208;range lamellar stacking for high&#8208;conductivity materials have been reported. Here, we describe an n&#8208;type short&#8208;range lamellar&#8208;stacked all&#8208;polymer thermoelectric system with highest 
 of 78&#8197;S&#8722;1, power factor (PF) of 163&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and maximum Figure of merit (ZT) of 0.53 at room temperature with a dopant/host ratio of 75&#8197;wt%. The minor effect of polymer dopant on the molecular arrangement of conjugated polymer PDPIN at high ratios, high doping capability, high Seebeck coefficient (S) absolute values relative to 
, and atypical decreased thermal conductivity (
) with increased doping ratio contribute to the promising performance.

         <title>Non&#8208;symmetric Half&#8208;Fused B&#8592;N Coordinated Diketopyrrolopyrrole Building Block for n&#8208;type Semiconducting Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
A new type of building block, half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N coordinated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), is developed for n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers towards flexible OFETs with reliability.







Abstract
The development of conjugated polymers with high semiconducting performance and high reliability is of great significance for flexible electronics. Herein, we developed a new type of electron&#8208;accepting building block; i.e., non&#8208;symmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N coordinated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) (HBNDPP), for amorphous conjugated polymers toward flexible electronics. The rigid B&#8592;N fusion part of HBNDPP endows the resulting polymers with decent electron transport, while its non&#8208;symmetric structure causes the polymer to exhibit multiple conformation isomers with flat torsional potential energies. Thus, it gets packed in an amorphous manner in solid state, ensuring good resistance to bending strain. Combined with hardness and softness, the flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices exhibit n&#8208;type charge properties with decent mobility, good bending resistance, and good ambient stability. The preliminary study makes this building block a potential candidate for future design of conjugated materials for flexible electronic devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic activity can be enhanced up to three times by confining the catalyst within a compact single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticle environment, while retaining homocatalytic reaction conditions.







Abstract
We introduce a single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) system capable of catalyzing the photooxidation of nonpolar alkenes up to three times more efficiently than an equivalent small&#8208;molecule photosensitizer at an identical concentration. Specifically, we construct a polymer chain constituted of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate which we compact via multifunctional thiol&#8208;epoxide ligation and functionalize with Rose Bengal (RB) in a one pot reaction, affording SCNPs with a hydrophilic shell and hydrophobic photocatalytic regions. Photooxidation of the internal alkene in oleic acid proceeds under green light. RB confined within the SCNP is three times more effective for nonpolar alkenes than free RB in solution, which we hypothesize is due to the spatial proximity of the photosensitizing units to the substrate in the hydrophobic region. Our approach demonstrates that SCNP based catalysts can afford enhanced photocatalysis via confinement effects in a homogeneous reaction environment.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Molecular Design: A Route to High&#8208;Performance Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state nanomorphology that enables aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is shown to be compatible with the ion redistribution that defines the operation of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), and appropriately designed AIE&#8208;LECs are reported to deliver fast&#8208;to&#8208;turn and efficient emission at low voltage.







Abstract
The emission efficiency of organic semiconductors (OSCs) often suffers from aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). An elegant solution is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which constitutes the design of the OSC so that its morphology inhibits quenching &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and non&#8208;radiative motional deactivation. The light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) can be sustainably fabricated, but its function depends on motion of bulky ions in proximity of the OSC. It is therefore questionable whether the AIE morphology can be retained during LEC operation. Here, we synthesize two structurally similar OSCs, which are distinguished by that 1 features ACQ while 2 delivers AIE. Interestingly, we find that the AIE&#8208;LEC significantly outperforms the ACQ&#8208;LEC. We rationalize our finding by showing that the AIE morphology remains intact during LEC operation, and that it can feature appropriately sized free&#8208;volume voids for facile ion transport and suppressed non&#8208;radiative excitonic deactivation.

Abstract
The design of high&#8208;affinity synthetic host&#8211;guest complexes is of paramount importance because they are key elements in constructing unprecedented supramolecular assemblies, functional materials, molecular probes, artificial signal transduction events, and interfaces with the biological world. The present review article collects recent achievements in the design of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with outstanding stabilities, i.e., exceeding 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The relationships between the measured thermodynamic constants and the structural parameters of the interacting species are analyzed. The design features of high&#8208;affinity hosts are discussed in light of their binding properties. Different solvents and different types of noncovalent interactions are considered for the stabilization of the complexes. Finally, some hints are provided for the design of future synthetic receptors displaying high affinity and selectivity.

         <title>Electrically Conductive &#960;&#8208;Intercalated Graphitic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Alternate &#960;&#8208;Donor/Acceptor Stacks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy afforded the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated 2D graphitic metal&#8211;organic framework (iGMOF) containing alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor stacks of metal&#8208;coordinated &#960;&#8208;donor ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated planar &#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules, which displayed an impressive bulk electrical conductivity (&#8776;30&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1) thanks to its simultaneous in&#8208;plane through&#8208;bond and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane through &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor stacks charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional graphitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through&#8208;bond in&#8208;plane charge transport, however, less efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conduction across the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom&#8208;up method the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built&#8208;in alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor (&#960;&#8208;D/A) stacks of CuII&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated &#960;&#8208;acidic hexacyano&#8208;triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport while the hexagonal Cu3(HATP)2 scaffold maintained in&#8208;plane conduction. As a result, iGMOF1 attained an order of magnitude higher bulk electrical conductivity and much smaller activation energy than Cu3(HATP)2 (&#963;=25 vs. 2&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1, Ea=36 vs. 65&#8197;meV), demostrating that simultaneous in&#8208;plane (through&#8208;bond) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (through &#960;D/A stacks) charge transport can generate higher electrical conductivity in novel iGMOFs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional graphitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through-bond in-plane charge transport, however, less efficient out-of-plane conduction across the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom-up method the first &#960;-intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built-in alternate &#960;-donor/acceptor (&#960;-D/A) stacks of Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated electron-rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non-coordinatively intercalated &#960;-acidic hexacyano-triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out-of-plane charge transport while the hexagonal Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HATP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scaffold maintained in-plane conduction.

         <title>Diphosphoryl&#8208;functionalized Polyoxometalates: Structurally and Electronically Tunable Hybrid Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid diphosphoryl Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) is described. The covalent tethering of diphosphoryl compounds to the inorganic cluster gives redox&#8208;active materials with enhanced hydrolytic stability compared to the corresponding phosphonate analogues. These readily modifiable precursors provide a platform for structural and electronic modulation of the POM, enabling the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson POMs.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POM) containing a diphosphoryl group (P2O6X) of the general formula [P2W17O57(P2O6X)]6&#8722; (X=O, NH, or CR1R2). Modifying the bridging unit X was found to impact the redox potentials of the POM. The ease with which a range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized diphosphonic acids (X=CR1R2) can be prepared provides possibilities to access diverse functionalized hybrid POMs. Compared to existing phosphonate hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson POMs, diphosphoryl&#8208;substituted POMs offer a wider tunable redox window and enhanced hydrolytic stability. This study provides a basis for the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation hybrid Wells&#8211;Dawson POMs.

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by 760 nm NIR light via single&#8208;photon pathway is reported by Xuezhao Li, Wen Sun, et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218768). The photocage was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers, forming nanoparticles via self&#8208;assembly, which release the ruthenium complex&#8208;based photocages to inhibit tumor proliferation in vivo upon exposure to NIR light.

         <title>Time&#8208;dependent Phosphorescence Color of Carbon Dots in Binary Salt Matrices through Activations by Structural Confinement and Defects for Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color of carbon dots in binary salt matrices through activations by structural confinement and defects. The resulting material can be used for multi&#8208;level dynamic phosphorescence color 3D coding to achieve information encryption.







Abstract
The emergence of time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials has taken information encryption to high&#8208;security levels. However, due to the only path of exciton transfer, it is almost impossible to obtain TDPC for chromophores with a single emission center. Theoretically, in inorganic&#8208;organic composites, the exciton transfer of organic chromophores depends on the inorganic structure. Here, we assign two structural effects to inorganic NaCl by metal (Mg2+ or Ca2+ or Ba2+) doping, which triggers the TDPC performance of carbon dots (CDs) with a single emission center. The resulting material is used for multi&#8208;level dynamic phosphorescence color 3D coding to achieve information encryption. The structural confinement activates the green phosphorescence of CDs; while the structural defect activates tunneling&#8208;related yellow phosphorescence. Such simply doped inorganic matrices can be synthesized using the periodic table of metal cations, endowing chromophores with tremendous control over TDPC properties. This demonstration extends the design view of dynamic luminescent materials.

         <title>Small Data Can Play a Big Role in Chemical Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the paucity of reliable datasets, chemical discovery is enriched by machine learning techniques. Recent advances in data infrastructure management now prioritize high&#8208;quality data, which enable creative reinterpretation of information across contexts and disciplines.

The chemistry community is currently witnessing a surge of scientific discoveries in organic chemistry supported by machine learning (ML) techniques. Whereas many of these techniques were developed for big data applications, the nature of experimental organic chemistry often confines practitioners to small datasets. Herein, we touch upon the limitations associated with small data in ML and emphasize the impact of bias and variance on constructing reliable predictive models. We aim to raise awareness to these possible pitfalls, and thus, provide an introductory guideline for good practice. Ultimately, we stress the great value associated with statistical analysis of small data, which can be further boosted by adopting a holistic data&#8208;centric approach in chemistry.

         <title>Strong, Supertough and Self&#8208;Healing Biomimetic Layered Nanocomposites Enabled by Reversible Interfacial Polymer Chain Sliding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultratough layered nanocomposite is prepared by constructing reversible interfacial chain sliding between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength, supertoughness, ultrahigh stretchability and self&#8208;healing ability, which far surpass most reported synthetic and natural laminate materials.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress in ultrastrong mechanical laminate materials, the simultaneous achievement of toughness, stretchability and self&#8208;healing properties in biomimetic layered nanocomposites remains a great challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of their hard essences and lack of effective stress transfer at the organic&#8208;inorganic fragile boundary. Here, an ultratough nanocomposite laminate is prepared by constructing chain&#8208;sliding cross&#8208;linking at the interface between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. Unlike traditional supramolecular bonding toughening with limited sliding spacing, our strategy enables interfacial molecular chains reversible slippage when the inorganic nanosheets bear stretching force, providing sufficient interlayer spatial distance for relative sliding to dissipate more energy. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength (22.33&#8197;MPa), supertoughness (219.08&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultrahigh stretchability (&gt;1900&#8201;%) and self&#8208;healing ability (99.7&#8201;%), which far surpass most of reported synthetic and natural laminate materials. Moreover, the fabricated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electronic skin shows excellent flexibility, sensitivity and healability for human physiological signals monitoring. This strategy breaks through the challenge that traditional layered nanocomposites are intrinsically stiff and opens up the functional application of layered nanocomposites in flexible devices.

         <title>Cationic Rhodium(I) Tetrafluoroborate Catalyzed Intramolecular Carbofluorination of Alkenes via Acyl Fluoride C&#8722;F Bond Activation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;F bond of acyl fluorides can be cleaved and added across tethered alkenes in the presence of a cationic rhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate catalyst. This 1,2&#8208;carbofluorination reaction offers a powerful method for the synthesis of tertiary alkyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the concerted action of a rhodium cation and a tetrafluoroborate anion is key for the success of this catalytic cleavage and formation of C&#8722;F bonds.

         <title>An Iridium/Aluminum Cooperative Strategy for the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium/aluminum cooperative catalytic system that enables the &#946;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines and lactams is described. An enantioselective variant using binaphthol&#8208;derived chiral aluminum catalysts to forge C&#8722;B bonds with high levels of stereocontrol has also been developed.







Abstract
Despite the widespread success in the functionalization of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds, the deliberate functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a highly site&#8208; and stereoselective manner remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, we report an iridium/aluminum cooperative catalytic system that enables the &#946;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines and lactams. Furthermore, we have accomplished an enantioselective variant using binaphthol&#8208;derived chiral aluminum catalysts to forge C&#8722;B bonds with high levels of stereocontrol. Computational studies suggest that the formation of a Lewis pair with the substrates is crucial to lower the energy of the transition state for the rate&#8208;determining reductive elimination step.

         <title>Synergizing Electron and Heat Flows in Photocatalyst for Direct Conversion of Captured CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary hybrid photocatalyst architecture is developed to convert amine&#8208;captured CO2 to syngas with solar energy. The carbon nanotube plays key roles in transferring photoexcited electrons from the quantum dot to the molecular catalyst and in generating local heat from light irradiation for carbamate activation.







Abstract
We report a ternary hybrid photocatalyst architecture with tailored interfaces that boost the utilization of solar energy for photochemical CO2 reduction by synergizing electron and heat flows in the photocatalyst. The photocatalyst comprises cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecules assembled on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are decorated with nearly monodispersed cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs). The CdS QDs absorb visible light and generate electron&#8208;hole pairs. The CNTs rapidly transfer the photogenerated electrons from CdS to CoPc. The CoPc molecules then selectively reduce CO2 to CO. The interfacial dynamics and catalytic behavior are clearly revealed by time&#8208;resolved and in situ vibrational spectroscopies. In addition to serving as electron highways, the black body property of the CNT component can create local photothermal heating to activate amine&#8208;captured CO2, namely carbamates, for direct photochemical conversion without additional energy input.

         <title>A Route to Stabilize Uranium(II) and Uranium(I) Synthons in Multimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low valent uranium can be stabilized via an unprecedented mechanism involving intramolecular ligand migration: the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron reduction of the oxo&#8208;bridged UIV/UIV complex, [{(Ph3SiO)3(DME)U}2(O)], yields formal &#8220;UII&#8221;/UIV and &#8220;UI&#8221;/UIV complexes, via ligand migration and formation of uranium&#8208;arene &#948;&#8208;bond interactions, that can transfer up to three electrons to substrates by restoring the original ligand arrangement.







Abstract
Herein, we report the redox reactivity of a multimetallic uranium complex supported by triphenylsiloxide (&#8722;OSiPh3) ligands, where we show that low valent synthons can be stabilized via an unprecedented mechanism involving intramolecular ligand migration. The two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron reduction of the oxo&#8208;bridged diuranium(IV) complex [{(Ph3SiO)3(DME)U}2(&#956;&#8208;O)], 4, yields the formal &#8220;UII/UIV&#8221;, 5, and &#8220;UI/UIV&#8221;, 6, complexes via ligand migration and formation of uranium&#8208;arene &#948;&#8208;bond interactions. Remarkably, complex 5 effects the two&#8208;electron reductive coupling of pyridine affording complex 7, which demonstrates that the electron&#8208;transfer is accompanied by ligand migration, restoring the original ligand arrangement found in 4. This work provides a new method for controlling the redox reactivity in molecular complexes of unstable, low&#8208;valent metal centers, and can lead to the further development of f&#8208;elements redox reactivity.

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;Cu metal based catalyst for the deep electroreduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202301767). For the first time, a Sn&#8208;based catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce hydrocarbons was developed. This Sn&#8208;based MOF shows an unexpected performance for eCO2RR to produce CH4, whereas formate or CO are usually common products for traditional Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure and Dynamics of the Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclase for (&#8722;)&#8208;Ambroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambergris is a highly valued natural product in the fragrance industry and is also known as the &#8220;floating gold&#8221; due to its biosynthesis in the intestines of sperm whales. Owing to this scarce natural resource, the stereoselective synthesis of its most prominent olfactory component, (&#8722;)&#8208;Ambroxide, via alternative routes is attractive. In their Research Article (e202301607), S&#237;lvia Osuna, Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. demonstrate the catalytic potential of an engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase in the intricate cyclization of the precursor homofarnesol. The artwork was designed by Verena Resch, Graz.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Interactions between Polyoxometalates and Proteins for Applications in (Bio)chemistry and Medicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The specific interactions of anionic metal&#8208;oxo clusters, known as polyoxometalates (POMs) with proteins can be leveraged for a wide range of analytical and biomedical applications. For example, POMs have been developed as selective catalysts for protein modifications and have also been shown to facilitate protein crystallisation and their structural determination. POMs can also be used for the selective separation of proteins and have exhibited promising therapeutic activity due to effective inhibition of enzymes. Hence, understanding POM&#8208;protein interactions is essential for the development of POM&#8208;based materials and their implementation in several fields. Therefore, in this review we summarize in detail the key insights that have been gained so far on POM&#8208;protein interactions. Emphasis is also given to hybrid POMs functionalized with organic ligands to prompt further research in this direction due to the promising recent results on tuning POM&#8208;protein interactions through POM functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Acceptor Molecule Doping Induced &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interaction to Promote Charge Transport Kinetics for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the incorporation of 2D perovskite into 3D perovskite can greatly enhance intrinsic stability, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D/3D perovskite is still inferior to its 3D counterpart due to poor carrier transport kinetics resulted from the quantum and dielectric confinement of 2D component. To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction with 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01%. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94% after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000 h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Lanthanide Nanocomposites for Customized Synergistic Treatment of Orthotopic Multi&#8208;Tumor Cases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous photothermal ablation of multiple tumors is limited by unpredictable photo&#8208;induced apoptosis, caused by individual intratumoral differences. Here, a multi&#8208;channel lanthanide nanocomposite was used to achieve tailored synergistic treatment of multiple subcutaneous orthotopic tumors under non&#8208;uniform whole&#8208;body infrared irradiation prescription. The nanocomposite reduces intratumoral glutathione by simultaneously activating the fluorescence and photothermal channels. The fluorescence provides individual information on different tumors, allowing customized prescriptions to be made. This enables optimal induction of hyperthermia and dosage of chemo drugs, to ensure treatment efficacy, while avoiding overtherapy. With an accessional therapeutic laser system, customized synergistic treatment of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer cases with multiple tumors is possible with both high efficacy and minimized side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Here, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture fungicide.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple H&#8209;Bonding and Polyrotaxanes Dual Cross&#8208;linking Supramolecular Elastomer for High Toughness and Self&#8208;healing Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tough and self&#8208;healable substrates can enable stretchable electronics long service life. However, for substrates, it still remains a challenge to achieve both high toughness and autonomous self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Herein, a strategy by using the combined effects between quadruple H&#8208;bonding and slidable cross&#8208;links is proposed to solve the above issues in the elastomer. The elastomer exhibits high toughness (77.3 MJ/m3), fracture energy (~127.2 kJ/m2), and good healing efficiency (91%) at room temperature. The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross&#8208;linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self&#8208;healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8208;0.26 &#937;) even at the strain of 1600%.</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Butafulvenes and Their Application in the Synthesis of Highly Substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BN&#8208;butafulvenes, mono&#8208;BN isosteres of butafulvene and highly strained isomers of azaborines and B&#8208;amino boroles, have been synthesized via hydrolysis of the urana&#8208;borabicyclic complexes obtained from the reactions of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. Their 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) adducts can further isomerize to 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes. Both NMR reaction monitoring and theoretical calculations point to a reaction mechanism involving dearomative insertion of DMAP followed by two consecutive 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shifts. The photophysical studies of the highly substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes reveal a notable redshift in both the UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission spectra. The (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations corroborate the experimental data, suggesting that the strong &#960;&#8208;donating amino substitution at the 1&#8208; and/or 6&#8208;positions destabilizes the HOMO, and thus leading to a notable decrease of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Arylation of Silicon Nanocrystals with Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Derived Benzynes&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have garnered significant interest in optoelectronics and biomedical applications. Direct arylation provides pathways to enhance the solution processability of particles and manipulate the photophysical and electronic properties of SiNCs. Unfortunately, existent methods employed to prepare aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs are based on organometallic coupling or transition&#8208;metal catalytic strategies, which require metal&#8208;based reagents for preactivation or the precursors and complicated post&#8208;treatment processes for product purification. Herein, we demonstrate a metal&#8208;free method that directly functionalizes SiNCs with aryl&#8208;based ligands. We design a series of benzyne derivatives formed from the thermal cyclization of predesigned alkynes, allowing efficient arylation on hydride&#8208;terminated silicon surfaces under mild conditions. These aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs exhibit strong blue emission with nanosecond&#8208;scaled decay, suggesting the formation of new radiative recombination channel on SiNC surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinitiated Energy Transfer in Porous&#8208;Cage&#8208;Stabilised Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new composite material consisting of silver nanoparticles decorated with three&#8208;dimensional molecular organic cages based on light absorbing porphyrins. The porphyrin cages serve to both stabilize the particles and allow diffusion and trapping of small molecules close to the metallic surface. Combining these two photoactive components results in a Fano resonant interaction between the porphyrin Soret band and the nanoparticle localised surface plasmon resonance. Time resolved spectroscopy revealed the silver nanoparticles transfer up to 37% of their excited state energy to the stabilising layer of porphyrin cages. These unusual photophysics cause a 2&#8208;fold current increase in photoelectrochemical water splitting measurements. The composite structure provides a compelling proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for advanced photosensitiser systems with intrinsic porosity for photocatalytic and sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Mechanism and Chiral Transfer in CuO Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral inorganic superstructures have received considerable interest due to the chiral communication between inorganic compounds and chiral organic additives. However, the demanding fabrication and complex multilevel structure seriously hinder the understanding of chiral transfer and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we use chiral CuO superstructures as a model system to study the formation process of hierarchical chiral structures. Based on a simple and mild synthesis route, the time&#8208;resolved morphology and the in&#8208;situ chirality evolution could be easily followed. The morphology evolution of the chiral superstructure involves hierarchical assembly, including primary nanoparticles, intermediate bundles, and superstructure at different growth stages. Successive redshifts and enhancements of the CD signal support chiral transfer from the surface penicillamine ligands to the inorganic superstructure. Full&#8208;field electro&#8208;dynamical simulations reproduced the structural chirality and allowed us to predict its modulation. This work opens the door to a large family of chiral inorganic materials where chiral molecule&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly can be specifically designed to follow a bottom&#8208;up chiral transfer pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereomer Resolution of M&#8324;L&#8326; Coordination Cages by Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Resolution Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination cages can be used for enantio&#8208; and regioselective catalysis and for the selective sensing and separation of isomeric guest molecules. Here, stereoisomers of a family of coordination cages are resolved using high&#8208;resolution cyclic ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (cIM&#8208;MS). The observed ratio of diastereomers is dependent on both the metal ion and counter ion. Moreover, the point groups can be assigned through complementary NMR experiments. This method enables the identification and interrogation of the individual isomers in complex mixtures of cages which cannot be performed in solution. Furthermore, these techniques allow the stability of individual isomers within the mixture to be probed, with the T&#8208;symmetric isomers in this case shown to be more robust than the C3 and S4 analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrophosphinylation of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of methylenecyclopropanes (MCP) has presented a considerable challenge due to the difficult manipulation of regioselectivity and complicated reaction patterns. Herein, we report a straightforward Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrophosphinylation reaction of MCP via highly selective C&#8208;C bond cleavage. This allows for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of product enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanostars@Metal Organic Frameworks as Molecular Sieves for Optical Sensing and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid composites between nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been described as optimal materials for a wide range of applications in optical sensing, drug delivery, pollutant removal or catalysis. These materials are usually core shell single&#8208; or multi&#8208;nanoparticles, restricting the inorganic surface available for reaction. Here, we develop a method for the preparation of yolk&#8208;shells consisting in a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with MOF. This configuration shows more colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, seems to show some interesting synergy with gold for their application in photocatalysis and present strong optical activity to be used as SERS sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Preparation of Solid Solution&#8211;Oxide Heterojunction Photocatalysts through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Transformation Induced Pre&#8208;nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid solution&#8208;oxide heterostructures combine the advantages of solid solution and heterojunction materials to improve electronic structure and optical properties by metal doping, and enhance charge separation and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts by creating a built&#8208;in electric field. Nevertheless, the effective design and synthesis of these materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we develop a generally applicable strategy that leverages the transformable properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunctions with controllable structural and chemical compositions. The process consists of three main steps. First, MOFs with different topological structures and metal centers are transformed, accompanied by pre&#8208;nucleation of a metal oxide. Second, solid solution is prepared through calcination of the transformed MOFs. Finally, a heterojunction is formed by combining solid solution with another metal oxide group through endogenous overflow. DFT calculations and study on carrier dynamics show that the structure of the material effectively prevents electrons from returning to the bulk phase, exhibiting superior photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2. This study is expected to promote the controllable synthesis and research of MOF&#8208;derived heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Nanotechnology for&#160;Investigating&#160;Mechanical Signaling in the Immune System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune recognition occurs at specialized cell&#8208;cell junctions when immune cells and target cells physically touch. In this junction, groups of receptor&#8208;ligand complexes assemble and experience molecular forces that are ultimately generated by the cellular cytoskeleton. These forces are in the range of piconewton (pN) but play crucial roles in immune cell activation and subsequent effector responses. In this minireview, we will review the development of DNA based molecular tension sensors and their applications in mapping and quantifying mechanical forces experienced by immunoreceptors including T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR), Lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen (LFA&#8208;1), and the B&#8208;cell receptor (BCR) among others. In addition, we will highlight the use of DNA as a mechanical gate to manipulate mechanotransduction and decipher how mechanical forces regulate antigen discrimination and receptor signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Magnesiophilic Coordination Layer Stabilizes Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are seriously plagued by the direct exposure of the Mg anode to the electrolyte components, leading to spontaneous and electrochemical side reactions and interfacial passivation. Herein, a benign coordination layer is constructed at the Mg/electrolyte interface where aniline with a strong magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg is chosen as representative, which has higher adsorption energy than DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane) and trace water. This Mg coordination environment mitigates side reactions, forming a non&#8208;passivating interface consisting of aniline and much fewer by&#8208;products after several cycles. Therefore, the Mg symmetrical cell operates with a low overpotential and uniform Mg0 deposition. This interfacial coordination can also be adopted for Mg anode protection in various electrolyte cases of Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner. Here, we further elucidate the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalysts and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions by a combined theoretical DFT study and experimental study. The investigation suggests that the distinct cis&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azane framework combined with &#8220;selenium effect&#8221; and electron&#8208;withdrawing 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;Phenyl substitution pattern in catalyst enables a critical contribution to accessing excellent stability, anion affinity and solubility under polymerization conditions. Thus, the catalyst could leverage anion&#8208;binding interactions to precisely control reversible and transient dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium, allowing it to dynamically bind, recognize and pre&#8208;organize propagating ionic species and monomer, thereby facilitating efficient chain propagation and minimizing irreversible chain transfer events under mild conditions. The more in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism for anion&#8208;binding catalytic LCP reported herein should help to guide future catalyst design and to extend this concept to broader polymerization systems where ionic species serve as crucial intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>1D Choline&#8208;PbI3&#8208;Based Heterostructure Boosts Efficiency and Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI3 to form a novel crystal phase of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ChPbI3, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI3, passivating the defects of CsPbI3 more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2 ns to 49.4 ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI3 and the repair of undesired &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI3 film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI3 carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05% and a new certified record of 17.8% in hole transport material (HTM)&#8208;free inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Functionalization of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole alkaloids hold great potential in pharmaceutical and material sciences. However, the current approaches for C1 functionalization of carbazoles rely on the use of a pre&#8208;installed directing group, severely limiting their applicability and hindering their overall efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time the development of direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and acylation of carbazoles assisted by norbornene (NBE) as a transient directing mediator. Notably, the involvement of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate was suggested in this case, representing the first example of such intermediacy within the extensively studied Pd/norbornene reactions realm.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1&#8208;Azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atroposelective cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most appealing routes to construct axially chiral binaphthyl molecules due to the modular and succinct nature. Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings offer reliable synthetic means, alternative reaction modes that could be applied to broader substrate range without their pre&#8208;functionalization is highly desirable. Herein we show that the application of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst as organocatalyst could accomplish cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;naphthols with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity as well as excellent enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility. The identification of acylimidazolinone auxiliary for azo activating group, effective remote catalyst control and arene resonance effect synergistically play key roles in the development of this method. The utility is further demonstrated by transformations of the products into other binaphthyl compounds with perfectly retained axial chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology Platform for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform was created for simultaneously quantifying intracellular L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and extracellular dopamine (DA), and recording electrophysiological signals in the free&#8208;moving mice brain. Using our powerful tool, we found that Cys regulated DA by facilitating the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Molecular networks involving Cys and DA were significantly affected in the depressed mice and recovered by the treatment with N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform, together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.

         <title>Chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) Units Realizing Giant Birefringence with Transparency in the Near&#8208;Infrared for Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species are shown to be excellent birefringent &#8220;genes&#8221;. The metal polysulfide family is a rich birefringent crystal source, realizing birefringence as large as 0.58, and wide band gaps of approximately 2.0&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials is still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064&#8197;nm together with a wide band gap of 1.70&#8197;eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8211;6.2&#8197;&#956;m), wide band gap (2.3&#8197;eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064&#8197;nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.

A manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks was synthesized. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activity and offers promise as an artificial antioxidase for stem&#8208;cell therapeutics and the treatment of other ROS&#8208;related diseases.







Abstract
Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to address the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics remains challenging. Herein, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese&#8208;based antioxidase, we report a manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks that serves as an artificial antioxidase to rescue stem cell fate. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including elimination of H2O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. Consequently, Mn&#8722;PcBC efficiently rescues the bioactivity and functionality of stem cells in high&#8208;ROS&#8208;level microenvironments by protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This study offers essential insight into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8722;N5 sites in ROS scavenging and suggests new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.

Herein, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese-based antioxidase, we report a manganese-coordinated polyphthalocyanine-based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sites and 2D d-&#960;-conjugated networks that serves as an artificial antioxidase to rescue stem cell fate. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS-scavenging activities, including elimination of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, Mn&#8722;PcBC efficiently rescues the bioactivity and functionality of stem cells in high-ROS-level microenvironments by protecting the transcription of osteogenesis-related genes. This study offers essential insight into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sites in ROS scavenging and suggests new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem-cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of intrinsic surface composition and structure on the properties of single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides as cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated via the elemental&#8208;structural surface atomic arrangement control. The concomitant concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure were thus constructed, enabling the chemical&#8208;mechanical robustness of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes in the electrochemical process.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8722;Co&#8722;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82&#8201;% even at the harsh 60&#8201;&#176;C after 150&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Induced Electronic States Regulation Boosting Electroreduction of Dilute Nitrate to Ammonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B as a modifier was introduced to tune the oxidation state of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). The optimal Cu(B) exhibits a 100&#8201;% ammonia Faraday efficiency (FENH3) and a record&#8208;high yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, superior over the pristine Cu (FENH3=23&#8201;%, 12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1).







Abstract
Electrochemically converting NO3&#8722; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8722; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8722;&#8722;N concentration of 100&#8197;ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100&#8201;% NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which is more than 25&#8197;times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8722; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Embedded in Porphyrinoids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane bridgehead positions can easily be modified to carbinols under mild conditions to yield stable and simple to handle isostere building blocks. The versatility of this approach has been illustrated by creating a new family of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two rigid scaffold units.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to obtain synthetically versatile bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives using Grignard reagents. This method allows the incorporation of BCP units in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles and the synthesis of a new class of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two BCP units. In addition, a doubly N&#8208;confused system was also formed in the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the BCP bridgeheads. The pyrrole rings in BCP containing macrocycles exist in 1,3&#8208;alternate or &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; conformations, as observed from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>A BN&#8208;Doped U&#8208;Shaped Heteroacene as a Molecular Floating Gate for Ambipolar Charge Trapping Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise electrophilic aromatic borylation reaction was used to synthesize a wide band gap U&#8208;shaped BN&#8208;doped heteroacene. The donor effect of the nitrogen atoms and the high electron affinity of the boron atoms fine&#8208;tuned the electronic features, as well as the dual&#8208;functional layer enabled by supramolecular engineering, resulting in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory with large ambipolar memory windows and a high charge storage density.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band gap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements for organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron&#8208;donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed from BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge&#8208;trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM.

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The caging of amino acid side chains can provide exquisite control of protein function. The first chemical caging of carboxyl groups (Asp and Glu) in enzymic active sites is reported. Caging of a heme propionate in a protein was also feasible by this approach based on esterification with a tuned diazo compound. Decaging is enabled by small&#8208;molecule reagents that elicit a Staudinger reaction or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition.







Abstract
Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Herein, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated acids can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa value. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 residue with a pKa value of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2&#8208;Exomethylene Pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates: Discovery of Mincle&#8208;Selective Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation enabled the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates with an exomethylene group at the C2 position. These compounds are Mincle&#8208;selective ligands that do not bind to Cd1d, suggesting that the 2&#8208;OH group of natural glycoconjugates is critical for CD1d binding.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate analogues in which the sp3&#8208;hybridized C2 position of the carbohydrate structure (normally bearing a hydroxy group) is converted into a compact sp2&#8208;hybridized exomethylene group are expected to have unique biological activities. We established ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation methodology to directly prepare a variety of these 2&#8208;exomethylene pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates, including glucosylceramide analogues, in an &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;selective manner. Glucocerebrosidase GBA1 cleaves these synthetic pseudo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosylceramides similarly to native glucosylceramides. The pseudo&#8208;glucosylceramides exhibit selective ligand activity towards macrophage&#8208;inducible C&#8208;type lectin (Mincle), but unlike native glucosylceramides, are inactive towards CD1d.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Revival of Degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 to Stable Highly Luminescent Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After ageing under ambient conditions, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of as&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals drastically declined to &#8776;11&#8201;% due to the formation of surface defect states. These &#8220;optically sick&#8221; CsPbI3 nanocrystals are then revived to their cubic phase through the addition of 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH), and regain a PLQY of approximately 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 is regarded as an attractive optical luminophore, it is readily degraded to the optically inactive &#948;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions. Here, we present a simple approach to revive degraded (&#8220;optically sick&#8221;) &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 through &#8220;medication&#8221; with thiol&#8208;containing ligands. The effect of different types of thiols is systematically studied through optical spectroscopy. The structural reconstruction of degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals to cubic crystals in the presence of thiol&#8208;containing ligands is visualized through high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We found that 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH) effectively revives degraded CsPbI3 and results in high immunity towards moisture and oxygen, hitherto unreported. DSH facilitates the passivation of surface defects and etching of degraded Cs4PbI6 phase, thus reverting them back to the cubic CsPbI3 phase, leading to enhanced PL and environmental stability.

         <title>A Janus Separator based on Cation Exchange Resin and Fe Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Single&#8208;wall Carbon Nanotubes with Triply Synergistic Effects for High&#8208;areal Capacity Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A Janus separator based on cation exchange resin and Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes with triple synergistic effects is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth, mitigate polyiodide shuttle effect and facilitate redox kinetics of iodine species, which endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 battery with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42&#8722;/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accelerated electronic transmission channel with electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; was designed in conjugated polymers. This channel was found to promote charge separation and photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) represent a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8211;80.5&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;An accelerated electronic transmission channel with electron-output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; was designed in conjugated polymers. This channel was found to promote charge separation and photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) represent a promising platform for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to value-added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron-output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P-2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8211;80.5&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Monometallic C^C* Platinum(II) Formamidinate Complexes using Sterically Demanding Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a concise quantum chemical screening sterically demanding amidinate ligands were employed in the synthesis of monometallic C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. This new class of photoluminescent platinum(II) complexes features a hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength of up to 137&#8197;nm in comparison to their bimetallic counterparts explained by the loss of metallophilic interactions.







Abstract
A novel class of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes&#8212;previously considered to be inaccessible&#8212;was synthesized by an improved synthetic route utilizing ligands predicted by density functional theory calculations. Based on a concise quantum chemical screening three model ligands with varying steric demand were chosen and a series of six photoluminescent C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) formamidinate complexes was obtained. The least sterically demanding ligand led to a bimetallic complex in two isomeric forms, which could be separated and confirmed by the corresponding solid&#8208;state structures. Sterically more hindered amidinate ligands gave the monometallic complexes supporting the theoretical predictions. The monometallic complexes show a significant hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength, explained by the loss of the metal&#8208;metal interactions. Depending on the cyclometalating ligand quantum yields up to 87&#8201;% with short decay times were found for this new class of phosphorescent green&#8208;blue to pure blue platinum(II) emitters.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of methylenecyclobutanols was accomplished by C&#8722;C cleavage to release ring strain, selectively affording &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The photocatalyzed reaction proceeds in good yields, and was used for the concise synthesis of the natural product alatanone A.







Abstract
Radical additions onto olefins have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photoinduced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedented Co3S4/MoS2/peroxymonosulfate/ultrasound system to achieve a high rate of conversion from pollutants to CO through the coupling of piezocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This system is assisted by the formation of an electron transfer chain from Mo and S to Co, thus improving the thermodynamic process from carbonate to CO and enhancing the yield and selectivity. Our discovery represents a significant boost to achieving low emissions in wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully developed a coupled piezocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 not only effectively promotes the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realizes highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.

         <title>Overcoming the Trade&#8208;Off between C2H2 Sorption and Separation Performance by Regulating Metal&#8208;Alkyne Chemical Interaction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;alkyne chemical interaction of PdII and PtII in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks was regulated to obtain different binding affinities for C2H2. As a result, C2H2 could be selectively adsorbed and C2H2/CO2 could be separated at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Designing porous materials for C2H2 purification and safe storage is essential research for industrial utilization. We emphatically regulate the metal&#8208;alkyne interaction of PdII and PtII on C2H2 sorption and C2H2/CO2 separation in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA and Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA. The experimental investigations and systematic theoretical calculations reveal that PdII in Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA undergoes spontaneous chemical reaction with C2H2, leading to irreversible structural collapse and loss of C2H2/CO2 sorption and separation. Contrarily, PtII in Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA shows strong di&#8208;&#963; bond interaction with C2H2 to form specific &#960;&#8208;complexation, contributing to high C2H2 capture (28.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#8197;bar and 153&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar). The reusable Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA efficiently separates C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures with satisfying selectivity and C2H2 capacity (37&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1). This research provides valuable insight into designing high&#8208;performance MOFs for gas sorption and separation.

         <title>Crystal Structure of an i&#8208;Motif from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a biologically relevant i&#8208;motif from the HRAS oncogene was solved to 1.8&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure is a dimer of two i&#8208;motifs formed by six C&#8722;C+ pairs. The structure contains 20 base pairs, of which only two are canonical. The extensive network of capping and connecting interactions is unprecedented and suggests that auxiliary interactions are essential for i&#8208;motif stability in vivo.







Abstract
An i&#8208;motif is a non&#8208;canonical DNA structure implicated in gene regulation and linked to cancers. The C&#8208;rich strand of the HRAS oncogene, 5&#8242;&#8208;CGCCCGTGCCCTGCGCCCGCAACCCGA&#8208;3&#8242; (herein referred to as iHRAS), forms an i&#8208;motif in vitro but its exact structure was unknown. HRAS is a member of the RAS proto&#8208;oncogene family. About 19&#8201;% of US cancer patients carry mutations in RAS genes. We solved the structure of iHRAS at 1.77&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure reveals that iHRAS folds into a double hairpin. The two double hairpins associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming an i&#8208;motif dimer capped by two loops on each end and linked by a connecting region. Six C&#8722;C+ base pairs form each i&#8208;motif core, and the core regions are extended by a G&#8722;G base pair and a cytosine stacking. Extensive canonical and non&#8208;canonical base pairing and stacking stabilizes the connecting region and loops. The iHRAS structure is the first atomic resolution structure of an i&#8208;motif from a human oncogene. This structure sheds light on i&#8208;motifs folding and function in the cell.

         <title>Design of Multicomponent Peptide Fibrils with Ordered and Programmable Compositional Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent peptide nanofibrils are constructed with unprecedented degree of control over peptide arrangement. A neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning method is described to convert 8 designed peptides into the fibrils with 412 different compositional patterns with tunable compositions and peptide positions. This strategy may enable application&#8208;specific tailoring of material and biological properties of peptide fibrils.







Abstract
Advanced applications of biomacromolecular assemblies require a stringent degree of control over molecular arrangement, which is a challenge to current synthetic methods. Here we used a neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning strategy to build multicomponent peptide fibrils with an unprecedented capacity to manipulate local composition and peptide positions. Eight peptides were designed to have regulable nearest neighbors upon co&#8208;assembly, which, by simulation, afforded 412 different patterns within fibrils, with varied compositions and/or peptide positions. The fibrils with six prescribed patterns were experimentally constructed with high accuracy. The controlled patterning also applies to functionalities appended to the peptides, as exemplified by arranging carbohydrate ligands at nanoscale precision for protein recognition. This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning&#8208;based material design.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiosynthetic method for [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation is reported. This method enables the efficient ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of a broad range of aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicate that LiCl greatly promotes the oxidative addition of aryl fluorides to a nickel(0) complex, affording aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complexes at room temperature.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy is proposed by formamide as a double&#8208;face solvent to accelerate the nucleation of formamidine/cesium&#8208;based perovskites. The preferentially precipitated PbI2&#8208;DMSO crystals by formamide act as nucleation seedings to accelerate the nucleation process. The crystalline quality of the prepared perovskite film is significantly improved. The efficiency of hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exceeds 19&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19&#8201;% for the first time.

         <title>Carbazolylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle based Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two shape&#8208;persistent macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MC&#8208;COFs) with aligned porous channels were synthesized. The MC&#8208;COFs&#8217; electrical conductivities were enhanced over 6 orders of magnitude upon I2 doping, with the framework structural integrity maintained. The electrical properties of MC&#8208;COFs can be switched between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states through simple doping&#8208;regenerating cycles.







Abstract
Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09&#8197;eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.

         <title>Isobaric Stable Isotope N&#8208;Phosphorylation Labeling (iSIPL) for Ultrasensitive Proteome Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel isobaric phosphorus reagent enables the accurate quantitative proteome analysis and peptide sequencing with high sensitivity. The reporter ion clusters with characteristic P&#8722;N bonds were efficiently generated with very high intensities for protein quantification.







Abstract
Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high&#8208;throughput mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N&#8208;phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV&#8208;1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat&#8208;induced activation of HIV&#8208;1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein&#8208;protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large&#8208;scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Metallosalphen&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for NO2 Sensing: Metal Coordination Induced Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nonplanar Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) with C2v&#8208;symmetry was developed to construct 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF via in situ one pot synthesis, featuring metal coordination induced planarization of the Salphen cores. The existence of N2O2 pocket of 6OH&#8208;Salphen endows 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with higher metal density, shorter metal&#8208;metal distance and a narrower band gap, thus making it display a high response toward NO2 (766&#8201;% at 100&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl&#8208;functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) through a facile two&#8208;step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D c&#8208;MOFs through in situ one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N2O2 pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the C2v&#8208;symmetry of ligand endows Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;metal distance, Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF showcased excellent NO2 sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D c&#8208;MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D c&#8208;MOF based functional materials.

         <title>Optimizing Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;selective membrane is the key component in reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power harvesting technique. This Minireview provides an overview of the balance between ion selectivity (voltage) and ion permeability (current) in osmotic ion transport and offers a set of design guidelines for material parameters to optimize membrane performance to maximize osmotic power generation.







Abstract
The design of ion&#8208;selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.

         <title>Dimensional Reduction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional reduction strategy in which 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin, flexible metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs), has been proposed to facilitate their cryopreservation applications. The 2D MOLs displayed superior ice crystal growth inhibition for the enhanced interfacial interaction through structural deformation/stretching and increased inner ordered structures utilization efficiency.







Abstract
To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely, 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thicknesses (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and densities of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to &#8776;63&#8201;% at a very low concentration of 0.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mixed&#8208;linker MET&#8208;Fe (MET&#8208;Fe&#8208;x) was designed for breakthrough separation of 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates from petrochemical and refinery processes to higher value&#8208;added end products. We reported that the synergetic effect of shape&#8208;selective electrostatic repulsion at the pore window and electrostatic attraction inside the cavity can boost the dynamic separation performance.







Abstract
Developing porous sorbents represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation. However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8211;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.

In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; can be efficiently separated from &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-2-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; with a record capacity of 2.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Flow Cytometry&#8208;Based Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; was developed by integrating oxidation/Fenton reaction cascade, Fe3+ mediated eGFPHis decoration, and fluorescence&#8208;activated&#8208;cell&#8208;sorting into a general strategy. FlOxi was validated in two evolution campaigns targeting two oxidases, exemplifying the suitability of the platform for screening oxidase variants in an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput manner.







Abstract
Oxidases are of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical industries because they catalyze highly selective oxidations. However, oxidases found in nature often need to be re&#8208;engineered for synthetic applications. Herein, we developed a versatile and robust flow cytometry&#8208;based screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; for directed oxidase evolution. FlOxi utilizes hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidases expressed in E. coli to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fenton reaction). Fe3+ mediates the immobilization of a His6&#8208;tagged eGFP (eGFPHis) on the E. coli cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (D&#8208;AAO)&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4&#8208;fold lower Km value and a D&#8208;AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2&#8208;fold higher kcat than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide&#8208;producing oxidases and applied for non&#8208;fluorescent substrates.

         <title>Multimodal Analysis of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Nanoporous Block Copolymer Membranes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous block copolymer membranes functionalized with a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst (POM&#8208;WOC) and a light&#8208;absorbing ruthenium complex were probed and characterized using operando scanning electrochemical microscopy, ex situ spatially resolved micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Molecular scale information was obtained about the spatial distribution and catalytic performance of the membrane.







Abstract
Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst/photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.

         <title>Reversing Free&#8208;Electron Transfer of MoS2+x  Cocatalyst for Optimizing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Enables High&#160;Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between cocatalyst&#8208;photocatalyst usually induces spontaneous free&#8208;electron transfer between them, but the effect and regulation of the transfer direction on the hydrogen&#8208;adsorption energy of active sites have not received attention. Herein, to steer the free&#8208;electron transfer in a favorable direction for weakening S&#8208;Hads bonds of sulfur&#8208;rich MoS2+x , an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed for the first time. The core&#8208;shell Au@MoS2+x  cocatalyst was constructed on TiO2 to optimize the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. Research results reveal that the embedded Au can reverse the electron transfer to MoS2+x  to generate electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722; active sites, thus increasing the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of S&#8208;Hads in the Au@MoS2+x  cocatalyst. Consequently, the increase in the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy effectively destabilizes the H 1s&#8208;p antibonding and weakens the S&#8208;Hads bond, realizing the expedited desorption of Hads to rapidly generate a lot of visible H2 bubbles. This work delves deep into the latent effect of the photocatalyst carrier on cocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted paradigm for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. Mechanistic evidence of such a unique reaction mode was supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this concept has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy of scaling to decagrams, while exhibiting exceptional substrate generality and functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthetic strategy, especially the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) ORR route holds great potential in achieving highly efficient and selectivity. However, efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR is rarely harvested and the underlying mechanism for regulating the ORR pathways remains greatly obscure. Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS&#8208;COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H2O2 generation via one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS&#8208;COFs exert a superb H2O2 yield of 3904.2 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, outperforming most reported metal&#8208;free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8722;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one&#8208;step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Strategies for The Synthesis of N&#8208;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral compounds have been always considered a laboratory curiosity with rare prospects of being applied in asymmetric synthesis. Things have changed very quickly in the last twenty years when it was understood the important role and the enormous impact that these compounds have in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers became a rapidly expanding field and recent reports on the development of N&#8208;N atropisomers strongly prove how this research field is a hot topic open to new challenges and frontiers of asymmetric synthesis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral compounds have been always considered a laboratory curiosity with rare prospects of being applied in asymmetric synthesis. Things have changed very quickly in the last twenty years when it was understood the important role and the enormous impact that these compounds have in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers became a rapidly expanding field and recent reports on the development of N-N atropisomers strongly prove how this research field is a hot topic open to new challenges and frontiers of asymmetric synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N-N atropisomers highlighting the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional nanopores enabled&#160;with&#160;DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;spanning nanopores are used in label&#8208;free single&#8208;molecule sensing, next&#8208;generation portable nucleic acid sequencing, and as powerful research tools in biology, biophysics, and synthetic biology. Naturally occurring protein and peptide pores, as well as synthetic inorganic nanopores, are used in these applications, with their limitations. The structural and functional repertoire of nanopores can be considerably expanded by functionalising existing pores with DNA strands and by creating an entirely new class of nanopores by self&#8208;assembly by DNA origami. This review outlines progress in this area of functional DNA nanopores and outlines new developments to open up new applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stiba&#8208;, Arsa&#8208; and Phosphastannenes: Syntheses and Reactivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile synthesis for unprecedented stibastannene (10) featuring a Sn=Sb&#8208;double bond together with the homologous arsa&#8208; (9) and phosphastannenes (8) is presented. Chloride abstraction from respective stannyl pnictinidenes [E = P (5), As (6), Sb (7)], which were made accessible by reduction of ECl3 addition products at an intramolecular phosphine&#8208;stabilized stannylene, gave the pnictastannenes in moderate yields. The pnictastannenes coordinate Pd(PPh3)2 fragments (12&#8208;14) and the phosphastannene forms also a nickel coordination compound with the Ni(PPh3)2&#8208;fragment (11). 2,3&#8208; Dimethylbutadiene shows a [2+4]&#8208;cycloaddition (15&#8208;17) in reaction with the pnictastannenes (8&#8208;10). Products of a [2+2]&#8208;addition (18, 19) were isolated as the phosphaalkyne reaction products for 8 and 9. Addition of an O&#8208;H bond at the Sn=P&#8208;bond was found in reaction of water with phosphastannene 8. Reaction with ammonia afforded the NH3&#8208;adducts (21&#8208;23) at the tin atom for pnictastannenes 8&#8208;10. Only in the case of the arsastannene an azide reaction product featuring a three membered Sn&#8208;As&#8208;N&#8208;ring was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Styrene and Diene Structures to a Cyclic Diene: Anionic Polymerization of 1&#8208;Vinylcyclohexene (VCH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first anionic polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclo&#173;hexene (VCH). This structure may be considered as an intermediate between dienes and styrene. The polymerization of this cyclic 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;diene proceeded quantitatively in cyclohexane at 25 &#176;C with sec&#8208;butyllithium as an initiator. The obtained polymers have well&#8208;controlled molecular weights in the range of 5 to 142 kg/mol, controlled by the molar ratio of monomer and initiator, with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#272; &lt; 1.07&#8208;1.20). In situ1H NMR kinetic characteri&#173;zation revealed a weak gradient structure for the copolymers of styrene and VCH, (rSty = 2.55, rVCH = 0.39). P(VCH) obtained in cyclohexane with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator showed both 1,4&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;incorporation mode (ratio: 64:36). It was demonstrated that the micro&#173;structure of the resulting P(VCH) can be altered by the addition of a modifier (THF), resulting in increasing 3,4&#8208;microstructure (up to 78%) and elevated glass&#8208;transition temperature up to 89&#176;C. Thus, the monomer VCH polymerizes carbanionically like a diene, however leading to rigid poly&#173;mers with high glass transition temperature, which provides interesting options for combination with other dienes to well&#8208;defined polymer architectures and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Quadratic to Septic Optical Nonlinearity at Dipolar Alkynylmetal&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins are important macrocycles with applications in several areas including therapy, catalysis, and sensing. Strong nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are the key to fully exploiting the potential of these biocompatible molecules. We herein report that certain&#160;metal&#8208;alkynyl&#160;donor/nitro&#160;acceptor&#8208;functionalized porphyrins are attractive candidates for NLO applications.&#160;We show that specific examples exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearity, exceptional two&#8208;photon absorption, and outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption, and we report the first porphyrins that exhibit four&#8208;photon absorption. The two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption maxima are found at the corresponding multiples of linear absorption bands that time&#8208;dependent density functional theory assigns as&#160;admixtures of porphyrin&#8208;localized&#160;&#960;*&#160;&#223;&#160;&#960;&#160;and donor&#8208;porphyrin to porphyrin&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Acylation of Arenes by Switching from Ionic to Radical Type Chemistry Using NHC&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation which belongs to the class of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is a highly valuable and versatile reaction in synthesis. Regioselectivity is well predictable and determined by electronic as well as steric factors of the (hetero)arene substrate. In this communication, a radical approach for the acylation of arenes and heteroarenes is presented. C&#8722;H Acylation is achieved through mild cooperative photoredox/NHC radical catalysis with the cross coupling of an arene radical cation with an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical as a key step. As compared to the classical Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation, a regiodivergent outcome is observed upon switching from the ionic to the radical mode. In these divergent reactions, aroyl fluorides act as the acylation reagents in both the ionic as well as the radical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Conversion in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intensifying energy crises and severe environmental issues have led to the discovery of renewable energy sources, sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. Photocatalysis is a green technology that converts eco&#8208;friendly and inexhaustible solar energy into high&#8208;energy chemicals. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous materials constructed by covalent bonds that show promising potential for converting solar energy into chemicals owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures, high crystallinity, and porosity. Herein, we highlight recent progress in the synthesis of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting, CO2 reduction, and H2O2 production. The challenges and future opportunities for the rational design of COFs for advanced photocatalysts are discussed. This review is expected to promote further development of COFs toward photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Multiple constituent coassembly is an emerging strategy to manipulate supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, the second or third constituent could not be removed from pristine self&#8208;assembly. Here we developed a constitute&#8208;removable chiral coassembly using sublimation that could realize coassembly with tunable supramolecular chirality, luminescence and CPL properties. Octafluoronapthalene (OFN) with small sublimation enthalpy formed coassemblies with perylene&#8208;conjugated peptoids via arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction that induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and hypochromic luminescence from yellow to green. Coassembly with OFN accelerated one&#8208;dimensional growth and induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and CPL. Despite the stability at ambient conditions, vacuum&#8208;treatment triggered fast sublimation of OFN, which behaved as a sacrificial template. Physical removal of OFN retained the helical nanoarchitectures as well as the basic features of Cotton effects and CPL activities. X&#8208;ray diffraction suggested the back&#8208;fill consolidation occurred on the molecular voids by OFN removal that slightly varied the templated molecular arrangements. Sublimation of perfluorinated building units is green and efficient and non&#8208;destructive, which is potentially applicable in constructing template&#8208;directed chiroptical materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co&#8208;related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor&#8208;targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT&#8208;116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT&#8208;116 in vivo.







Abstract
NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.

         <title>Expanded Conformations of Monomeric Tau Initiate Its Amyloidogenesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule analysis of tau shows that pro&#8208;amyloidogenic mutations and chemical environment shift the monomeric conformational landscape towards expanded conformers, exposing amyloidogenic hexapeptides. The chemical environment also originates structural rearrangements, which may be behind the polymorphic amyloid structures found across tauopathies. Conversely, anti&#8208;amyloidogenic factors promote the formation of collapsed conformers with a specific inert structure.







Abstract
Understanding early amyloidogenesis is key to rationally develop therapeutic strategies. Tau protein forms well&#8208;characterized pathological deposits but its aggregation mechanism is still poorly understood. Using single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy based on a mechanical protection strategy, we studied the conformational landscape of the monomeric tau repeat domain (tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368). We found two sets of conformational states, whose frequency is influenced by mutations and the chemical context. While pathological mutations &#916;280K and P301L and a pro&#8208;amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti&#8208;amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368 decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found in vitro and across tauopathies.

         <title>Modulating Thermal Properties of Polymers through Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of multicomponent solids involving both small and polymeric molecules resulted in the preparation of cocrystals with melting points higher than the melting point of the pure polymer. At the same time, the high mechanical flexibility of the polymer is maintained even under harsh milling conditions, allowing the formation of toroidal nanoparticles with small inner radii and high curvatures.







Abstract
Crystal engineering has exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We now demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer yields a material with significantly enhanced thermal stability but equivalent mechanical flexibility. Isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a usefully wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Reveals High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using mass spectrometry and biological techniques, we found that H2O2 is dysregulated in PDAC, further validating that the main reasons for H2O2 enrichment in PDAC cells may be that oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes H2O2 production and silences CAT levels in PDAC. Furthermore, we identified that H2O2 affects the cells&#8217; metabolic profile and promotes the survival of PDAC cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry&#8208;based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H2O2 modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H2O2 in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Epitope Imprinting of Phospholipids by Oriented Assembly at the Oil/Water Interface for the Selective Recognition of Plasma Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>

An imprinting strategy for targeting the polar epitope of phospholipids was developed based on reversed phase microemulsion oriented molecular imprinting. The prepared phospholipid&#8208;MIP can specifically recognize plasma membranes via a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet and thus differentiate physiological conditions of cells such as apoptosis, providing an alternative tool for targeted drug delivery and theranostics.







Abstract
Phospholipids, as fundamental building blocks of the cell membrane, play important roles for molecule transportation, cell recognition, etc. However, due to the structural diversity and amphipathic nature, there are few methods for the specific recognition of lipids as compared to other biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Herein, we developed a molecular imprinting strategy for controllable imprinting toward the polar head of phospholipid exposed on the surface of cellular membranes for recognition. Phosphatidylserine, as unique lipid on the outer membrane leaflet of exosome and also hallmark for cell apoptosis, was imprinted with the developed method. The phosphatidylserine imprinted materials showed high efficiency and specific targeting capability not only for apoptotic cell imaging but also for the isolation of exosomes. Collectively, the synthesized molecularly imprinted materials have great potential for selective plasma membrane recognition for targeted drug delivery and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Isolation of an Annulated 1,4&#8208;Distibabenzene Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide (cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene) compound 5 is isolated as a crystalline solid. 5 undergoes 2e&#8208;oxidation to the dicationic compound (6)2+, which can be reduced back to 5. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet solution. (6)+2 is stabilized by the delocalization of unpaired electrons over the benzenoid C4Sb2 ring and has 39&#8201;% diradical character.







Abstract
The first 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Sb]2 (5) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC) (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported as a bordeaux&#8208;red solid. Compound 5, featuring a central six&#8208;membered C4Sb2 ring with formally SbI atoms may be regarded as a base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene in which each of the Sb atoms bears two lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. 5 undergoes 2&#8201;e&#8208;oxidation with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] to afford [(ADC)Sb]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (6) as a brick&#8208;red solid. Each of the Sb atoms of 6 has an unpaired electron and a lone&#8208;pair. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet diradical solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet. The diradical character of (6)2+ according to SS&#8208;CASSCF (state&#8208;specific complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) and UHF (unrestricted Hartree&#8208;Fock) methods amounts to 36&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively. Treatments of 6 with (PhE)2 yield [(ADC)Sb(EPh)]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (7&#8208;E) (E=S or Se). Reaction of 5 with (cod)Mo(CO)4 affords [(ADC)Sb]2Mo(CO)4 (8).

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four highly porous pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The reported findings highlight that the presence of pyrene active sites in very close proximity leads to unwanted H2O2 decomposition. Accordingly, a biphasic system (benzyl alcohol and water) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition.







Abstract
Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF though contains more pyrene units than other COFs which induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in close proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

         <title>Rational Utilization of Black Phosphorus Nanosheets to Enhance Palladium&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Catalytic Activity for Activation of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to enhance palladium&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity by using a powerful partner: black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, which can accelerate the transformation of Pd2+ to Pd0 to boost the reaction cycle, thus achieving a superior decaging efficiency of prodyes and prodrugs.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed chemistry has played a significant role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis. However, rationally designing Pd nanocatalysts that show outstanding catalytic activity and good biocompatibility poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy through exploiting black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) to enhance Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity. Firstly, the electron&#8208;donor properties of BPNSs enable in situ growth of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on it. Meanwhile, due to the superb capability of reducing PdII, BPNSs can act as hard nucleophiles to accelerate the transmetallation in the decaging reaction process. Secondly, the lone pair electrons of BPNSs can firmly anchor PdNPs on their surface via Pd&#8722;P bonds. This design endows Pd/BP with the capability to retard tumor growth by activating prodrugs. This work proposes new insights into the design of heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts (TMCs) for bioorthogonal catalysis.

A remarkable enhancement of charge transport at a molecular junction is realized in pillar[5]arene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers through host&#8211;guest interactions with cationic guest molecules. The improved charge transport is positively correlated with the strong binding affinity between pillar[5]arene and cationic guest molecules, which results in a delocalized structure in the supramolecular complex and a reduced energy offset.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport is one of the essential modes for modulating charge transport in molecular electronic devices. Supermolecules are highly promising candidates for molecular devices because of their abundant structures and easy functionalization. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to enhance charge transport through pillar[5]arene self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by introducing cationic guests. The current density of pillar[5]arene SAMs can be raised up to about 2.1 orders of magnitude by inserting cationic molecules into the cavity of pillar[5]arenes in SAMs. Importantly, we have also observed a positive correlation between the charge transport of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complex SAMs and the binding affinities of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complexation. Such an enhancement of charge transport is attributed to the efficient host&#8211;guest interactions that stabilize the supramolecular complexes and lower the energy gaps for charge transport. This work provides a predictive pattern for the regulation of intermolecular charge transport in guiding the design of next generation switches and functional sensors in supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Tuning the Microenvironment in Monolayer MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrocatalysis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>

A monolayered MgAl layered double hydroxide (MgAl&#8208;LDH) is used for the regulation of the local environment of Cu as catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electroreduction in neutral media. The catalyst benefits from the lower energy barrier of MgAl&#8208;LDH for water dissociation and an OH&#8722; enriched environment at the reaction interface, delivering a high C2H4 selectivity at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide provides a feasibility to achieve a carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle. However, there are a number of bottleneck issues to be resolved before industrial application, such as the low conversion efficiency, selectivity and reaction rate, etc. Engineering local environment is a critical way to address these challenges. Here, a monolayer MgAl&#8208;LDH was proposed to optimize the local environment of Cu for stimulating industrial&#8208;current&#8208;density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 electroreduction in neutral media. In situ spectroscopic results and theoretical study demonstrated that the Cu electrode modified by MgAl&#8208;LDH (MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu) displayed a much higher surface pH value compared to the bare Cu, which could be attributed to the decreased energy barrier for hydrolysis on MgAl&#8208;LDH sites with more OH&#8722; ions on the surface of the electrode. As a result, MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu achieved a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 55.1&#8201;% at a current density up to 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KHCO3 electrolyte.

         <title>Decrypting the Controlled Product Selectivity over Ag&#8722;Cu Bimetallic Surface Alloys for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity when their surface compositions and the applied potentials were rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations. A predominant region map describing the thermodynamic predominance of *CO involved subsequent reactions is provided as reliable guidance for the design of catalysts for CO2 reduction towards value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controlled product selectivity is realized on Ag&#8722;Cu bimetallic surface alloys, with high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;60&#8201;% faradaic efficiency, FE), C1 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;41&#8201;% FE) and CO (&#8776;74&#8201;% FE) achieved by tuning surface compositions and applied potentials. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface&#8208;composition&#8208;dependent d&#8208;band center could tune *CO binding strengths, regulating the *CO subsequent reaction pathways and then the product selectivity. Further adjusting the applied potentials will alter the energy of participated electrons, which leads to controlled ECO2RR selectivity towards desired products. A predominant region map, with an indicator proposed to evaluate the thermodynamic predominance of the *CO subsequent reactions, is then provided as a reliable theoretical guidance for the controllable ECO2RR product selectivity over bimetallic alloys.

         <title>Suppressing Universal Cathode Crossover in High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Batteries via a Versatile Interlayer Design
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin versatile interlayer consisting of multifunctional adsorption sites is introduced to suppress the cathode crossover in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries using various high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Ni&#8208;rich layered metal oxide cathode, Li&#8208;/Mn&#8208;rich cathode, and sulfur cathode, while stabilizing the lithium stripping/plating process even under current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The universal cathode crossover such as chemical and oxygen has been significantly overlooked in lithium metal batteries using high&#8208;energy cathodes which leads to severe capacity degradation and raises serious safety concerns. Herein, a versatile and thin (&#8776;25&#8197;&#956;m) interlayer composed of multifunctional active sites was developed to simultaneously regulate the Li deposition process and suppress the cathode crossover. The as&#8208;induced dual&#8208;gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase combined with abundant lithiophilic sites enable stable Li stripping/plating process even under high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray experiments revealed that N&#8208;rich framework and CoZn dual active sites can effectively mitigate the undesired cathode crossover, hence significantly minimizing Li corrosion. Therefore, assembled lithium metal cells using various high&#8208;energy cathode materials including LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, Li1.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15O2, and sulfur demonstrate significantly improved cycling stability with high cathode loading.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides has been developed utilizing an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. While initial mechanistic studies identified SO2 as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2 slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5.







Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.

While initial mechanistic studies identified SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion occurs via dissolved SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel-catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench-free, inorganic sulfur salt (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) as a uniquely effective SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion occurs via dissolved SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as a reservoir of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Laser Writing of Block&#8208;Copolymer Images into Mesopores Using SBDC&#8208;Initiated Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the iniferter N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) under visible&#8208;light irradiation with and without additional photocatalyst is demonstrated for the first time. Through the transfer of the polymerization to a commercially available microscope, automated laser writing of different polymers in mesoporous silica films is realized.







Abstract
For miniaturization, as well as for improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are beneficial. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm and 405&#8197;nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40&#8197;&#956;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8211;5&#8197;seconds for each irradiated spot.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;Static Planar Chirality Conversion in Pillar[5]arenes Regulated by Guest Solvents or Amplified by Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pR and pS forms of pillar[5]arene regulated by short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain guest solvents, respectively, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups through click reactions. The diastereomeric excess was also amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded a pillar[5]arene with excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8197;de).







Abstract
Controlling dynamic chirality and memorizing the controlled chirality are important. Chirality memory has mainly been achieved using noncovalent interactions. However, in many cases, the memorized chirality arising from noncovalent interactions is erased by changing the conditions such as the solvent and temperature. In this study, the dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes was successfully converted into static planar chirality by introducing bulky groups through covalent bonds. Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbon atoms at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion that was dependent on the chain length of the guest solvent. The pS and pR forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore, the diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with an excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8201;de).

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;atomic Pt nanozyme was developed using a facile missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination strategy. The nanozyme shows superior catalase&#8208;mimicking activity for the catalytic conversion of H2O2 overproduced in tumors into localized O2 for tumor hypoxia alleviation, which leads to enhanced ROS generation from loaded photosensitizers for apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to a Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, a Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus exhibiting a more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.

         <title>Electrochemical Nano&#8208;Roughening of Gold Microstructured Electrodes for Enhanced Sensing in Biofluids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically structured high electroactive surface area gold electrodes were fabricated using a simple and inexpensive thermal wrinkling approach and a chronoamperometric pulsing nanoroughening method. The nanoroughened electrodes showed antifouling capabilities and could be used for the sensitive electrochemical detection of copper in tap&#8208;water and for the enzyme&#8208;free detection of glucose in human blood serum samples.







Abstract
A key challenge for sensor miniaturization is to create electrodes with smaller footprints, while maintaining or increasing sensitivity. In this work, the electroactive surface of gold electrodes was enhanced 30&#8208;fold by wrinkling followed by chronoamperometric (CA) pulsing. Electron microscopy showed increased surface roughness in response to an increased number of CA pulses. The nanoroughened electrodes also showed excellent fouling resistance when submerged in solutions containing bovine serum albumin. The nanoroughened electrodes were used for electrochemical detection of Cu2+ in tap water and of glucose in human blood plasma. In the latter case, the nanoroughened electrodes allowed highly sensitive enzyme&#8208;free sensing of glucose, with responses comparable to those of two commercial enzyme&#8208;based sensors. We anticipate that this methodology to fabricate nanostructured electrodes can accelerate the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective, and high sensitivity electrochemical platforms.

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy toward scalable nanofluidic osmotic power generation by using PSS/HKUST&#8208;1 membrane with subnanometer pores and using hypersaline water sources. The hypersaline water sources provide high ionic conductivity and the subnanometer pores guarantee charge selectivity under high salinity. The power density stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 when the membrane area increased to 7&#8197;mm2, the highest for macro&#8208;sized nanofluidic membranes.







Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane's charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.

         <title>Cationic Tetrylene&#8208;Iron(0) Complexes: Access Points for Cooperative, Reversible Bond Activation and Open&#8208;Shell Iron(&#8722;I) Ferrato&#8208;Tetrylenes
</title>

         <dc:description>
Cationic tetrylene centres, built into a chelating ligand framework, allow for the formation of reactive CO&#8208;free iron(0) complexes. For Sn, a highly reactive high&#8208;spin, open&#8208;shell d8 complex is formed, capable of the cooperative, reversible activation of H2 at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface. Both EII&#8722;Fe0 complexes (E=Ge, Sn) also undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form unique iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;tetrylenes, a compound class which was previously unknown.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell cationic stannylene&#8208;iron(0) complex 4 (4=[PhiPDippSn&#8901;Fe&#8901;IPr]+; PhiPDipp={[Ph2PCH2Si(iPr)2](Dipp)N}; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr=[(Dipp)NC(H)]2C:) cooperatively and reversibly cleaves dihydrogen at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface under mild conditions (1.5&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), in forming bridging hydrido&#8208;complex 6. The One&#8208;electron oreduction of the related GeII&#8722;Fe0 complex 3 leads to oxidative addition of one C&#8722;P linkage of the PhiPDipp ligand in an intermediary Fe&#8722;I complex, leading to FeI phosphide species 7. One&#8208;electron reduction reaction of 4 gives access to the iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;stannylene, 8, giving evidence for the transient formation of such a species in the reduction of 3. The covalently bound tin(II)&#8208;iron(&#8722;I) compound 8 has been characterised through EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and supporting computational analysis, which strongly indicate a high localization of electron spin density at Fe&#8722;I in this unique d9&#8208;iron complex.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyphenylene Wires Comprising Rigid Aliphatic Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Isolator Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenylene wires regularly substituted with rigid aliphatic bicyclopentane isolators were obtained by on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterized with submolecular precision.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs are of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry as sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres of benzene rings and as molecular building blocks in materials science. Herein we explore the behavior of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties on metal surfaces by combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy / non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy studies with density functional theory modeling. We examine the configuration of individual BCP&#8208;containing precursors on Au(111), their supramolecular assembly and thermally activated dehalogenative coupling reactions, affording polymeric chains with incorporated electronically isolating units. Our studies not only provide the first sub&#8208;molecular insights of the BCP scaffold behavior on surfaces, but also extend the potential application of BCP derivatives towards integration in custom&#8208;designed surface architectures.

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the chiral iron porphyrin catalyzed transformation of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides into chiral indolines and sultams, respectively. The reaction proceeds upon visible light irradiation and with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of meso&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples), respectively, with up to 93&#8201;% ee (yield: up to 99&#8201;%) using 410&#8197;nm light under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO2Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO2Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.

         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known cyclization reaction between furan and nucleotides of nucleic acid triggered by 1O2, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification (NIMiRM) strategy was herein developed for long&#8208;term NIR/PA dual&#8208;modality imaging and remarkable suppression of tumors in vivo.







Abstract
Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, this covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Two Light and Pressure Responsive Physisorbents</title>

         <dc:description>
An emerging strategy to enable energy efficient gas storage and separation technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents. Herein, we report two isostructural light&#8208;modulated adsorbents (LMAs) which undergo pressure&#8208;induced transformations from closed (non&#8208;porous) to open (porous) phases via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2.







Abstract
An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene (BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT=2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT=5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate). Both LMAs undergo pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55&#8201;% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298&#8197;K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Intermolecular Coupling of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new protocols for regiodivergent and enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes promoted by easily accessible Co complexes were developed. These processes represent the first example of transformations through enantioselective oxidative cyclization of allenes and aldehydes with diverse regioselectivities accurately controlled by chiral ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes through regiodivergent oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation or reductive elimination promoted by chiral phosphine&#8208;Co complexes is presented. Such processes represent unprecedented and unique reaction pathways for Co catalysis that enable catalytic enantioselective generation of metallacycles with divergent regioselectivity accurately controlled by chiral ligands, affording a wide range of allylic alcohols and homoallylic alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of alkenyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;metal reagents in up to 92&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er.

         <title>An Efficient Opal&#8208;Suppressor Tryptophanyl Pair Creates New Routes for Simultaneously Incorporating up to Three Distinct Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins in Mammalian Cells
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study significantly expands the scope of multiple noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells by developing a tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair that efficiently decodes the TGA stop codon. It can be combined with three previously established pairs to create new ways to incorporate up to three distinct ncAAs into a protein in mammalian cells. Using this technology, two distinct cytotoxic drugs were site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a full&#8208;length humanized antibody.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is a promising technology, where each ncAA must be assigned to a different orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that reads a distinct nonsense codon. Available pairs suppress TGA or TAA codons at a considerably lower efficiency than TAG, limiting the scope of this technology. Here we show that the E. coli tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA&#8208;suppressor in mammalian cells, which can be combined with the three other established pairs to develop three new routes for dual&#8208;ncAA incorporation. Using these platforms, we site&#8208;specifically incorporated two different bioconjugation handles into an antibody with excellent efficiency, and subsequently labeled it with two distinct cytotoxic payloads. Additionally, we combined the EcTrp pair with other pairs to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of a Pyryne Precursor to Higher Pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By palladium&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene&#8208;based o&#8208;trimethylsilyl triflates, larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10&#8208;membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The palladium catalyzed cyclotrimerization of ortho&#8208;silylaryl triflates as aryne precursors is meanwhile an established method to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with triphenylene cores. During the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a pyrene with an o&#8208;silylaryl triflate moiety in the K&#8208;region higher homologues with central eight&#8208; and ten&#8208;membered rings (the pyrenylenes) were found, besides the expected trimer and a protocol was developed to isolate all members of this series. This unprecedented new class of PAHs was fully investigated by all means, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of single&#8208;crystals, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, a mechanism of all higher cyclooligomers is proposed.

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conversion of inert N2 into various nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds is presented. The activated N&#8208;containing species Li2CN2 is successfully prepared in high yields from N2 gas, C and LiH. Li2CN2 can be transformed into a range of N&#8208;containing organic compounds, including cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives. 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives, have also been prepared from 15N2 gas.







Abstract
Through the synergies of a heterogeneous synthetic approach and a homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including a substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; in proteins. But does the infinitely long &#946;&#8208;sheet structure of amyloids allow for such motions? In this study, we apply specific isotope labeling and solid&#8208;state NMR to two amyloid fibrils to demonstrate that the motion of aromatic rings strongly differs between the core and the surface of the fibril.







Abstract
Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8211;protein interactions. We studied aromatic residues in the two structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils HET&#8208;s, and HELLF by employing a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning NMR. The dynamic behavior of the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr indicates that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips on a variety of time scales from nanoseconds to microseconds. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from an NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled deformation of soft nanogel particles during their occlusion within calcite crystals enables the generation of artificial biominerals with oriented internal structure. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and indicates that the rational design of multi&#8208;scale nanocomposite materials should be feasible via nanoparticle occlusion.







Abstract
Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. This deformation occurs normal to the growth direction of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reactions Accelerated by Interpretable Intrinsic Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an interpretable intrinsic descriptor to accelerate the high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;single&#8208;atom catalysts without calculations by combining physical insights with machine learning. The role of metal&#8208;ligand interaction on activity is also clarified using this descriptor. A series of experiments further verify the descriptor's guidance.







Abstract
Developing easily accessible descriptors is crucial but challenging to rationally design single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). This paper describes a simple and interpretable activity descriptor, which is easily obtained from the atomic databases. The defined descriptor proves to accelerate high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;graphene&#8208;based SACs without computations, universal for 3&#8211;5d transition metals and C/N/P/B/O&#8208;based coordination environments. Meanwhile, the analytical formula of this descriptor reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. Using electrochemical nitrogen reduction as an example, this descriptor's guidance role has been experimentally validated by 13&#8197;previous reports as well as our synthesized 4&#8197;SACs. Orderly combining machine learning with physical insights, this work provides a new generalized strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;throughput screening while comprehensive understanding the structure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppressive strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) enable hot electrons excited on Ru to transfer to a TiO2&#8722;H2 support, thereby reducing the electron density on Ru and accelerating light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with methane. The optimized Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 composite exhibits an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 400&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis field, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electron transfer is rarely explored. Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2, a considerable number of photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&#948;+ electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two&#8208;phase interactions.

Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction by CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; due to the photo-induced transfer of electrons from TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; achieves a 46-fold CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a considerable number of photo-excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two-phase interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Branched Multimeric Peptides as Affinity Reagents for the Detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Klotho recognizing branched peptides were prepared via parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis. The branched peptide binders show at least a 30&#8208;fold improvement in affinity relative to the monomeric versions, can be used to study Klotho engagement by pull&#8208;down from cell lysates, and label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Klotho, an aging&#8208;related protein found in the kidney, parathyroid gland, and choroid plexus, acts as an essential co&#8208;receptor with the fibroblast growth factor 23 receptor complex to regulate serum phosphate and vitamin D levels. Decreased levels of &#945;&#8208;Klotho are a hallmark of age&#8208;associated diseases. Detecting or labeling &#945;&#8208;Klotho in biological milieu has long been a challenge, however, hampering the understanding of its role. Here, we developed branched peptides by single&#8208;shot parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis that recognize &#945;&#8208;Klotho with improved affinity relative to their monomeric versions. These peptides were further shown to selectively label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells. Our results demonstrate that automated flow technology enables rapid synthesis of complex peptide architectures, showing promise for future detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho in physiological settings.

         <title>Unsupervised Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>

A virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) model was used to automatically search the chemical space containing over 420&#8201;000 candidates and identified promising AEMs with highly chemical stability.







Abstract
Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new and general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst can efficiently catalyze both the hydrazine oxidation and nitrate reduction reactions so as to assemble a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery with electricity and ammonia generation.







Abstract
The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and continuously operates for 20&#8197;h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.

         <title>Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Small Molecules: Long&#8208;Axis Polymerization Leads to a Nearly Concentration&#8208;Independent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence has been demonstrated by polymerizing a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor type TADF small molecule through its long&#8208;axis direction rather than the short&#8208;axis one. The corresponding PLQY remains almost unchanged, leading a promising EQE up to 20&#8201;% in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20&#8201;% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.

This material exhibits wider temperature adaptability for potassium storage, benefiting from a greater number of hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights into the intrinsic formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms are also put forward.







Abstract
Antimony (Sb)&#8208;based anodes are attractive candidates in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their superior capacities and rational potassium inserting voltages. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interface compatibility severely hinder practical application. Herein, Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanospheres embedded into in situ formed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PET@PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA) were elaborately conceptualized with hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA exhibits notable self&#8208;healing ability and wider temperature adaptability. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA displays an impressive capacity of 819&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, prominent cycle ability with a 73&#8201;% capacity conservation after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high capacity retention of 66&#8201;% and 84&#8201;% at &#8722;40 and 70&#8201;&#176;C to that case at room temperature, respectively, for potassium storage. This work provides a new perspective for HBEB sites in maximizing the desirable K+ storage performance.

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo&#8208;mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox&#8208;active esters, captured by 2&#8208;azadienes to provide 2&#8208;azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. The preparation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2&#8208;azadienes to access functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles by using redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95&#8201;% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5). The products were transformed into prized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.

A pair of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) copper cluster&#8208;assembled chains was prepared, which exhibited unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation. Based on this work, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was constructed, which showed reversible photo&#8208;response with excellent fatigue resistance.







Abstract
In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum=9&#215;10&#8722;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.

         <title>Ruthenium/TiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate: Reaction Pathways Dominated by Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO2 dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring&#8208;opening reactions.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.

&lt;p&gt;The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under-coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring-opening reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under-coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well-coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat-lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Catalysis Made Asymmetric&#8212;Enantiomerization Catalysis Mediated by the Chiral &#960;&#8208;System of a Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of [5]helicene enantiomerization has been enhanced by a factor of about 700 by using a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane host at room temperature. Computational models suggest the reaction barrier is lowered through a stabilization of the nonplanar transition&#8208;state structure of [5]helicene within the cyclophane through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis, supported by a ground&#8208;state destabilization of the heterochiral host&#8211;guest complex.







Abstract
Enzymes actuate catalysis through a combination of transition state stabilization and ground state destabilization, inducing enantioselectivity through chiral binding sites. Here, we present a supramolecular model system which employs these basic principles to catalyze the enantiomerization of [5]helicene. Catalysis is hereby mediated not through a network of functional groups but through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis exerted from the curved aromatic framework of a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane offering a binding pocket that is intricately complementary with the enantiomerization transition structure. Although transition state stabilization originates simply from dispersion and electrostatic interactions, enantiomerization kinetics are accelerated by a factor of ca. 700 at 295&#8197;K. Comparison with the meso&#8208;congener of the catalytically active cyclophane shows that upon configurational inversion in only one PBI moiety the catalytic effect is lost, highlighting the importance of precise transition structure recognition in supramolecular enzyme mimics.

         <title>MALDI Imaging Assisted Discovery of a Di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase from Platycodon grandiflorum Root</title>

A MALDI MS imaging assisted genome screening strategy was developed and enabled the identification and characterization of a di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 from Platycodon grandiflorum root.







Abstract
A matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) assisted genome mining strategy was developed for the discovery of glycosyltransferase (GT) from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum. A di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 was discovered and characterized that is capable of catalyzing platycoside&#8197;E (PE) synthesis through the attachment of two &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;linked glucosyl residues sequentially to the glucosyl residue at the C3 position of platycodin&#8197;D (PD). Although UDP&#8208;glucose is the preferred sugar donor for PgGT1, it could also utilize UDP&#8208;xylose and UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine as weak donors. Residues S273, E274, and H350 played important roles in stabilizing the glucose donor and positioning the glucose in the optimal orientation for the glycosylation reaction. This study clarified two key steps involved in the biosynthetic pathway of PE and could greatly contribute to improving its industrial biotransformation.

         <title>Study of Intermolecular Reconfiguration of Flexible COF&#8208;5 Film and Its Ultra&#8208;high Chemiresistive Humidity Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible COF&#8208;5 film is synthesized on PI substrate by a vapor&#8208;assisted conversion method and used to fabricate a humidity sensor. The sensor shows resistance response to 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH over 4 orders of magnitude and maintains a linear relation even when bent at 180&#176;. Simulations are applied to reveal the intermolecular reconfiguration mechanism in humidity sensing. The superior sensitivity makes COF&#8208;5 films a potential candidate for human respiration monitoring.







Abstract
Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DFT simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound IBr as a cathode, in which the active I fixes the oxidized Br0 without generating crossing&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charge and discharge process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers improved energy density compared with those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes.







Abstract
Though massive efforts have been devoted to exploring Br&#8208;based batteries, the highly soluble Br2/Br3&#8722; species causing rigorous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, leads to severe self&#8208;discharge and low Coulombic efficiency. Conventionally, quaternary ammonium salts such as methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) are used to fix Br2 and Br3&#8722;, but they occupy the mass and volume of battery without capacity contribution. Here, we report an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound, IBr, as a cathode to address the above challenges, in which the oxidized Br0 is fixed by iodine (I), thoroughly eliminating cross&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charging and discharging process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers remarkably high energy density of 385.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is higher than those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes. Our work provides new approaches to achieve active solid interhalogen chemistry for high&#8208;energy electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the understanding of intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the interactions with all pertinent intermediates, an efficient Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx electrocatalyst was designed and proven to realize mutual coordination among functions of active sites on the efficient dissociative adsorption of water, the easy desorption of OH&#8722;, and the facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation concurrently, leading to significantly boosted alkaline HER kinetics.







Abstract
Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Gram&#8208;scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulation of Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High&#8208;Efficiency Catalase Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the atomic structures of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes and their catalase&#8208;like performance is established by both computational screening and experimental design. A strategy is elucidated for atomic&#8208;level regulation of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes operating as catalase mimics.







Abstract
Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase&#8208;like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co&#8208;N3PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase&#8208;like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co&#8208;based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure&#8208;oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme&#8208;like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.

A nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering strategy is proposed and a series of congeners of BN&#8208;TP (a triphenylene core substituted with two di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole motifs and coordinated with one boron atom), namely BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4), are constructed. Anchoring the nitrogen&#8208;atom at different positions of triphenylene hexagonal lattice results in varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters demonstrate the precise regulation of emission maxima to meet industrial demand, and further enrich the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as a privileged motif for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they furnish highly tunable TADF characteristics and high color purity emission. Herein, based on the unique nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering (NEME) strategy, a series of compounds BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4) have been customized. The nitrogen&#8208;atom anchored at different position of triphenylene hexagonal lattice entails varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed emitters have demonstrated the precise regulation of emission maxima of MR&#8208;TADF emitters to meet the actual industrial demand, and further enormously enriched the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir. The BN&#8208;TP&#8208;N3&#8208;based OLED exhibits ultrapure green emission, with peak of 524&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.71), and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Anchored Molybdenum Oxide Nanoclusters as Efficient Catalysts for the Electrosynthesis of Ammonia and Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoOx nanoclusters supported on carbon black are used as highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for selective synthesis of NH3 and urea via nitrate reduction and its coupling with CO2. This work opens up new opportunities for the rational design of novel electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic activation of small molecules for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
The electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction and its coupling with CO2 can provide novel and clean routes to synthesize NH3 and urea, respectively. However, their practical application is still impeded by the lack of efficient catalysts with desirable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield rate. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanoclusters anchored on carbon black (MoOx/C) as electrocatalyst. It affords an outstanding FE of 98.14&#8201;% and NH3 yield rate of 91.63&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in NO3&#8722; reduction. Besides, the highest FE of 27.7&#8201;% with a maximum urea yield rate of 1431.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 toward urea is also achieved. The formation of electron&#8208;rich MoOx nanoclusters with highly unsaturated metal sites in the MoOx/C heterostructure is beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the stabilization of *NO and *CO2NOOH intermediates are critical for the NH3 and urea synthesis, respectively.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and its coupling with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can provide novel and clean routes to synthesize NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and urea, respectively. However, their practical application is still impeded by the lack of efficient catalysts with desirable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield rate. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanoclusters anchored on carbon black (MoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/C) as electrocatalyst. It affords an outstanding FE of 98.14&#8201;% and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 91.63&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. Besides, the highest FE of 27.7&#8201;% with a maximum urea yield rate of 1431.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; toward urea is also achieved. The formation of electron-rich MoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters with highly unsaturated metal sites in the MoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/C heterostructure is beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the stabilization of *NO and *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NOOH intermediates are critical for the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and urea synthesis, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mimicking Photosynthesis: A Natural Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst Constructed from Red Mud Bauxite Waste for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;mimicking Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst was constructed by coupling acid&#8208;activated and alkali&#8208;treated red mud bauxite waste with an iron electron mediator. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state system presented a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for overall water splitting, which even exceeded several artificially synthesized Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts. This work provides a sustainable way for new energy production through component engineering of natural mineral&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for solar fuel production. However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z&#8208;Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen&#8208;induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z&#8208;Scheme electron transfer from &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible strategy is proposed for obtaining environmentally stable defective black phosphorene via simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection. Due to the inherent high chemical reactivity, the fluorine&#8208;stabilized defective black phosphorene as a nitrogen reduction electrocatalyst induces a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8722;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8722;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions. Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8722;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8722;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is demonstrated as an innovative co&#8208;reactant in the luminol electrochemiluminescence system for the first time. Cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide serves as an advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of water for the generation of reactive oxygen species, achieving the enhancement of electrochemiluminescence emission for sensitive biosensing.







Abstract
In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering towards a high&#8208;quality SEI regulates Li plating on graphite anode with a high reversibility and uniform morphology during fast&#8208;charging. This work provides a novel strategy to address the Li plating issue for fast&#8208;charging batteries.







Abstract
The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40&#8201;% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%) throughout 240&#8197;cycles and a 99.95&#8201;% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4&#8201;% even at 7.2&#8197;A (6&#8197;C) after 150&#8197;cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.

Dense, smooth, substrate&#8208;integrated, large&#8208;area and thickness&#8208;controlled perovskite microcrystalline films are prepared. They are used as self&#8208;powered microcrystalline X&#8208;ray detectors with an impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which may further reduce the X&#8208;ray radiation risk to patients.







Abstract
Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generated H2O2 from O2 electroreduction over mesoporous carbon is applied to oxidize ethylene via titanium silicalite&#8208;1. The in situ generated &#8901;OOH on the mesoporous carbon can form the key active species Ti&#8208;OOH over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 and oxidize ethylene. This route exhibits outstanding production rate and selectivity of ethylene glycol.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1 catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86&#8201;% H2O2 conversion with 99&#8201;% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48&#8197;mmol&#8201;gecat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2 as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2 over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H2O2 in tandem route.

         <title>Peripherally Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated Strategy Towards High&#8208;Performance Pure Green Electroluminescence with External Quantum Efficiency over 40&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve both large rate of reverse intersystem crossing and narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters by heavy&#8208;atom effect is proposed by peripherally decorating the MR&#8208;skeleton with selenoxanthone. External quantum efficiency (EQE) above 40&#8201;%, Commission Internationale de l'Echairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.19, 0.70) and reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom integration into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule could significantly promote the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. However, simultaneously achieving high efficiency, small roll&#8208;off, narrowband emission and good operational lifetime remains a big challenge for the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we report a pure green multi&#8208;resonance TADF molecule BN&#8208;STO by introducing a peripheral heavy atom selenium onto the parent BN&#8208;Cz molecule. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode device based on BN&#8208;STO exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.1&#8201;%, power efficiency (PE) of 176.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, well&#8208;suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and pure green gamut. This work reveals a feasible strategy to reach a balance between fast RISC process and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of MR&#8208;TADF by heavy atom effect.

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching among different anchoring sites of single&#8208;molecule junctions was achieved by mechanical tuning, leading to the control of the transmission pathway between the destructive quantum interference (DQI) and the constructive quantum interference (CQI) at the single&#8208;molecule level, which provides a new strategy for designing molecular electromechanics devices.







Abstract
The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6&#8197;nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.

         <title>A Complete Triad of Zero&#8208;Valent 17&#8208;Electron Monoradicals of Group 7 Elements Stabilized by m&#8208;Terphenyl Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally analogous monomeric manganese(0), technetium(0) and rhenium(0) monoradicals has been stabilized by means of sterically encumbered m&#8208;terphenyl isocyanides. They possess square&#8208;pyramidal structures. Their electron spin of S=
 allows the detection of resolved EPR spectra. High field EPR (Q band and W band) is shown to be a valuable tool for a complete analysis of the tensor components of the manganese compound.







Abstract
The first consistent series of mononuclear 17&#8208;electron complexes of three Group 7 elements has been isolated in crystalline form and studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The paramagnetic compounds have a composition of [M0(CO)(CNp&#8208;F&#8208;ArDArF2)4] (M=Mn, Tc, Re; ArDArF2=2,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)2C6H2F) and are stabilized by four sterically encumbering isocyanides, which prevent the metalloradicals from dimerization. They have a square pyramidal structure with the carbonyl ligands as apexes. The frozen&#8208;solution EPR spectra of the rhenium and technetium compounds are clearly anisotropic with large 99Tc and 185,187Re hyperfine interactions for one component. High&#8208;field EPR (Q band and W band) has been applied for the elucidation of the EPR parameters of the manganese(0) complex.

An efficient method has been developed for the asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to give chiral indolines and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides in high product yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions, as reported by Li Dang, Yungen Liu, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218577). This method provides a complementary approach to asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H aminations by precious metal&#8208;based catalysis.

Rock&#8208;solid amyloid?. Aromatic residues in the core of the amyloid fibrils HELLF and HET&#8208;s show no sign&#160;of ring flips suggesting a rigid core that does not undergo "breathing motions". Aromatic residues facing outside on the other hand are highly flexible and show ring flips on various timescales. These conclusions could be drawn from dynamics measurements by solid&#8208;state MAS NMR in combination with specific labeling of phenylalanines and tyrosines as Paul Schanda&#160;et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (e202219314).

Non&#8208;covalent interaction modulation is a promising strategy to guide the design of applicable (supra)molecular electronics. A rare investigation of the relationship between host&#8211;guest interaction and supramolecular charge transport is reported by Cunlan Guo, Shigui Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202216987). The current density through the pillar[5]arenes&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers can be raised up to ~2.1 orders of magnitude after the introduction of cationic guest molecules, providing a new route for the design of molecular electronic devices and functional sensors with tunable electronic components.

Regulation of dynamic chirality and conversion of the regulated dynamic chirality to static chirality is challenging and important for their applications. In their Research Article (e202217971), Tomoki Ogoshi and co&#8208;workers report the control and amplification of dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arene by guest solvents and crystallization, respectively. The regulated dynamic chirality was changed to static chirality by introducing bulky stoppers. The image shows the conversion of the dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;static planar chirality in pillar[5]arenes (cars) by introducing bulky stoppers (pit stop).

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Carbon Monoxide: Ketenyl Anions by PPh3/CO Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent findings reported by Gessner and co&#8208;workers in the synthesis of valuable ketenyl anions by an exchange of triphenylphosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide. The metal ketenyl/ynolate was structurally characterized and used as a reagent in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Ketenes (R2C=C=O) are important reactive intermediates in organic chemistry which are often challenging to access in stable form due to their polarized cumulenic structure and inherent high reactivity. Ketenyl anions (R(M)C=C=O) or metal ynolates (R&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;OM) represent alternative, highly attractive synthetic targets, but are typically prepared in situ and their structure and synthetic access are little investigated. Now, a fundamentally new strategy utilizing an exchange reaction of a phosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide gives rise to a series of novel ketenyl anions. These compounds are flexible reagents and can easily be transferred with electrophiles into more complex building blocks for synthetic applications. Since carbon monoxide is an inexpensive C1 building block, the new exchange strategy is an elegant concept and a valuable new entry in the synthetic toolbox of organic synthesis.

         <title>Selective Ion Transport in Two&#8208;Dimensional Lamellar Nanochannel Membranes</title>

         <dc:description>
Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for versatile applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. Permselective membranes constructed from parallel stacked 2D nanosheets have recently aroused great research enthusiasm because interior nanochannels with unprecedented diversity could be accurately designed and efficiently modulated.







Abstract
Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for many applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. The development of a permselective lamellar membrane constructed from parallel stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets opened a new avenue for the development of next&#8208;generation separation technology because of the unprecedented diversity of the designable interior nanochannels. In this Review, we first discuss the construction of homo&#8208; and heterolaminar nanoarchitectures from the starting materials to the emerging preparation strategies. We then explore the property&#8211;performance relationships, with a particular emphasis on the effects of physical structural features, chemical properties, and external environment stimuli on ion transport behavior under nanoconfinement. We also present existing and potential applications of 2D membranes in desalination, ion recovery, and energy conversion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outline research directions in this promising field.

Dinitrogen activation and addition to unsaturated substrates such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes mediated by transition metal complexes efficiently afford a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products.







Abstract
Dinitrogen (N2) activation and functionalization is of fundamental interest and practical importance. This review focuses on N2 activation and addition to unsaturated substrates, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, heteroallenes, aldehydes, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes, mediated by transition metal complexes, which afforded a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products. Emphases are placed on the reaction modes and mechanisms. We hope that this work would stimulate further explorations in this challenging field.

         <title>Operando Stability of Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are among the most intriguing electrocatalysts with maximized material efficiency. For their viable application in industry, the next challenge is ensuring their long&#8208;term stability. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in understanding the operational stability of SACs and provides an outlook for their future developments.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are appealing next&#8208;generation catalysts for various electrochemical technologies. Along with significant breakthroughs in their initial activity, SACs now face the next challenge for their viable applications, insufficient operational stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the current knowledge of SAC degradation mechanisms mainly based on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SACs, some of the most investigated SACs. Recent studies on isolated metal, ligand, and support degradations are introduced, and the underlying fundamentals of each degradation path are categorized into active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) losses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the future outlook of stable SACs.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The powerful electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques are employed to detect reaction intermediates. Based on the detected intermediates, the associative mechanism with the addition of hydroxyl at distal N (distal mechanism) is deduced for nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR).







Abstract
As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8722; bending, NO3&#8722; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8722;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.

         <title>Excessive Iodine Enabled Ultrathin Inorganic Perovskite Growth at the Liquid&#8208;Air Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin inorganic perovskite nanosheets are prepared by liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis by adding only iodine into the precursor solution. The thickness, lateral size, defects, optical and optoelectronic properties of these freestanding materials are optimized by simply adjusting the iodine concentration of the solution.







Abstract
The liquid&#8208;air interface offers a platform for the in&#8208;plane growth of free&#8208;standing materials. However, it is rarely used for inorganic perovskites and ultrathin non&#8208;layered perovskites. Herein the liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanosheets (Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9) is achieved simply by drop&#8208;casting the precursor solution with only the addition of iodine. The products are inaccessible without iodine addition. The thickness and lateral size of these nanosheets can be adjusted through the iodine concentration. The high volatility of the iodine spontaneously drives precursors that normally stay in the liquid to the liquid&#8208;air interface. The iodine also repairs in situ iodine vacancies during perovskite growth, giving enhanced optical and optoelectronic properties. The liquid&#8208;air interfacial growth of ultrathin perovskites provides multi&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom for constructing perovskite&#8208;based heterostructures and devices at atomic scale.

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Ga Sites by Pt Dopant in Low&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent geometric features are identified within low&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;metal catalysts that may provide active sites for the reaction catalysis. Furthermore, Ga atoms can play a key role in the catalysis mechanism due to an altered electronic structure resulting from the dopant atom and the stochastic nature of the liquid.







Abstract
Liquid GaPt catalysts with Pt concentrations as low as 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;atomic&#8201;% have recently been identified as highly active for the oxidation of methanol and pyrogallol under mild reaction conditions. However, almost nothing is known about how liquid state catalysts support these significant improvements in activity. Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine GaPt catalysts in isolation and interacting with adsorbates. We find that persistent geometric features can exist in the liquid state, given the correct environment. We postulate that the Pt dopant may not be limited to direct involvement in catalysis of reactions, but rather that its presence can also enable Ga atoms to become catalytically active.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Sum&#8208;Frequency&#8208;Generation Spectroscopy for In Situ Tracking of Nanoparticle Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO was employed to characterize the morphology of oxide&#8208;supported Pt and Pd nanoparticles. Via the Issp/Ippp ratio, the orientation of CO relative to the macroscopic surface normal reveals the abundance of inclined/curved facets.







Abstract
The surface structure of oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles can be determined via characteristic vibrations of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO. Usually, spectroscopic studies focus on peak position and intensity, which are related to binding geometries and number of adsorption sites, respectively. Employing two differently prepared model catalysts, it is demonstrated that polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals the average surface structure and shape of the nanoparticles. SFG results for different particle sizes and morphologies are compared to direct real&#8208;space structure analysis by TEM and STM. The described feature of SFG could be used to monitor particle restructuring in situ and may be a valuable tool for operando catalysis.

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the localized negatively charged surface with C&#8208;affinity is superior to the positively charged one with O&#8208;affinity, providing guidance for screening and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13&#8197;times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion also applies to Cu&#8722;Bi and Cu&#8722;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive (Hetero)Arylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides have been uncovered with a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach complements the traditional strategy using preformed organometallic reagents, and it exhibits good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl organometallic reagents to imines has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for the formation of optically active diarylmethylamines. Here, we report the first asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides enabled by a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach shows good functional group compatibility and complements the reported strategy without use of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic investigations supported that aryl&#8208;cobalt, instead of an arylzinc reagent, was formed in situ in this reductive aryl&#8208;addition event.

         <title>Intramolecular Ynamide&#8211;Benzyne (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions involving benzyne and ynamides as three&#8208;atom components have been accomplished through the utilization of benzyne precursors having a linking functionality. The ambivalent nature of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom, is thus brought to light in this approach.







Abstract
We report herein intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions between ynamides as three&#8208;atom components and benzyne. In these intramolecular reactions, the two&#8208;bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that contain a chlorosilyl group as a linking functionality. This method thus highlights the ambivalent character of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom.

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circumcoronenes were finally obtained by solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolated in crystalline form. The Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers or alkynes was employed as the key reaction. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations confirmed a structure with seven aromatic sextets and six localized K&#8208;region double bonds.







Abstract
Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;Layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ionic conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) was observed in the 2D&#8208;Ti&#8208;dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H2O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li+ and H+ diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H2O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.







Abstract
Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8722;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963;&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.

         <title>Electrochemical CaC2&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Biochar to C2H2: High Carbon Efficiency and Low Contamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid cathode electrolysis in molten salts is expected to convert biomass carbon into CaC2 with 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency. Simultaneously, the electrolysis can remove elements such as S and P from biomass, circumventing the contamination of harmful H2S and H3P in the final hydrolytic C2H2 product.







Abstract
The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100&#8201;%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973&#8197;K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.

         <title>Catalytic Homologation&#8208;Allylboration Sequence for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Fluorohydrins with Tertiary Fluoride Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrins with tertiary fluoride stereocenters can be obtained via catalytic homologation and allylboration sequence with stereoselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. By allylboration of ketones, the process can also be used to access compounds with adjacent tertiary C&#8722;F and C&#8722;O stereocenters.







Abstract
Homologation of trisubstituted fluoroalkenes followed by allylboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates is suitable for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrin and amine products. In the presence of (R)&#8208;iodo&#8208;BINOL catalyst enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% can be achieved by formation of a single stereoisomer with adjacent stereocenters, of which one is a tertiary C&#8722;F center.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine&#8208;Derived Diazoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes based on a pyridine backbone are accessible via dinitrogen transfer from azides. This fundamentally new substance class features the lowest C&#8722;C bond polarization of the few known stable diazoalkenes, therefore representing best the presentation R2C=C=N2. Photochemically triggered loss of N2 represents a new strategy to access C4 cumulenes.







Abstract
Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz&#8208;type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2&#8208;pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen affording cumulenes and not C&#8722;H insertion products. Pyridine&#8208;derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.

         <title>Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;&#8208;Rich Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalene, a shape&#8208;shifting molecular cage, is incorporated into a pi&#8208;rich polymer backbone to modulate chain architecture. Stochastic bullvalene isomers within the backbone lead to a kinked chain architecture and decreased thermal transitions that are tunable based on percent bullvalene incorporation.







Abstract
The synthesis and processing of &#960;&#8208;rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape&#8208;shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;&#8208;rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self&#8208;contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(p&#8208;phenylene). By varying the amount of bullvalene incorporation within a poly(p&#8208;phenylene) chain (0&#8211;50&#8201;%), we can tune thermal properties and solution&#8208;state conformation. These features are caused by stochastic bullvalene isomers within the polymer backbone that result in kinked architectures. Synthetically, bullvalene incorporation offers a facile method to decrease structural rigidity within &#960;&#8208;rich materials without concomitant crystallization. VT&#8197;NMR experiments confirm that these materials remain dynamic in solution, offering the opportunity for future stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>Superhydrophobic and Conductive Wire Membrane for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic, conductive and hierarchical wire (CuO/F/C(w)) membrane composed of porous core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is fabricated by a facile electrospinning strategy. Advantageous features of this membrane electrode including maximized triple&#8208;phase interfaces on highly exposed CuO. Good conductivity and hierarchical architecture enable adequate CO2 supply and effective electron/mass transfer, and afford numerous active sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPI) are essential for promoting electrochemical CO2 reduction, but it remains challenging to maximize their efficiency while integrating other desirable properties conducive to electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the elaborate design and fabrication of a superhydrophobic, conductive, and hierarchical wire membrane in which core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are integrated into a wire structure (designated as CuO/F/C(w); F, PTFE; C, CNT; w, wire) to maximize their respective functions. The realized architecture allows almost all CuO nanospheres to be exposed with effective TPI and good contact to conductive CNT, thus increasing the local CO2 concentration on the CuO surface and enabling fast electron/mass transfer. As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8&#8201;% and a partial current density of 68.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for multicarbon products at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H&#8208;type cell, far exceeding 10.1&#8201;% and 13.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for bare CuO.

As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8&#8201;% and a partial current density of 68.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for multicarbon products at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H-type cell, far exceeding 10.1&#8201;% and 13.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for bare CuO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diazoalkenes &#8211; From an Elusive Intermediate to a Stable Substance Class in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over decades diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) were postulated as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry even though their direct spectroscopic detection proved very challenging. In the 1970/80ies several groups probed their existence mainly indirectly by trapping experiments or directly by matrix&#8208;isolation studies. In 2021, our group and the Severin group reported independently the synthesis and characterization of the first room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes, which initiated a rapidly expanding research field. Up to now four different classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic substituted room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes have been reported. Their properties and unique reactivity, such as N2/CO exchange or utilization as vinylidene precursors in organic and transition metal chemistry are presented. This review summarizes the early discoveries of diazoalkenes from their initial postulation as transient, elusive species up to the recent findings of the room&#8208;temperature stable derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Construction of Three&#8208;Dimensional Protein Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein crystallization is an important tool for structural biology and nanostructure preparation. Here, we report on kinetic pathway&#8208;dependent protein crystals that are controlled by light. Photo&#8208;responsive crystallites are obtained by complexing the model proteins with cationic azobenzene dyes. The crystalline state is readily switched to a dispersed phase under ultra&#8208;violet light and restored by subsequent visible light illumination. The switching can be reversibly repeated for multiple cycles without noticeable structure deterioration. Importantly, the photo treatment not only significantly increases the crystallinity, but creates crystallites at conditions where no ordered lattices are observed upon directly mixing the components. Further control over the azobenzene isomerization kinetics produces protein single crystals of up to ~50 &#956;m. This approach offers an intriguing method to fabricate metamaterials and study optically controlled crystallization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple, Selective, and General Catalyst for Ring Closing Depolymerization of Polyesters and Polycarbonates for Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl2 and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (Tc &gt;200 &#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl2 per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol). In addition to being general for a wide variety of polyesters and polycarbonates, the catalyst system could selectively depolymerize a polyester in the presence of other commodity plastics, demonstrating how reactive distillation using the ZnCl2/PEG600 catalyst system can be used to separate mixed plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Insertion of Alkenes Into C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds Mediated by Fluorine&#8208;Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &#945;&#8208;fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the gem&#8208;difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one&#8208;pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57 kW/kg over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14 kW/kg with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbon belts have drawn great attention because of their unique structures and tantalizing properties. Although a few belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have been synthesized, belt molecules containing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain rare. Herein we report the construction and application of unprecedented zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis features fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions of resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived intermediates, which affords C4&#8208;symmetric tetrabenzobelt[4]arene[4]cyclooctatrienones. Stereoselective ketone reduction with LiAlH4 and nucleophilic addition with alkynyllithiums provide the corresponding tetrahydroxylated belts. The tetraol and its methyl ether are powerful and selective hosts to form 2:1 and 1:1 complexes with cesium ion, respectively, with binding constants up to (1.71&#177;0.33)&#215;1011 M&#8208;2 and (1.50&#177;0.16)&#215;106 M&#8208;1. In addition, enantiopure C4&#8208;symmetric belts can emit CPL with |glum| being around 0.01.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Polyoxoniobates with Photoinduced "D&#8208;f&#8208;A" Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds with redox activities have appealing applications in catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, but the redox inert of polyoxoniobates (PONbs) significantly limits their applications for a long time. In this work, we are able to integrate organophosphate and lanthanide cluster into PONb to create the first family of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. These novel species not only present the first family of redox active PONbs that can be reduced to form long&#8208;lived &#8220;heteropoly blues&#8221; under ambient conditions, but also a new photochromic system. More importantly, the analyses of the electronic configurations and photochromic properties for a series of designed proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PONbs models allow us to discover a D&#8208;f&#8208;A electron transfer mechanism, that is, photoinduced electron is transferred from a photosensitive organophosphate electron donor (D) to the NbV electron acceptor (A) through the unoccupied 4f&#8208;orbitals of Ln (f). This work paves the way for developing diverse PONb&#8208;based redox materials and expanding the possibility of the applications of PONbs in the redox chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of a Dearomatization Route in the Biosynthesis of Oxysporidinone Involving a TenA&#8208;like Cytochrome P450 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dearomatization of phenols is an important transformation for synthesis of complex molecules. Oxysporidinone and related 2&#8208;pyridones are featured with a hydroxy&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone ring, which is proposed from dearomatization of phenol. However, detailed biochemical characterization of this process is still undiscovered. Herein, we identified oxysporidinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum by regulator activation and gene knockout study. Through in vivo and in vitro study, we confirmed that the phenol dearomatization process involves two enzymes. OsdM, as a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 expected with ring&#8208;expansion activity, converts the phenol ring and the 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone core into an unexpected fused [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN, on the other hand, catalyses two successive ene&#8208;reductions, which is followed by hydroxylation via OsdM. This new route enriches current knowledge on enzymatic phenol dearomatization and TenA&#8208;like P450s mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Synthetic Strategies for 1H&#8208;Indazoles and Their N&#8208;Oxides: Electrochemical Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indazole N&#8208;Oxides and Their Divergent C&#8211;H Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and their N&#8208;oxides and the subsequent C&#8211;H functionalization of the 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides are described. The electrochemical outcomes were determined by the nature of the cathode material. When a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode was used, a wide range of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized, and the electrosynthesis products were deoxygenated to N&#8208;heteroaromatics, owing to cathodic cleavage of the N&#8211;O bond via paired electrolysis, while Zn cathode was used. The scope of this electrochemical protocol is broad, as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substrates were tolerated. The potency of our electrochemical strategy was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, making this reaction attractive for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazole derivatives for pharmaceutical research and development. Detailed mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggested a radical pathway featuring iminoxyl radicals. Owing to the rich reactivity of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides, diverse C&#8211;H functionalization reactions were performed. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides by synthesizing the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3); key intermediates for bendazac, benzydamine, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAM&#8208;531, and gamendazole analogues; and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Vacancy Engineering of a Robust ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;MOF for Hexane Isomers Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrimination of physically similar molecules by porous solids represents an important yet challenging task in industrially relevant chemical separations. Precisely controlled pore dimension and/or tailored pore surface functionality are crucial to achieve high&#8208;efficiency separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for these challenging separations in light of their structural diversity as well as highly adjustable pore dimension/functionality. We report here a microporous, ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;based MOF structure, HIAM&#8208;410 (HIAM = Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials), built on hexanuclear Zr6 cluster and pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetracarboxylate (ptc4&#8208;). Its crystallographic structure has been determined using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique combined with Rietveld refinement against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, aided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. The compound features exceptional framework stability that is comparable to the prototype MOF UiO&#8208;66. Interestingly, the linker vacancies in the pristine MOF structure could be partially restored by post&#8208;synthetic liker insertion.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Discrimination of physically similar molecules by porous solids represents an important yet challenging task in industrially relevant chemical separations. Precisely controlled pore dimension and/or tailored pore surface functionality are crucial to achieve high-efficiency separation. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for these challenging separations in light of their structural diversity as well as highly adjustable pore dimension/functionality. We report here a microporous, ftw-type Zr-based MOF structure, HIAM-410 (HIAM = Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials), built on hexanuclear Zr6 cluster and pyrene-1,3,6,8-tetracarboxylate (ptc4-). Its crystallographic structure has been determined using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique combined with Rietveld refinement against powder X-ray diffraction data, aided by low-dose high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. The compound features exceptional framework stability that is comparable to the prototype MOF UiO-66. Interestingly, the linker vacancies in the pristine MOF structure could be partially restored by post-synthetic liker insertion. Its separation capability of hexane isomers is enhanced substantially upon the linker vacancy engineering. The restored structure exhibits efficient splitting of monobranched and dibranched hexane isomers at both room temperature and industrially relevant temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Chiral Tricyclic Lactams by&#160;Tandem Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination/Lactamization Using Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atom&#8208; and step&#8208; efficient synthesis of chiral fused tricyclic lactams from readily available keto esters using cheap ammonium salts as the nitrogen source is reported. This Ru&#8208;catalyzed system operates through an efficient tandem dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA)/lactamization, and produces chiral fused tricyclic lactams in high yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee, &gt;20:1 dr and 98% yield). The robust method is also applied to the concise synthesis of key intermediates of the Rivastigmine analogues and chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven CH4 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products and H2 is attractive but challenging, and the development of efficient catalytic systems is critical. Herein, we construct a solar energy&#8208;driven iron ions redox cycle for combining CH4 conversion and H2 production. A photo&#8208;driven iron&#8208;induced reaction system is developed, which is efficient at selective coupling of CH4 as well as conversion of benzene and cyclohexane under mild conditions. For CH4 conversion, 94% of C2 selectivity and 8.4 &#956;mol h&#8722;1of C2H6 formation rate is achieved. Mechanism studies reveal that CH4 coupling is induced by hydroxyl radical, which is generated by photo&#8208;driven intermolecular charge migration of Fe3+ complex. The delicate coordination structure of [Fe(H2O)5OH]2+ complex ensures the selective C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;C coupling of CH4. The produced Fe2+ can be used to reduce the potential for electrolytic H2 production, and then turns back into Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable recycle system.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1), which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.</dc:description>

As for both selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, the reaction enjoys broad substrate scopes. The present catalytic system is also successfully applied to asymmetric selenation of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. A [Cu&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;TANIAPHOS]&#8208;SePh species is characterized by its 77Se NMR spectra, which gives a chemical shift at &#948; 462 ppm. Moreover, a {[Cu&#8208;(R)&#8208;TOL&#8208;BINAP]&#8208;SePh}2 species is characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, which confirms the formation of Cu&#8208;Se bond in the reaction.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Enantioconvergence and&#160;Kinetic Resolution in the Coupling of Tertiary Cyclobutenols with&#160;Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein discover that a nickel catalytic system with a modified SPINOL (1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol)&#8208;phosphoramidite as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling reaction between tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines to occur in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99.9% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an s factor up to &gt; 200. The reaction employs a free hydroxyl in a strained&#8208;ring system as the leaving group without additional activation and can render the strained&#8208;ring untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to achieve the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Bilateral Disulfurating Reagent for Unsymmetrical Polysulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed a bilateral disulfurating reagent via S&#8211;S motif &#8220;snip and stitch&#8221; processes, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8211;S bonds. The reagent is readily synthesized in high yield using a one&#8211;step reaction from easily available starting materials and is air&#8211;stable. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride were sequentially installed on either side of the S&#8211;S motif. Natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8211;linked with S&#8211;S bonds. Notably, the disulfurating reagent can be used in cyclic disulfide synthesis. At last, some desired products of this work showed good antibacterial activities, which could be employed as novel candidates to control plant pathogenic bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy&#160;to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Phase WO3 Cocatalysts on Hierarchical Si&#8208;based Photocathode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Li Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical lithium (Li)&#160;extraction can be expected to provide a useful recycle of Li+ from waste Li&#8208;containing battery, but the process is limited by the photocathodes with poor Li+ absorption and low yield rate. Here, we have designed a hierarchical silicon (Si)&#8208;based photocathode with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide (WO3)&#160;cocatalysts for photoelectrochemical Li extraction under 1 sun illumination, achieving a high Li yield rate of 223.0 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 91.9% at 0.0817 V versus Li(0/+) redox couple. The WO3 cocatalysts with the mixture of amorphous and crystalline phase accelerates the Li+ insertion and precipitation&#160;and enriches the concentration of Li+ at the photocathode surface. This robust photoelectrochemical Li extraction system provides a new insight on designing green and efficient route for cyclic utilization of Li resources in the sustainable energy field.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of Polyhydroxylated Steroids by an Unsaturation&#8208;Functionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oxygenated cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain possess a wide spectrum of biological functions and remain significant synthetic challenges. Herein we have applied an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy and developed a synthetic method in addressing the C19&#8208;hydroxylation issue for efficient synthesis of polyhydroxylated steroids. An effective asymmetric dearomative cyclization allowed the construction of the C19&#8208;hydroxy unsaturated steroidal skeleton in only 4 steps from the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal 7. A synthetic sequence featured C3&#8208;OH directed hydrogenation/epoxidation, m&#8208;CPBA triggered epoxidation/S N 2&#8217; nucleophilic substitution, Birch reduction of enone, and regioselective LiAlH4 reduction furnished the polyhydroxy functionalities on the steroid skeleton in high stereochemical control and efficiency, which has ultimately enabled the&#160;total synthesis of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin in 18 and 19 overall steps, respectively. The syntheses of these polyhydroxylated steroids has offered synthetic versatility and practicality in search for new therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Self&#8208;sustainable Autonomous Locomotions of Light&#8208;driven Seifert Ribbon Actuators based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotions integrated into one individual system, are high&#8208;level intelligent behavioral characteristics of living organisms and are the scientific hotspot of bionic soft actuators. Here, we report a light&#8208;fueled soft actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable movements based on a Seifert ribbon bounded by a Hopf link. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and the actuation component becomes either a discontinuous strip&#8208;like structure or a continuous toroidal structure, which can realize adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions. The two motion modes are applied to the self&#8208;oscillatory piezoelectric generation and self&#8208;rotational work multiplication of cargo transport, respectively. The unique smartness of Seifert surface topology advances the level of actuation intelligence with broad implications for the adaptability, multifunctionality, and autonomy of soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but the tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicine is present at current stage. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed as Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme is featured with multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in the stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozyme to treat hypertension; but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Antioxidant and Prooxidant Nanozymes: From Cellular Redox Regulation to Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity, have attracted tremendous interest in recent years owing to their ability to replace natural enzymes in various biomedical applications. Nanozymes that can regulate the cellular redox status by mimicking the antioxidant enzymes in mammalian cells are of great therapeutic significance in oxidative stress&#8208;mediated disorders. As the distinction of physiological oxidative stress (oxidative eustress) and pathological oxidative stress (oxidative distress) occurs at a fine borderline, it is a great challenge to design nanozymes that can differentially sense the two extremes in cells, tissues and organs and mediate appropriate redox chemical reactions. In this review, we summarize the advances in the development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes and their biomedical applications. We highlight the therapeutic significance of the antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes in various diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>
