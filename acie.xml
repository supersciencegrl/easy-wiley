         <title>An Olefin Radical Based Thiele&#8242;s Hydrocarbon Derivative and Macrocyclic Tetraradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A persistent Thiele&#8242;s hydrocarbon derivative, containing two five&#8208;membered dioxoborocyclic monoradical units bridged by a p&#8208;phenylene, was generated. It exhibits an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a large singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap. A macrocyclic molecule, composed of two units of the Thiele&#8242;s hydrocarbon derivative, was also prepared. The macrocyclic molecule possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state but with considerable tetraradical character. The diradical and tetraradical compounds can be viewed as a zwitterionic species containing olefin radical cations. These newly formed compounds are stable both in the solid state and solution under inert atmosphere for several days. They have been fully investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, EPR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and SQUID measurements, as well as theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(allenamer)s by Powerful Cyclic&#8211;Alkyl&#8211;Amino&#8211;Carbene (CAAC) Ruthenium Catalysts and Facile Post&#8208;modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic polymers are very attractive due to their unique properties, however so far, have simple and less reactive backbone structures due to synthetic limitations, restricting their further post&#8208;modification. Notably, allenes present a potentially useful platform in polymer chemistry due to their well&#8208;established toolbox in organic chemistry. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge remains in synthesizing poly(allenamer)s with high allene contents or polymerization efficiency, as well as synthesizing different types of cyclic poly(allenamer)s. Herein, we synthesized linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s via ring&#8211;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring&#8211;expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP), employing highly efficient cyclic&#8211;alkyl&#8211;amino&#8211;carbene (CAAC) ruthenium catalysts. Mechanistic studies suggested CAAC ligands enhanced stability of propagating Ru vinylidene, enabling various linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s with turnover number up to 1360 and molecular weight reaching 549 kDa. Their cyclic architecture was thoroughly characterized by multi&#8208;angle light scattering (MALS) SEC with viscometer. Moreover, controlled ROMP of a highly reactive &#945;&#8211;substituted cyclic allene was achieved using third&#8211;generation Grubbs' catalyst. Finally, we demonstrated highly efficient and selective post&#8208;modifications on poly(allenamer)s with primary and secondary alcohols. This broadens the scope of cyclic polymers with improved efficiency and structural control, affording a practical platform for diverse macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Polysulfide Solvation Structure on Electrical Double Layer Chemistry in Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are garnering attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges, such as the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS) and dendrite growth. The high solubility of NaPS in the electrolyte is particularly problematic. It disrupts electron transfer and obstructs mass transport in the electrical double layer (EDL) region. The EDL plays a pivotal role governing the interfacial chemistry between the electrode and electrolyte, significantly impacting the overall electrochemical performance. Through simulations and experimental screening of various solvents, including 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and tetrahydropyran (THP), along with ethyl 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl ether (ETFE) as a diluent, the relationship between NaPS solvation structure and EDL chemistry has been elucidated. Our findings reveal that THP&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) not only reduces the solubility of NaPS by altering its solvation structure, but also promotes the formation of a stable inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and improves compatibility with sodium metal. Consequently, Na&#8208;S batteries with LHCE&#8208;THP/ETFE exhibit long&#8208;term stability over 500 cycles at 1C rate with a capacity decay rate of only 0.07% per cycle. This study provides a methodology for designing electrolytes based on molecular structure, polysulfides solvation properties, and EDL interfacial chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>An ultra robust tough, stretchable, and super high elastic recovery supramolecular elastomer resulting from hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction by sp2 hybridized boron&#8208;urethane bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastomers are omnipresent in everyday life and industry, yet the development of an elastomer with both superb stress and toughness presents a prodigious challenge. In this report, a high&#8208;strength, tough, and high&#8208;elastic elastomer derived from sp2 hybrid orbitals of phenylboronic acid was designed. The spatial conformation of network becomes significantly more compact due to the sp2 hybridization of boron. This enhances supramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, resulting in a marked improvement in the material&#8217;s mechanical properties. Notably, the hydrogen bonding energy in the polyurethane chain segments enhanced by 37%. The robust hydrogen bonding imparts the elastomer with super high true stress (1.30 GPa), superior toughness (442.2 MJ&#183;m&#8208;3), and super puncture resistance strength of 167.8 N&#183;mm&#8208;1. The material exhibited excellent fatigue resistance during continuous tensile cycles, while the irreversible deformation disappeared after standing at room temperature. Moreover, the elastomer bespeaks extraordinary elastic restorability, swiftly reverting to its primitive length after being extended to 16 times. This work provides a strategy that the mechanical properties of materials can be enhanced and toughened by utilizing spatial conformational changes in intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Sb&#8208;N Coordination Enables Record&#8208;High Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high birefringence in ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;transparent crystals has remained a significant challenge due to the absence of systematic design methodologies. Herein, we present a novel organic&#8208;inorganic coordination strategy that combines &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands ([C12H8N2]) with inorganic Sb&#8208;based polyhedra featuring stereochemically active lone pairs. This approach facilitates the formation of the first coplanar double Sb&#8208;N coordination framework, enabling the synthesis of two new birefringent hybrid crystals: (C12H8N2)SbF2(H2PO3) (PNSP) and (C12H8N2)SbF3 (PNSF). Notably, PNSF demonstrates an unprecedented birefringence of 0.79 at 546 nm, exceeding all known UV&#8208;transparent birefringent materials to date. These results not only expand the performance limits of birefringent hybrid crystals but also emphasize the pivotal role of stereochemically induced anisotropy in manipulating optical properties. Our study establishes a solid foundation for the rational design of next&#8208;generation optical materials, offering significant advancements for applications in cutting&#8208;edge photonic technologies, including UV polarizers and optical modulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Transaminase&#8208;Triggered Cascades for the Synthesis and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis is now a well&#8208;established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone to an amine or alcohol, and do not result in the generation of significant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme&#8208;triggered reaction cascade methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3&#8208;rich molecules in one step. Herein, we describe a single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to high&#8208;value, complex indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies on a transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural product&#8208;like N&#8208;heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N&#8208;heterocycles and where a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3&#8208;rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.</dc:description>

This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural product-like N-heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme-triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N-heterocycles and where a retro-double intramolecular aza-Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3-rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding and Tuning Singlet&#8208;Triplet (S1/T1) Energy Gaps in Planar Organic Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with large gaps between their first singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) are key components of various modern technologies, most prominently singlet fission photovoltaics and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. The design of these molecules is hampered by the fact that only limited rules for maximizing &#916;EST exist, other than increasing the overlap between the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO). Here we suggest a new strategy for tuning and maximizing &#916;EST based on a detailed analysis of the underlying quantum mechanical energy terms. We present a model based on the transition density and derive three straightforward design rules: &#916;EST values can be maximized by (i) minimizing the overall number of &#960;&#8208;electrons, (ii) reducing delocalization, and (iii) optimizing specific geometric interactions. The validity of these rules is first exemplified for a set of 18 hydrocarbon backbones before proceeding to a varied set of dye molecules highlighting their transferability to realistic settings. We believe that the developed rules will provide an enormous boost to the field enabling rational design instead of trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of going beyond the FMO approximation in designing advanced molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanostructure Monolayers as SERS Substrates for Ultrasensitive Detection of Enantiomer Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive and specific biomarkers are needed for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, a new type of chiral gold nanostructure induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;leucine dipeptides&#160;with a g&#8208;factor of 0.1&#160;was successfully synthesized. To enhance the discrimination performance, the chiral gold nanostructures&#160;were assembled into D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers.&#160;As surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, the&#160;D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers simultaneously deliver&#160;molecular structural specificity and enantioselectivity within a single spectrum, which can be&#160;a versatile, label&#8208;free chiral discrimination strategy for the detection of D&#8208;/L&#8208;kynurenine&#160;(Kyn). The mechanism was unveiled to involve high enantioselective adsorption energies between L&#8208; and D&#8208;Kyn on the lattice plane (221), resulting in enantioselective sensing.&#160;The results showed that L&#8208;Au monolayer&#160;reached a limit of detection (LOD)&#160;of 3.7 nM for&#160;L&#8208;Kyn,&#160;while D&#8208;Au monolayer&#160;reached a&#160;LOD of 3.6 nM&#160;for&#160;D&#8208;Kyn, respectively.&#160;Notably, there was a&#160;significant difference in D&#8208;Kyn&#160;levels&#160;between AD patients and healthy individuals in serum samples, a distinction not observed for L&#8208;Kyn, which&#160;positioned D&#8208;Kyn&#160;as a potential novel biomarker for clinical&#160;prediagnosis&#160;of AD patients, marking the first report of its kind worldwide.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Ensembled Aptamers Enhance Fluid Stability in Circulating Tumor Cells Capture for Tumor Treatment Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) engineered multivalent aptamers (TEAn) with programmable ligands size and configuration, enabling high&#8208;efficiency capture of CTCs and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) clusters on cell membrane.








Abstract
The recognition and binding via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions on cell membranes often weaken in complex environments, such as whole blood samples from cancer patients, making disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation unfavorable. Constructing multivalent ligands with sufficient fluid stability in complex environments remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) ensembled multivalent aptamers (TEAn, n = 1&#8211;3) with programmable ligands size, enabling efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on cell membrane. Compared to traditional aptamer approach, the dissociation constants (Kd) of TEA3 exhibits &#8764;20&#8208;fold growth in serum due to its precise size and rigid DNA framework. This high&#8208;affinity interaction significantly enhances capture efficiency by improving fluid stability of TEAn and magnetic beads complex in complex environment. In addition, this CTC detection strategy is applied for clinical tumor treatment evaluation and progress monitoring in liver cancer patient samples, achieving an accuracy of &#8764;83.3% in classifying patients as complete or partial responses (CR/PR). Overall, this strategy will strongly promote potential clinical application of DNA framework for cancer diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.

         <title>Synthesis of Abiotic Supramolecular Polymers Inside Living Cells via Organocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells execute mesmerizing functions using supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed through the self&#8208;assembly of biological precursors. Integration of the vast array of synthetic SPs with living cells would offer a powerful way to remold cellular functions and bridge the gap between synthetic materials and biological realm, yet remains a challenge because of the lack of robust abiotic SP systems that can be triggered to self&#8208;assemble inside cells. Here, we report how fully abiotic SPs can be synthesized inside living cells via an organocatalysis&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly strategy, and how the in situ&#8208;generated SPs are capable of interfering with cellular functions. The incorporation of a nucleophilic organocatalyst (CAT) into living cells accelerates the intracellular conversion of hydrazide (H) and aldehyde&#8208;derived precursors (A) to hydrazone&#8208;based monomers (HA3) that locally self&#8208;assemble into SPs. Interestingly, the in situ&#8208;generated SPs possess ignorable effects on cell viability and proliferation but remarkably hinder the cell migration. Furthermore, the presence of SPs is found to retard intracellular diffusion and alter the organization of actin cytoskeleton, both of which are suggested to be responsible for the hindered cellular migration. In considering of the vastly wide range of synthetic SPs, tremendous non&#8208;natural cellular functionalities can be obtained by in situ&#8208;synthesizing SPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Aggregation State to Achieve Low&#8208;Temperature Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

By optimizing the solvent chemistry, the aggregation states have been disrupted, leading to the formation of contact ion pairs within weakly solvating electrolytes. This approach effectively isolates the solvation structure, reducing interactions between structures. Consequently, it maintains a favorable low desolvation energy barrier and anions&#8208;driven SEI. Simultaneously, it enhances ion migration kinetics, enabling fast charging at low temperatures.







Abstract
Insufficient ionic conductivity and elevated desolvation energy barrier of electrolytes limit the low&#8208;temperature applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Weakly solvating electrolytes (WSEs), with limited lithium salt dissociation capability, are prone to desolvate and drive anion&#8208;rich aggregates (AGGs). However, significant AGGs result in increased viscosity and low ionic mobility, contributing to battery failure at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we propose and achieve a transformation of WSEs&#8217; solvation structures from AGGs to contact ion pairs (CIPs) through modulating the overall solvation capability, thereby achieving the balance between weak Li+&#8208; solvent interactions and desired ion migration kinetics. Remarkably, CIPs&#8208;dominated electrolyte shows a ten&#8208;fold increase in ionic conductivity compared to conventional WSEs. The Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) battery achieves more than 1400 cycles with 86.9&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C. The practical 1.2&#8197;Ah LFP pouch cell delivered 69&#8201;% of the capacity at 25&#8201;&#176;C when cycled at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy for solvation structure transformation in WSEs provides a novel approach for the development of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Divergent Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Sulfated Ganglio&#8208;Oligosaccharides for Probing Ligand Requirements of Glycan Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of orthogonal protected tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharides combined with chemical sulfation and enzymatic sialylations gave a panel of sulfated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides that were printed as microarray and screened for binding to lectins, glycan binding proteins, and antibodies. It revealed that sulfation modulates recognition in complex manners.







Abstract
Sulfoglycolipids are an important class of acidic glycosphingolipids that have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes. Little is known about the interactome of sulfated gangliosides, and it is not well understood how a possible interplay between sialylation and sulfation influences molecular recognition. Here, we describe a chemoenzymatic strategy that readily provided a panel of twenty&#8208;one sulfated and sialylated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide that are equipped with the orthogonal protecting groups allyloxycarbonate (Alloc), levulinate ester (Lev) and t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBS). Selective removal of one or more protecting groups followed by sulfation of the resulting alcohol(s) and deprotecting gave several ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. Compound lacking an internal sialic acid could be prepared by exposing several derivatives to a sialidase. Compounds having an unmodified terminal galactoside could enzymatically be sialylated to give hybrid structures, which could be further extended to provide 2,8&#8208;sialosides. The synthetic glycans were printed as a microarray which was used to examine ligand requirements of a series of glycan&#8208;binding proteins including antibodies, toxins, galectins and siglecs. It was found that sulfation regulates protein binding in complex manners and in general sulfation and sialylation of C&#8208;3 of the terminal Gal influences protein binding in different ways.

         <title>Regioregular Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane): A Strictly Alternating BN&#8208;Isostere of Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) analogue with a strictly alternating arrangement of BN units along the chain was prepared by an AB&#8208;polymerization process. The polymer and monodisperse oligomers show emission from locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states, respectively, which can be addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.







Abstract
Incorporation of BN units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds, as substitutes for specific CC couples, often leads to new hybrid materials with modified physical and chemical properties. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane)s are derived from well&#8208;known poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by replacement of the vinylene groups by B=N linking units. Herein, an unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane) is presented that features a strictly alternating sequence of BN units along the main chain. The synthesis thereof was achieved by AB&#8208;type polymerization of a monomer featuring an N and a B terminus. Monodisperse oligomers with up to three BN units in the chain were additionally prepared and structurally characterized. Associated with the introduction of a dipole in the regioregular backbone structure, they display notable fluorescence already in solution and large Stokes shifts, distinct from their previously reported BBNN&#8208;sequenced congeners. All compounds show aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties. Computational studies provided evidence for emission from either locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states. These processes can be optionally addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to dual emission, solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.

The low&#8208;dimensional hetero&#8208;interlayer of HQ2ZnI4 acts as the sensitizer actualizing additional near&#8208;infrared photovoltaic conversion, the buffer layer with strong interaction and suitable binding interval, the energy modification interface for facilitating carrier transfer, and the buffer preventing instability decomposition, making devices achieving sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic gain and enhancement in photoelectric performance.







Abstract
Actualizing sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion is effective in remitting energy loss and pushing theoretical efficiency limits for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide based on hydroxyquinoline (HQ) is developed to sensitize PSCs for near&#8208;infrared region gain to implement sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion for enhancing power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. [ZnI4]2&#8722; skeletons containing heavy atoms intensify the direct singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state transition of organic chromophores HQ. Meanwhile, the triplet energy of HQ is close to resonance with perovskite band gap, favoring the energy transfer to perovskite and exciting the additional electron&#8208;hole pairs, which was observed by transient absorption spectroscopy, confirming the sensitization of perovskite to increase sub&#8208;band gap photocurrent. HQ2ZnI4 modifies electronic and crystal structure, optimizes energy&#8208;level arrangement, and acts as a protective layer, realizing considerable PCEs in small (6.25&#8197;mm2)&#8208;/larger&#8208;area (1&#8197;cm2) devices and excellent operational stability. This low&#8208;cost strategy brings vitality to the light management of PSCs and expands low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were first explored by constructing metal sites on the channels of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The inside catalytic sites showed higher catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Pore channels play a decisive role in mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8722;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.

However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under-explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one-dimensional covalent organic frameworks with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8722;Cl breaking and potential-induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside-channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside-channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Nitric Oxide Generation via Thermal Decomposition of N&#8208;Trityl Dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the design and performance of novel nitric oxide donors for gas flow release applications such as inhaled nitric oxide therapies. Dispersions of N&#8208;trityl dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines in hyper cross&#8208;linked polymers are shown to yield consistent gas phase nitric oxide release at therapeutically relevant concentrations and are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a promising therapy for a&#160;variety of pulmonary conditions but is limited by the cost, portability, and safety limitations of the compressed gas cylinders used in conventional iNO delivery systems. On&#8208;demand generation of iNO via thermally controlled decomposition of an NO&#8208;genic precursor is an attractive alternative to systems based on compressed gas cylinders. However, most NO&#8208;releasing materials, which would form the basis of such a system, are designed for in vivo applications, but not for gas flow release at elevated temperatures. Novel NO donors with tunable kinetics suited for simple thermal generation are needed to realize such iNO delivery systems. Here we report the development of a&#160;new class of NO donors based on N&#8208;trityl 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines. We show that amorphous solid dispersions of these molecules in porous polymers exhibit consistent, thermoresponsive NO release in good yields when heated above 90&#8201;&#176;C&#160;in the presence of a carrier gas. We further demonstrate that these donors undergo NO release in aqueous media at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Collectively, this work adds a new class of NO donor to the basis set of known NO&#8208;genic molecules and establishes a potential chemical basis for a low&#8208;power, small&#8208;footprint iNO delivery system.&#160;&#160;

         <title>Monodisperse Chemical Oligophosphorylation of Peptides via Protected Oligophosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more the merrier: Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents enable the concomitant conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (up to hexaphosphate). This simple transformation occurs chemoselectively under mild conditions. This work paves the way for future development of mass spectrometry&#8208;based analytical methods for &#8220;oligophosphoproteomics.&#8221;







Abstract
Protein poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylation are recently discovered post&#8208;translational modifications that remain poorly characterized due to (1) the difficulty of extracting endogenously polyphosphorylated species without degradation and (2) the absence of synthetic and analytical tools to prepare and characterize poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylated species in biochemical contexts. Herein, we report a methodology for the selective oligophosphorylation of peptides with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (Pn=3&#8211;6). A library of oligophosphorimidazolide (oligoP&#8208;imidazolide) reagents featuring benzyl and o&#8208;nitrophenylethyl protecting groups was synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (65&#8211;93&#8201;%). These oligoP&#8208;imidazolide reagents enabled the selective and simultaneous conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphoryl nucleophiles, circumventing tedious iterative processes. The generalizability of this approach is illustrated by a substrate scope study that includes several biologically relevant phosphopeptide sequences, culminating in the synthesis of &gt;60 examples of peptide oligophosphates (Pn=2&#8211;6). Moreover, we report the preparation of oligoP&#8208;diimidazolides (Pn=3&#8211;5) and discuss their application in generating unique condensed phosphate&#8208;peptide conjugates. We also demonstrate that human phospho&#8208;ubiquitin (pS65&#8208;Ub) is amenable to functionalization by our reagents. Overall, we envision the methods described here will enable future studies that characterize these newly discovered but poorly understood phosphorylation modes.

         <title>Degradable Adhesives as Sustainable Alternatives to Acrylics via Ring&#8208;Opening Radical Polymerization of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) using vinylcycloproapne&#8208;based monomers and a crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesion and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs.







Abstract
Acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are loosely crosslinked polymer networks widely used across various industries. However, the network structure and inert nature of the acrylic polymer backbone present sustainability challenges. To address these issues, efforts are being made to incorporate degradable units into the polymer backbone. Yet, two key obstacles remain: i) the polymer does not degrade into sufficiently small fragments, and ii) the adhesive and viscoelastic properties are often inferior to those of conventional acrylic polymers. In this study, we developed a PSA utilizing vinylcyclopropane (VCP)&#8208;based monomers and a VCP&#8208;based crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesive performance and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs. Under optimized polymerization conditions, the polymer incorporates ozone&#8208;labile double bonds into its backbone, enabling controlled molecular degradation without compromising its properties. By synthesizing and strategically combining various VCP&#8208;based monomers, we developed PSAs with tailored adhesion and viscoelastic behavior on par with conventional acrylic PSAs. These advancements indicate that the degradable polymers and PSAs developed in this study are poised for practical application in the near future.

         <title>Enhanced Electroluminescence and Stability of Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive was engineered to regulate crystallization, passivate defects, and resist moisture in blue perovskites using the biomimetic additive 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA). As a result, sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit excellent operational and moisture stability, achieving a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Although remarkable breakthroughs have been witnessed in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), achieving efficient and stable blue PeLEDs still remains as a critical challenge to towards commercial applications. Inspired by the protection effect and water&#8208;repellent properties of swan feathers, 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA) has been designed as adsorbed functional molecule for blue perovskites, which can simultaneously enhance the electroluminescence performance and moisture stability. The HFUA molecule features a long&#8208;chain structure where the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchor, coordinating with undercoordinated lead atoms in blue perovskites. The fluorine atoms at the opposite end of the chain form ionic bonds with the halogen octahedron, thereby stabilizing the octahedral structure. In addition, HFUA adsorption lowers the adsorption energy of organic spacers on the perovskite lattice, optimizing the reduced&#8208;dimensional phase distribution to facilitate smooth exciton transfer. Furthermore, the unique molecular structure of HFUA, rich in fluorine atoms, enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, effectively inhibiting moisture penetration and preventing perovskite hydrolysis. The target blue PeLEDs obtain a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm and exhibit greatly improved air stability under humid and high&#8208;temperature conditions. Our findings provide a unique and effective strategy for producing efficient and stable blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State and Steric Hindrances Engineering Enable Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Narrowband Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Enhanced Quenching Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple donors have been integrated into multi&#8208;resonance moieties to engineer excited states and steric hindrances to generate blue and green thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with enhanced quenching resistance and spin&#8208;flip processes. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show high external quantum efficiencies, reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability across a wide dopant concentration.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials have great potential for applications in ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, that benefit from their narrowband emission characteristic. However, key challenges such as aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and slow triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip process, especially for blue MR&#8208;TADF materials, continue to impede their development due to planar skeletons and relatively large &#916;ESTs. Here, an effective strategy that incorporates multiple carbazole donors into the parent MR moieties is proposed, synergistically engineering their excited states and steric hindrances to enhance both the spin&#8208;flip process and quenching resistance. As expected, the designed materials namely 5Cz&#8208;BNO and 5Cz&#8208;BN exhibit bright blue and green emissions with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) around 23&#8197;nm, together with significantly improved reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. The OLEDs based on 5Cz&#8208;BNO and 5Cz&#8208;BN with doping concentrations from 5 to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values exceeding 30&#8201;% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;offs and improved operational stability. This work offers an effective approach for designing doping&#8208;insensitive blue and green MR&#8208;TADF materials with fast spin&#8208;flip processes by integrating the engineering of excited states and steric hindrances.

         <title>Glucuronidase&#8208;Instructed Glycopeptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells through Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of a glycopeptide induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and apoptosis in cancer cells. This glycopeptide also synergizes with cisplatin and adriamycin to enhance cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer strains.







Abstract
Current cancer treatments face significant challenges, including limited tumor specificity and drug resistance. Enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular peptide assembly targeting lysosomes offers a promising strategy to address these issues; however, self&#8208;assembling units that withstand lysosomal conditions are still scarce. Herein, we present a versatile glycopeptide incorporating glucuronic acid and glucose that undergoes glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form nanofibers, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that in glucuronidase&#8208;overexpressing HepG2 cells, glycopeptide assembly induces cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. The involvement of carbohydrate&#8208;binding receptor in enhancing the cellular entry of glycopeptides and improving proteolytic stability highlights the importance of glycan modification. Notably, combining this glycopeptide with cisplatin or Adriamycin results in synergistic cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer cell lines. These findings establish a novel, LMP&#8208;inducing glycopeptide scaffold for developing targeted approaches for cancer treatment.

         <title>Orthogonal&#8208;Group&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208;Selective I&#8208;Branching of Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine Chains Reveals Unique Binding Specificities of Proteins towards I&#8208;Antigens</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient chemoenzymatic approach was developed to achieve site&#8208;selective I&#8208;branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of which &#8220;caps&#8221; one branching site for selective &#8220;decapping&#8221; and GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. A diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans were prepared from a single precursor. Glycan array analysis then revealed unique recognition of I&#8208;branches.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (poly&#8208;LacNAc) is ubiquitously expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates, serving as the backbone of complex glycans and an extended scaffold that presents diverse glycan epitopes. The branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc, where internal galactose (Gal) residues have &#946;1&#8208;6 linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached, forms the blood group I&#8208;antigen, which is closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes including cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as many of the I&#8208;antigen sequences are undefined and inaccessible. In this study, we developed a highly efficient orthogonal&#8208;group&#8208;controlled approach to access site&#8208;selectively I&#8208;branched poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of them &#8220;caps&#8221; one internal Gal residue of poly&#8208;LacNAc. These groups can be readily &#8220;decapped&#8221; by specific enzymes or chemical reduction to expose desired sites for GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. This approach enabled the rapid preparation of a diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans from a single precursor. Glycan microarray analysis using these complex glycans revealed unique recognitions of I&#8208;branches by lectins, anti&#8208;I mAbs, and galectins. Surprisingly, oxidized forms of linear poly&#8208;LacNAc strongly bound to several glycan&#8208;binding proteins (GBPs). These findings help to bridge the gap in recognition of I&#8208;branching and open new avenues for therapeutic development by targeting galectins.

         <title>Co&#8208;Feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;Supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst effectively facilitates co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran aromatization reactions, preferring the dehydro&#8208;aromatization pathways based on cyclopentenones and alkenes over those based on benzofurans. Additionally, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 enhance the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke.







Abstract
Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97&#8201;%, generating &gt;85&#8201;% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05&#8201;%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3&#8201;% to 8.6&#8201;%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

         <title>Accessing a Carboxyl&#8208;Anhydride Molecular Switch&#8208;Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End&#8208;of&#8208;Use PET</title>

A novel recycling strategy, based on the principles of polycondensation, is proposed for upcycling waste PET to produce high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PECT) containing molecular switches. Upon activation of the molecular switch, PECT undergoes rapid depolymerization to form a prepolymer. Conversely, the prepolymer can be efficiently polymerized back into high molecular weight PECT.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein's molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group. Conversely, activating the molecular switch triggers a ring&#8208;closing reaction that detaches acid anhydrides, bringing about equal molar ratio of groups and thereby facilitating an increase in molecular weight. By simply incorporating a molecular switch into condensation products based on melt polycondensation, closed&#8208;loop recycling capability is achieved without necessitating excessive organic solvents or complex depolymerization processes. The present study not only presents a novel pathway for end&#8208;of&#8208;use PET upcycling but also introduces an innovative concept of molecular switching for the closed&#8208;loop recyclability of condensation polymers, thereby demonstrating significant potential for large&#8208;scale implementation.

         <title>Spatially Preorganized Hybridization Chain Reaction for the Prompt Diagnosis of Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially preorganized hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI&#8208;HCR) enables fast detection of nucleic acid targets. When applied to in vivo imaging of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in mice afflicted with acute gouty arthritis or sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury, TRI&#8208;HCR can diagnose inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination.







Abstract
Biological systems utilize precise spatial organization to facilitate and regulate information transmission within signaling networks. Inspired by this, artificial scaffolds that enable delicate spatial arrangements are desirable to increase the local concentration of reactants, expedite specific interactions, and minimize undesired interference. In this study, we presented an integrated biosensing nanodevice, termed TRI&#8208;HCR, in which hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes were precisely organized on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI) with finely&#8208;tuned distance, quantity, and pattern. Compared to traditional HCR in the free form, this nanodevice demonstrated increased reaction rate and signal level. We further employed the optimized TRI&#8208;HCR for in vivo imaging of a nucleic acid biomarker of inflammatory diseases. In both acute gouty arthritis (AGA) and sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury (SA&#8208;AKI) model mice, TRI&#8208;HCR was capable of diagnosing inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination. We anticipate that this precise spatial preorganization strategy for HCR holds promise for broader applications in early disease detection and monitoring.

         <title>Counterions Determine if Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Convert SO2 to Sulfate or Reversibly Adsorb It</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different counterions modulate the solid&#8208;state SO2 adsorption behavior in M6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (M=Pd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)). Certain anions induce reversible SO2&#8208;adsorption, while nitrate promotes its transformation to sulfate at room temperature. Among these cages, Pd6L8 exhibits the highest cavity&#8208;mediated SO2 conversion, excellent stability, and is quantitatively regenerated.







Abstract
The continuous emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere damages the environment, air quality, and public health worldwide. To mitigate their impact, materials that capture and chemically inactivate gases are required; however, integrating and precisely controlling both abilities within a single material remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that switching between SO2&#8208;physisorption and chemisorption is possible for porous materials by using different counterions, as illustrated with a series of Pd6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs). Pd&#8208;MOCs bearing BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, or SO42&#8722; expressed reversible adsorption (up to 3.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), cyclability, and SO2/CO2 selectivity. NO3&#8722; promoted conversion of SO2 to sulfate, as corroborated with M6L8 cages built on Co(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions. Noteworthy, the nitrate derivative of Pd6L8 captures 6.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 of SO2, cleanly transforms it to SO42&#8722; within its cavity in 94&#8201;% yield at room temperature, it is quantitatively regenerated, and tolerates humid SO2; such qualities are unprecedented for SO2 adsorbents. The deliberate use of counterions for modulating adsorption could be applied to charged MOFs, COFs, or POCs, potentially leading to the development of new reactivity or catalysis pathways for advanced applications against contaminant gases.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Dialdehydes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axially chiral dialdehydes were synthesized via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation. The reaction proceeded smoothly by using chiral amine as the transient directing group. The detailed mechanistic studies implied that an intramolecular C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction might play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Achieving axially chiral biaryl dialdehydes through asymmetric catalysis remains significantly challenging due to the lack of efficient strategies. In this report, we developed a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation through chiral transient directing group strategy. With this new approach, a series of axially chiral amido dialdehydes were achieved in up to 86&#8201;% yields with 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er. Furthermore, detailed mechanistic studies indicated that both the imine formation and C&#8722;H bond cleavage steps were reversible. More interestingly, the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of Int&#8208;2 showed probable C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction between biaryl group and chiral amine moiety. This process offered a convenient route to access axially chiral dialdehyde derivatives. More broadly, it demonstrated a new tool through transient and C&#8722;H/&#960; synergistic interactions, which would stimulate further development of asymmetric catalytic system in enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization.

We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr&#8208;CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Octahedral Lanthanide Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide cages was achieved through amino acid induction, the luminescence asymmetry factor and quantum yield are 0.53 and 61&#8201;%, respectively. The induction ability of amino acid is positively correlated with the number of coordination bonds and coordination bond energies in the precursor formed by amino acid and lanthanide ions.







Abstract
Chiral metal organic cage compounds with excellent circularly polarized luminescent performance have broad application prospects in many fields. Herein, two lanthanide complexes with luminescent properties in the form of racemic hexagonal octahedral cages were synthesized using a tri (&#946;&#8208;diketone) ligand. Eu6(C21H6F15O6)8(H2O)6 exhibited red light emission with high quantum yields of 61&#8201;%. Then, we successfully synthesized lanthanide compounds with circularly polarized luminescent activity by chiral induction of the racemic mixture with arginine. The luminescence asymmetry factor was 0.53, and the circularly polarized luminescent merit figure reached 0.323. High&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescent of racemic cage like compound systems have achieved using cheap and readily available chiral amino acid molecules through chiral induction.

         <title>Multiscale Engineered Bionic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes Breaking the Stiffness&#8208;Damping Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous titania nanotube arrays intertwined with polymer electrolytes accurately replicates the superstructure of tooth enamel, effectively breaking the stiffness&#8208;damping trade&#8208;off, not only inhibiting dendrites growth, but also ensuring electrolyte/electrode mechanical compatibility.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as next&#8208;generation devices for energy storage due to their safety and high energy density. The issues of Li dendrites and poor mechanical compatibility with electrodes present the need for developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high stiffness and damping, but it is a contradictory relationship. Here, inspired by the superstructure of tooth enamel, we develop a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous ceramic nanotube arrays intertwined with solid polymer electrolytes. This bionic electrolyte exhibits both high stiffness (Young&#8242;s modulus=15&#8197;GPa, hardness=0.13&#8197;GPa) and damping (tan&#948;=0.08), breaking the trade&#8208;off. Thus, this composite electrolyte can not only inhibit Li dendrites growth but also ensure intimate contact with electrodes. Meanwhile, it also exhibits considerable Li+ transference number (0.62) and room temperature ionic conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is attributed to oxygen vacancies of the amorphous ceramic effectively decoupling the Li&#8208;TFSI ion pair. Consequently, the assembled Li symmetric battery shows an ultra&#8208;stable cycling (&gt;2000&#8197;hours at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, &gt;500&#8197;hours at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C). Moreover, the LiFePO4/Li and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells both show excellent cycling performance. We demonstrate that this bionic strategy is a promising approach for the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Selection of Plastic&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers for Microplastics Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), a pyrimidine&#8208;rich DNA aptamer was isolated for PVS and PS microplastics, despite their different chemical structures. The high affinity of the aptamer for plastics allowed fluorescence&#8208;based microplastic detection.







Abstract
Plastics are critical materials for modern technological applications, yet environmental contamination by microplastics has become a growing concern. In this study, DNA aptamers were isolated for two of the most abundant plastic materials: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS). These aptamers contain approximately 90&#8201;% cytosine and thymine but only 10&#8201;% purine content. Among them, the PVC&#8208;1 aptamer binds to PVC with a six&#8208;fold higher capacity than a random sequenced DNA. Among the tested plastic materials, PVC and PS exhibited the highest specific binding capacity. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled PVC&#8208;1 aptamer, PS/PVC microplastics as low as 1&#8197;mg were detected, and the aptamer was selective for microplastics over other environmentally relevant materials, such as silica. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aptamer attempted to maximize contact with the plastic surface for adsorption. This plastic&#8208;binding aptamer is expected to find applications in environmental monitoring and has fundamental implications for surface&#8208;binding aptamers.

         <title>Elemental Germanium Activation and Catalysis Enabled by Mechanical Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel method to activate elemental germanium through mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without external reducing agents. We also demonstrate the catalytic activity of elemental germanium for the first time, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes.







Abstract
In the realm of materials science and chemical industry, germanium emerges as a strategic resource with distinctive properties that extend its applicability beyond traditional electronics and optics into the promising field of chemical catalysis. Despite its significant role in advanced technological applications, the potential of elemental germanium as a catalyst remains unexplored. Leveraging recent developments in mechanochemistry, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to activate elemental germanium via mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without the reliance on external reducing agents. Meanwhile, we have also demonstrated, for the first time, the catalytic activity of elemental germanium, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes. These achievements mark a significant advancement in the field of catalysis and open up a new promising avenue for both academic research and industrial applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Level Spatially Localized Proximity Labeling for Cross&#8208;Biological&#8208;Hierarchy Measurement and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a &#8220;two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L)&#8221; platform by cascading galactose oxidase (GAO)&#8208;based oxidation reaction and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;based proximity labeling (PL). P2L integrates enzymatic logic computation and PL, enabling rapid output of spatial localization information across biological hierarchies as covalent tags for cell&#8208;selective assembly programming and microenvironmental proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for the in situ elucidation of biomolecular interaction networks. However, PL methods generally rely on single&#8208;biological&#8208;hierarchy control of spatial localization at the labeling site, which limits their application in multi&#8208;tiered biological systems. Here, we introduced another enzymatic reaction upstream of an enzyme&#8208;based PL reaction and targeted the two enzymes to markers indicating different biological hierarchies, establishing a two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L) platform for in situ molecular measurement and manipulation. Using the cellular&#8208; and glycan&#8208;level as the hierarchical models, we demonstrated the ability of P2L to efficiently execute a two&#8208;step logic operation and to discriminate target cells with different levels of glycosylation within mixed cell populations. By mounting clickable handles via P2L, we reprogrammed the robust covalent assembly of cells at designated sites. The combination of P2L with proteomics led to the profiling of the protein microenvironment of specific glycans on target cells, revealing changes in tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;surface interactions under immune pressure from a glycan perspective. P2L provides not only a solution for revealing the heterogeneity of biological systems, but also new insights in the fields of intelligent logic computation, enzyme engineering, tissue engineering, etc.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Annulation of Silylimines with Olefins to 1&#8208;Aminotetralins Enabled by Diradical Hydrogen Atom Transfer of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated diradical hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines and their subsequent [4+2] annulations with olefins were accomplished via energy transfer. The silyl substituent on the nitrogen atom was crucial for the success of the reaction by modulating the reactivities of the diradical intermediates derived from the excited imines in DHAT and cascade cyclization process.







Abstract
A facile photochemical, one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized 1&#8208;aminotetralins derivatives (&gt;70 examples) from readily accessible o&#8208;alkyl and o&#8208;formyl aryl silylimines with olefins is described. A diradical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines enabled a [4+2] annulation with olefins in excellent diastereoselectivity. This was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the sensitizer via energy transfer. Moreover, sulfur&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkyl silylimines can undergo such photochemical process in the absence of an external photosensitizer. This effective protocol is compatible with a variety of functional groups and can be applied to the modification of bioactive molecules. Based on mechanistic evidences and computational studies, it is suggested that the silyl substituent enables an efficient energy transfer leading to the formation of a key C,N&#8208;diradical and subsequent [4+2]&#8208;cyclization was supported by a better molecular orbital matching between the HSOMO of the 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediate and the LUMO of the olefins. Thus, upon irradiation, the excited silylimine unlocks a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen DHAT and subsequent [4+2] cyclization that allows the divergent functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Quantitative Formation of Octa&#8208;substituted Cyclobutanes by the [2+2] Photocycloaddition of Stiff&#8208;stilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;template strategy has been utilized to generate octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors. The obtained cycloadducts display shape&#8208;persistent geometry and can be reversibly converted into their stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors with a controllable E/Z distribution.







Abstract
The creation of new molecules with specific structural motifs is a primary goal in synthetic chemistry. In this context, cyclobutanes (CBs), the highly strained ring systems, are of great interest because of their wide applications from pharmaceutical chemistry to materials science. The [2+2] photocycloaddition is the most straightforward approach for CBs; however, access to fully substituted cyclobutanes presents a significant challenge due to the steric hindrance imposed by eight substituents. Here, we report an efficient synthesis of structurally unique, octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors, which is enabled by adaptable anion coordination through hydrogen bonding networks. The synthesized spiro&#8208;benzocyclopentyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal structures. DFT calculations indicate that these cyclobutanes have high ring&#8208;strain energies (~20.1&#8197;kcal/mol) and can be completely converted back to stiff&#8208;stilbenes. Such a reversible cycloaddition/reversion process offers a promising platform for applications in responsive and energy storage materials.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of a New Class of Minor Immunosuppressive Plant Sesterterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gracilisoids, a new family of plant sesterterpenoids with highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons (named neo&#8208;eurysolanes), were discovered from Eurysolen gracilis. The collective total synthesis of nine gracilisoid members has been accomplished by employing a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization and late&#8208;stage photo&#8208;oxidation as key steps. Immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was also found.







Abstract
Plant sesterterpenoids are an extremely rare family of natural products that generally possess novel chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented group of minor plant sesterterpenoids, gracilisoids B&#8722;E (2&#8211;5), which feature two types of highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons, along with their biogenetically related precursor gracilisoid A (1), from a Lamiaceae ethnomedicinal plant, Eurysolen gracilis. To confirm their structures and obtain adequate materials for biological research, the asymmetric total syntheses of gracilisoids A&#8722;E (1&#8211;5) and four new biogenetically&#8208;related congeners gracilisoids F&#8722;I (6&#8211;9) were achieved from commercially available (&#8722;)&#8208;citronellal by a bioinspired approach that involves a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization/&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone rearrangement tandem reaction and a late&#8208;stage biomimetic photooxidation as key steps. Biological investigations revealed that gracilisoids A&#8722;I (1&#8211;9) significantly inhibited IFN&#8208;&#947; production and/or T cell proliferation probably through inhibition of the STAT pathway. The findings herald the potential of these gracilisoids as novel immunosuppressive agents, and efficient synthetic approaches will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of their value in future drug development.

         <title>Cooperative Multiscale&#8208;Assembly for Directional and Hierarchical Growth of Highly Oriented Porous Organic Cage Single&#8208;Crystal Microtubes and Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly method for porous organic cages that controls intermolecular interactions and fluid flow across scales, directing the growth of single&#8208;crystal tubular structures with oriented micropores and defined dimensionality. These nanocage&#8208;based architectures enhance chemoenzymatic reactions by compartmentalizing metal clusters and enzymes, offering powerful efficiency in complex catalysis.







Abstract
The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long&#8208;range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double&#8208;solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single&#8208;crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single&#8208;crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro&#8208; and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold enhancement in one&#8208;pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.

         <title>Conformationally Stable and Sterically Hindered Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium Modification of FAPbI3 Enhances the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonium moiety of the conformationally stable dicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium odide presents significant steric hindrance but boasts a high binding energy at the surface of FAPbI3 perovskite. The surface treatment with this salt leads to FAPbI3 film with smoother surface, lower charge trap densities, and higher iodine migration activation energy, ultimately enhancing both power conversion efficiency and operational stability of solar cells.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films frequently exhibit structural defects and impurities that impede the durable operation of solar cells. In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin&#8208;coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The BCPDAI&#8208;treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI&#8208;modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high positive charge density of BCPDA2+ confers greater binding energy at the perovskite surface and elevates the diffusion activation energy of the iodide anion.

         <title>Binder&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Polymerization with Controllable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Transformation in Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate binder&#8208;mediated MOC&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has been developed with tunable viscoelastic behavior and a controllable spontaneous gel&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation process. Adjusting the ratio of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en enables precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal&#8208;organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;&#8208;chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano&#8208; and microscopic structural evolution of a co&#8208;assembled system. Ga&#8208;MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12&#8722;, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni&#8208;ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni&#8208;en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en) co&#8208;assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder&#8242;s ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en, extended through charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product. This study provides an understanding of binder&#8208;mediated control over nanostructural evolution in co&#8208;assembled MOCs.

         <title>Towards Rational Design of Confined Catalysis in Carbon Nanotube by Machine Learning and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that a set of chemical reactions can be accelerated in confined catalysis, while it also negatively suppressed the activity in several cases. In this work, the operando atmosphere of confined catalysis is simulated with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo accelerated by machine learning potential. It was found that compressive strain is a key for confinement effects. This work provides a pathway for the rational design of confined catalysis.







Abstract
The microenvironment is recognized to be as crucial as active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. It was found that the catalytic activity of a set of chemical reactions can be significantly influenced by the confined space of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with some reactions showing superior activity, while others experience a negative impact. The rational design of confined catalysis must rely on the accurate insights of confined microenvironment. However, the structural complexity of confined catalysts and the interaction with microenvironment hinders the deciphering of chemical origins behind experiments. In this work, Grand&#8208;canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are conducted for confined catalysis in CNTs at various reaction atmospheres, accelerated by machine learning potentials. The statistical outcomes of GCMC simulations corroborate a general feature that the electronic interaction (binding energy) inside CNTs is weaker than outside cases. By using Random Forest (RF) model, we ascertain that the shortening of the bond lengths of catalysts within the confined space is the dominant factor, resulting in the weakened binding energy and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center. Using the bond length variation as a simplified descriptor, our microkinetic models successfully reproduced the seemingly contradictive experiments, namely, the observed enhancement and suppression for the same reaction.

Methane's high symmetry and thermodynamic stability challenge catalytic conversion. Traditional rigid catalysts require extreme conditions, limiting efficiency. A dynamic Cu&#8208;embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu&#8208;LMC) achieves 5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;gCu&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1 methanol yield with 82&#8201;% selectivity. Mild surface oxidation forms Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga sites, enhancing active copper availability while retaining structural flexibility. These findings highlight dynamic catalyst designs as critical for overcoming traditional limitations.







Abstract
Methane (CH4), a major greenhouse gas and abundant carbon resource, presents significant challenges in catalysis due to its high symmetry and thermodynamic stability, which tend to cause over&#8208;oxidation to CO2. Traditional catalysts require high temperatures and pressures to facilitate CH4 conversion, constrained by their rigid structures which lack the flexibility needed for optimizing complex reaction steps. This study introduces a novel Cu embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu&#8208;LMC) based on gallium alloys, characterized by dynamic, self&#8208;adaptive structures that provide enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity. Our findings reveal that Cu&#8208;LMC achieves a high methane conversion to methanol yield (5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;gCu&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1) with a selectivity of 82&#8201;%. The results show that mild surface oxidation significantly boosts the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;LMC by increasing active copper sites through the formation of a Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga configuration while preserving the catalyst&#8216;s structural flexibility. In situ X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analyses, along with ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations, demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;LMC enables self&#8208;adaptive structural adjustments that lower methanol desorption energy and increase the energy barrier for by&#8208;product formation, optimizing the overall methane conversion process. The results underscore the importance of designing catalysts with dynamic and adaptable structures to overcome traditional limitations and improve efficiency in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Diffusion/Modulator Dual&#8208;Mediated Solid&#8208;Liquid/Vapor Interfacial Synthesis of Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thirteen kinds of highly crystalline and oriented COF membranes are grown directly on the inner wall of glass vessel, through a diffusion/modulator dual&#8208;mediated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial synthesis strategy. Good compatibility of solvent&#8208;monomer&#8208;substrate and the slowed down imine exchange reaction promote heterogeneous nucleation and ordered crystal growth in the interface. The resultant COF membranes exhibit satisfactory adsorption performances and LCMs removal efficiency.







Abstract
Constructing oriented crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with controllable thickness for water purification is highly desirable. Herein, we present a simple and universal protocol to prepare high&#8208;quality COF membranes on the inner wall of a glass vessel using a diffusion/modulator dual&#8208;mediated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial synthesis strategy. By meticulous control of solvent and temperature, a thin supersaturated spreading liquid layer was formed on the glass wall surface and served as a confined microreactor for incubating crystal nuclei. This induced the aniline&#8208;modulated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial exchange reaction and upward growth of a highly ordered COF membrane. The experiments and theoretical simulations revealed the underlying mechanisms of solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial nucleation, growth and crystallization. Using this strategy, we created 13 types of new, free&#8208;standing, imine&#8208;linked COF membranes with exceptional performances in crystallinity, porosity, stability, processability and adsorption capacity. As an application demonstration, a COF membrane&#8208;filled filter was coupled with high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography system for the automated removal of multitarget liquid&#8208;crystal monomers in real water samples (removal efficiency&#8805;96&#8201;%). This study enriches the synthesis toolboxes of COF membranes and broadens their application scopes.

         <title>Polyurethane Elastomers Strengthened by Pseudo[1]rotaxanes Based on Pillararenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based pseudo[1]rotaxane is introduced into a linear polyurethane to prepare a class of polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. It is found that intramolecular sliding motions of the pseudo[1]rotaxane can greatly improve the mechanical properties of polyurethane elastomers.







Abstract
As a unique property of the interlocked structures, rotaxane allows for intramolecular motions between its wheel and axle components. Introduction of rotaxanes into polymers can endow them with distinctive macroscopic features and outstanding mechanical properties. Here, we prepare a copillar[5]arene with a hydroxyl and an amino&#8208;group on each end, which can spontaneously form a pseudo[1]rotaxane through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This pseudo[1]rotaxane possesses a releasable extra alkyl chain, which is then incorporated into a linear polyurethane by reacting with a diisocyanate to prepare polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. The results of stress&#8208;strain test and dynamic mechanical analysis all indicate that sliding motions of the axle part on the pseudo[1]rotaxane in the polymer skeleton can greatly dissipate energy, which endows the elastomers with higher toughness and better fatigue resistance. Moreover, the addition of moderate amount of cuprous bromide to form cuprous&#8208;thioether coordination in the polymers can further improve the mechanical properties.

         <title>Electrolyte Decoupling Strategy for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries Free of Crosstalk Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) composed of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the Mn2+ crosstalk while facilitating Zn2+ conduction. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 full cells exhibited an extended cyclability over 900&#8197;cycles with negligible Mn2+ crosstalk, a decreased byproducts formation and H2 evolution compared with cells using an aqueous ZnCl2 electrolyte.







Abstract
The crosstalk of transition metal ions between the metal oxide cathode and Zn anode restricts the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we propose a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) consisting of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the crosstalk of Mn2+, thus extending the lifespan of MnO2&#8208;based ZIBs. Experimental measurements and theoretical modelling verify that trimethyl phosphate (TMP) not only synergistically works with NH4Cl in the N&#8208;phase anolyte to enable fast Zn2+ conduction while blocking Mn2+ diffusion toward anode, but also modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress the dendrite formation and corrosion on Zn anode. Meanwhile, the A&#8208;phase catholyte effectively accelerates the cathode reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 cell delivers 80.13&#8201;% capacity retention after 900&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This approach is applicable for other metal oxide cathode&#8208;based ZIBs, thereby opening a new avenue for developing ultrastable ZIBs.

The solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur and impressive performance are achieved in this simplified system (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C), which has the potential for further improvement.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co&#8208;solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8722;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two&#8208;steps cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent. The results demonstrate that FEC participates in both rapid nucleophilic reaction and electrochemical decomposition on cathode, which can effectively in situ construct a unique &#8220;chocolate&#8208;cookie&#8221; shaped CEI consisted of NaF&#8208;rich double layers. This CEI eliminates the shuttle effect and ensures the solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. Along with the stable F&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Na anode, the RT Na&#8722;S battery delivers an impressive performance (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C) with almost 100&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency. This significantly simplifies electrolyte design and provides valuable insights into the application of FEC in practical Na&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Propane Activation on Pt Electrodes at Room Temperature: Quantification of Adsorbate Identity and Coverage</title>

Elucidating propane activation on Pt electrocatalyst, via the use of on&#8208;line electrochemical mass spectrometer, in aqueous acidic electrolyte. Combination of mass spectrometry and reductive coulometry sheds light on adsorption and desorption of propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation is the first step in manufacturing chemical products from readily available light alkane feedstock and typically proceeds via carbon&#8208;intensive thermal processes. The ongoing emphasis on decarbonization via electrification motivates low&#8208;temperature electrochemical alternatives that could lead to sustainable chemicals production. Platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts have shown activity towards reacting alkanes; however, little is known about propane electrocatalytic activation and conditions suitable for enabling selective oxidation to valuable products. Herein, we utilize a combination of electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the potential dependence of propane activation on Pt electrocatalysts. Results show a strong dependence of adsorption on the applied potential in room&#8208;temperature aqueous acidic electrolyte, with a maximum coverage of propane&#8208;derived adsorbates at 0.30&#8197;V vs RHE. Using charge deconvolution and deuterated experiments, the mechanism of adsorption was elucidated, and C3H2* was determined as the average dehydrogenated propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species. DFT calculations further corroborate these results, showing that the formation of deeply dehydrogenated species is energetically accessible at room temperature. The combined theoretical and experimental findings yield insights for selective activation of paraffinic C&#8722;H bonds at room temperature, aqueous conditions&#8212;a critical step towards decarbonized chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom Porosity Tuning in Calixarene&#8208;Derived Porous Liquids via Supramolecular Complexation Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning in liquid phase was achieved via the constructure and structure engineering in calixarene&#8208;derived type&#8197;II porous liquids through supramolecular complexation. The well&#8208;maintained permanent porosity was confirmed via pressure swing gas adsorption and altered CO2 physisorption behavior. Slight difference between 4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197; in porosity of the calixarene host caused significant dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 and Xe molecules.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level porosity engineering, which is appealing in gas separations, has been demonstrated in solid carbon, polymer, and framework materials but rarely achieved in the liquid phase. In this work, a gas molecular sieving effect in the liquid phase at sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom scale is created via sophisticated porosity tuning in calixarene&#8208;derived porous liquids (PLs). Type&#8197;II PLs are constructed via supramolecular complexation between the sodium salts of calixarene derivatives and crown ether solvents. The chemical structure variation and assembly behavior of the porous host upon PL construction are monitored by spectroscopy&#8208;, X&#8208;ray&#8208;, and neutron&#8208;scattering techniques. The presence of permanent porosity in calixarene&#8208;derived PLs is verified by pressure swing gas uptake, altered CO2 physisorption behavior, and molecular simulations. Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning within the PL phase is achieved by introducing bulky substituted groups on the benzene ring of the calixarene host, which then greatly affects the dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 molecules and the Xe uptake performance. The approach being demonstrated in this work represents a promising pathway to tune and leverage the porosity effect for enhanced gas uptake capacity and selectivity in liquid sorbents.

An enzymatic reaction network (ERN) for polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system: polymerization, coacervation, dissolution and selective cargo uptake.







Abstract
A living cell has a highly complex microenvironment whereas numerous enzyme&#8208;driven processes are active at once. These procedures are incredibly accurate and efficient, although comparable control has not yet been established in vitro. Here, we design an enzymatic reaction network (ERN) that combines antagonistic and orthogonal enzymatic networks to produce adjustable dynamics of ATP&#8208;fueled transient coacervation. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mediated Biocatalytic Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (BioATRP), we synthesized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), which subsequently formed coacervates with ATP. We rationally explored enzymatic control over coacervation and dissolution, using orthogonal and antagonistic enzyme pairs viz., alkaline phosphatase, Creatine phosphokinase, hexokinase, esterase, and urease. ATP&#8208;fuelled coacervates also demonstrate the enzymatic catalysis to prove its potential to be exploited as a cellular microreactor. Additionally, we developed ERN&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system, polymerization, coacervation, and dissolution. Notably, the coacervation process itself determines functional properties, as seen in selective cargo uptake. The strategy offers cutting&#8208;edge biomimetic applications, and insights into cellular compartmentalization by bridging the gap between synthetic and biological systems. The development of temporally programmed coacervation is promising for the spatial arrangement of multienzyme cascades, and offers novel ideas on the architecture of artificial cells.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow in Flexible Polymeric Materials through the Introduction of Electron Donor/Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers were fabricated through the introduction of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. The polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow persisting for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions. The polymers are flexible and transparent, which are useful properties for flexible display applications. Moreover, the polymers were spun into fibers with the HLA property remaining, which holds promise for application in wearable smart devices.







Abstract
The development of organic afterglow materials has garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in smart devices, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. However, polymeric afterglow materials often suffer from short emission lifetimes, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, posing a significant challenge for achieving hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers. This study presents the successful fabrication of transparent HLA polymers by introducing electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Employing aromatic polyesters as the polymer electron acceptor and charge reservoirs, the resulting HLA polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow that persisted for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions, representing the longest duration achieved for polymeric afterglow materials to date. Intriguingly, these HLA polymers could be activated solely by sunlight, maintaining a green afterglow for over 6&#8197;hours at room temperature in air, which outperformed all previously reported afterglow polymers. The doped polymers exhibited superior flexibility and transparency, making them ideal candidates for flexible display applications. Furthermore, successfully spinning these doped polymers into fibers while retaining their HLA properties opens up exciting possibilities for their use in wearable smart devices.

Moreover, the polymers were spun into fibers with the HLA property remaining, which holds promise for application in wearable smart devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of organic afterglow materials has garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in smart devices, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. However, polymeric afterglow materials often suffer from short emission lifetimes, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, posing a significant challenge for achieving hour-long afterglow (HLA) polymers. This study presents the successful fabrication of transparent HLA polymers by introducing electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Employing aromatic polyesters as the polymer electron acceptor and charge reservoirs, the resulting HLA polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow that persisted for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions, representing the longest duration achieved for polymeric afterglow materials to date. Intriguingly, these HLA polymers could be activated solely by sunlight, maintaining a green afterglow for over 6&#8197;hours at room temperature in air, which outperformed all previously reported afterglow polymers. The doped polymers exhibited superior flexibility and transparency, making them ideal candidates for flexible display applications. Furthermore, successfully spinning these doped polymers into fibers while retaining their HLA properties opens up exciting possibilities for their use in wearable smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Passivation of Perovskite Films via Gradual Additive Release for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this, we propose a dynamic passivation strategy that employs a pre&#8208;passivator, formamidinesulfinic acid (FSA), to synchronize the release of additives with the generation of defect sites, thereby enabling in situ and real&#8208;time defect passivation. A champion perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, accompanied with an exceptional stability.







Abstract
Modifying perovskites with functional additives has proven effective in refining the crystallization process and passivating the defects of perovskite films, thereby ensuring high photovoltaic efficiencies. However, conventional methods that involve pre&#8208;mixing additives into the precursor solution often face challenges due to discrepancies in the spatial distribution of slow&#8208;diffused additives relative to dynamically formed defect sites, resulting in limited passivation effectiveness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a dynamic passivation strategy that utilizes a pre&#8208;passivator to gradually release active additives during the thermal crystallization process of perovskite films. By leveraging the principle of energy minimization, these timely&#8208;released additives can interact precisely and selectively with the high&#8208;energy defect sites generated during crystallization, thus facilitating efficient additive utilization and in situ real&#8208;time defect passivation. Through analysis of crystallization kinetics and carrier dynamic, it is demonstrated that this dynamic passivation approach significantly improves film quality and prolongs carrier lifetime, outperforming traditional pre&#8208;mixing tactics. Consequently, the final perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. This work provides strong support of tailored additive strategies aimed at further enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and their subsequent commercial applications.

         <title>Interfacial Water Orientation in Neutral Oxygen Catalysis for Reversible Ampere&#8208;Scale Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

A significant breakthrough in neutral oxygen catalysis was achieved by altering the orientation of water molecules from conventional O&#8208;down to unexpected H&#8208;down in the hydrogen bond network.







Abstract
The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H&#8208;down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record&#8208;breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10&#8197;mA = 0.85/1.65&#8201;V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500&#8197;h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere&#8208;scale zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0&#8201;A and 1.0&#8201;Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF&#8208;active silver cluster exhibiting near&#8208;unity PLQY has been achieved through lattice modulation involving cation exchange followed by desolvation. The removal of the guest solvent via thermal activation in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformation fashion effectively controls the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting and surpasses both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay of the clusters, thereby boosting the PLQY from 12% to near&#8208;unity.







Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208; active silver cluster, achieving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12&#8201;% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lowers the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549&#8197;cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY is extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.

         <title>Precise Separation of Complex Ultrafine Molecules through Solvating Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic and reversible structural deformations in crystallographically oriented two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes upon solvent exposure are disclosed. We leverage this to design molecular separation membranes and correlate sieving pore sizes with the number of COF layers. The membrane delivers exceptional stability, molecular selectivity, and practicality for pharmaceutical purification.







Abstract
Isoporous nanomaterials, with their proven potential for accurate molecular sieving, are of substantial interest in propelling sustainable membrane techniques. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are prominent due to their customizable isopores and chemistry. Still, the discrepancy in experimental and theoretical structures poses a challenge to developing COF membranes for molecular separations. Here, we report high&#8208;selectivity sieving of complex ultrafine molecules through solvating pore&#8208;to&#8208;pore&#8208;aligned two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes. Our structurally oriented membrane shows reversible interlayer expansion with intralayer shift in response to solvent exposure. This dynamic deformation induced by solvents leads to a reduction in the aperture of the membrane's sieving pores, which correlates with the number of COF layers. The resultant membranes yield largely improved molecular selectivity to discriminate binary and trinary complex mixtures, exceeding the conventional COF membranes. The membrane's robustness against solvents and physical aging permits extremely stable microporosity and reliable operation for over 3000&#8197;h. This exceptional performance positions our membrane as an alternative to enriching and purifying value&#8208;added chemicals, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Blue hyper&#8208;OLED devices using the Ir(III) emitter m&#8208;ct16 as the dopant sensitizer at 30&#8197;wt&#8201;% and &#957;&#8208;DABNA as the terminal emitter at 1 (2)&#8197;wt&#8201;% afforded blue emission with a narrowband peak maximum at 471 (472)&#8197;nm, CIEy of 0.157 (0.149), EQE1000 of 32.1 (28.4)&#8201;%, and J90 of 15.0 (31.0)&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, setting a new record of Figure of merit (FOM) and showing minimal quenching at high current density.







Abstract
Ir(III) complexes are particularly noted for their excellent photophysical properties in giving blue OLED phosphors. In this study, two distinctive carbene pro&#8208;chelates LAH2+ and LBH2+ (or LCH2+) were employed in preparation of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, to which LAH2+ bears a cyano substituted benzoimidazolium along with N&#8208;mesityl appendage, while LBH2+ (or LCH2+) carries the symmetrical benzoimidazolium entity. Notably, the reversible equilibration at high temperature was observed for m, f&#8208;ct14 and m, f&#8208;ct15 with a single LA chelate. In contrast, only the mer&#8208;substituted m&#8208;ct16 was obtained upon employing two LA chelates. All Ir(III) complexes exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#934;PL

Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED based on m&#8208;ct16 and v&#8208;DABNA exhibited EQE1000 of 32.1&#8201;% (EQE recorded at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2) and J90 of 15.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (current density at 90&#8201;% of max. EQE). Its suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE of 32.1&#8201;% and 27.7&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2 and 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2) demonstrated a milestone in fabrication of blue OLED devices.

         <title>A Hydrolytically Stable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous Desulfurization and Dehydration of Wet Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrolytically stable MOF has been reported for capturing SO2 from wet flue gas. Strikingly, the SO2 capture efficiency of the material is barely influenced by humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that its delicate pore structure featuring diverse pore dimensions and chemistry enables the segregation of trace SO2 and a large amount of water into different domains, paving the way for simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great prospects as adsorbents for industrial gas purification, but often suffer from issues of water stability and competitive water adsorption. Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue&#8208;gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water&#8208;derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non&#8208;competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost&#8208;effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.

         <title>Flexible Fiber Sensors for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Redox Signaling Molecules in Exercise&#8208;Mimicking Engineered Skeletal Muscle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of dual flexible electrochemical sensors and achieved simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to exercise&#8208;mimicking stretch. The results proved that proper warm&#8208;up training could help improve exercise adaptation in skeletal muscle.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in skeletal muscle provides crucial insights into the cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationships between physical activity and health benefits. However, the dynamic production of exercise&#8208;induced RONS remains poorly explored, due to the lack of sensing tools that can conform to soft skeletal muscle while monitor RONS release during exercise. Here we introduce dual flexible sensors via twisting carbon nanotubes into helical bundles of fibers and subsequent assembling electrochemical sensing components. These flexible sensors exhibit low bending stiffness, excellent H2O2 and NO sensing abilities, outstanding biocompatibility and compliance with engineered skeletal muscle tissue. This allows real&#8208;time and simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to different exercise&#8208;mimicking stretches, which reveals that warm&#8208;up activities before high&#8208;intensity exercise may enhance adaptive responses by down&#8208;regulating H2O2 and up&#8208;regulating NO production. The proposed sensing strategy demonstrates great versatility in monitoring multiple biomarkers of soft tissue and organs.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Sulfated Zirconium Oxide is Mediated by a Sulfur&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfated Zirconium Oxide contains pyrosulfates that act as a reservoir of transiently adsorbed SO3 and sulfate. The open form of the pyrosulfate is very reactive towards C&#8722;H bonds in Ph3CH to form Ph3C+ or C&#8722;H bonds in highdensity polyethylene or isotactic polypropylene polymers to form cleavage products under hydrogenolysis conditions.







Abstract
Sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO) catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of isotactic polypropylene (iPP, Mw=13.3&#8197;kDa, &#272;=2.4, &lt;mmmm&gt;=94&#8201;%) or high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE, Mn=2.5&#8197;kDa, &#272;=3.6) to branched alkane products. We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites SZO, which open under mild conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO3 and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO3 is a very strong Lewis acid that binds 15N&#8208;pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (&#916;Eads&gt;&#8722;39&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), reacts with Ph3CH to form Ph3C+, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene&#8208;d4. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 barrier to form the adsorbed SO3 and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO3 between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how SZO, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfated zirconium oxide (&lt;b&gt;SZO&lt;/b&gt;) catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of isotactic polypropylene (iPP, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;=13.3&#8197;kDa, &lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt;=2.4, &amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;mmmm&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;=94&#8201;%) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=2.5&#8197;kDa, &lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt;=3.6) to branched alkane products. We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites &lt;b&gt;SZO&lt;/b&gt;, which open under mild conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a very strong Lewis acid that binds &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;&#8722;39&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), reacts with Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH to form Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; barrier to form the adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;-scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how &lt;b&gt;SZO&lt;/b&gt;, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Modular Peptide Nanoparticles for Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an orchestrated nanoparticle system utilizing modular peptide assemblies for optimizing both assembly properties and therapeutic functionalities. The resulting nanoparticles, which integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8722;L1 antagonist, address the limitations of current IDO1 inhibitors through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
Indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors are promising for treating tumors but have limited efficacy due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we develop an orchestrated nanoparticle system using modular peptide assemblies, where the co&#8208;assembled sequences are designed for the specific binding to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, guiding the assembly process and enabling the customization of nanoparticle properties. We exploit the modularity of this platform to integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8722;L1 antagonist for optimizing therapeutic outcomes through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy. The resulting nanoparticles induce immunogenic ferroptosis, enhance the intratumoral function of T lymphocytes, suppress regulatory T cells, and effectively modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby facilitating regression of tumor growth. This work provides a modular peptide&#8208;based nanoparticle engineering strategy and holds significant potential for advancing cancer treatment.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly of PROTACs by Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Precision Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

Nano&#8208;click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) are an innovative strategy for tumor protein degradation, using divided precursors encapsulated in cyclic RGDfC peptide&#8208;modified liposomes (cRGD&#8208;LPs). This system enables in situ self&#8208;assembly to form complete PROTACs within tumors, preventing premature bioorthogonal reactions and enhancing targeting to integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;expressing tumors for precise and efficient degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold immense promise for targeted protein degradation; however, challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, poor drug&#8208;likeness properties, and the &#8220;hook effect&#8221; remain. This study introduces Nano&#8208;Click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) for precise tumor protein degradation in vivo. Traditional PROTACs with high molecular weight were first divided into two smaller druglike precursors capable of self&#8208;assembling to form functional PROTACs through a bioorthogonal reaction. Then, optimal CLIPTACs precursors (W4 and Z2) were encapsulated individually into cyclic RGDfC&#8208;peptide&#8208;modified liposomes to prepare Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs, enabling tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and subsequent in situ self&#8208;assembly to form PROTACs WZ42 within tumor cells. The degradation abilities of Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs in vitro and in vivo were further verified using a key oncology target, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), validating the safety, efficacy and &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; of this strategy. Overall, Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs represent a critical step towards the clinical translation of PROTACs technology for precise targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore) captures SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by specific receptor proteins ACE2 and changes the charge on the outer surface of the nanopore to enable the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This method eliminates the need for sample pre&#8208;treatment, enables rapid target detection, and allows for the detection of different targets by changing the cell membrane.







Abstract
Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100&#8201;%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.

         <title>Interface Engineering of MOF Nanosheets for Accelerated Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni) nanosheets with the merits of robust structures and efficient catalytic metal sites has been presented for separator modification in Li&#8208;S batteries. The ultrathin modification layer with the uniform pore channels and efficient catalytic species can achieve fast Li+ transportation, effective polysulfides interception, and rapid catalytic conversion of polysulfides.







Abstract
Modifying the separator is considered as an effective strategy for achieving high performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, most modification layers are excessively thick, with catalytic active sites primarily located within the material&#8242;s interior. This configuration severely impacts Li+ transport and the efficient catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a multifunctional separator that integrates ultrathin design, catalytic activity, and ion sieving capabilities. Herein, we successfully linked TCPP(Ni) as a secondary ligand with Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets to create an ultra&#8208;thin separator modification layer (Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)) with efficient ion sieving and catalytic properties. The resultant multifunctional separators provide robust ion sieving capabilities that promote rapid Li+ transport and intercept polysulfides shuttling. Therefore, The Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)@PP cell maintains 70.0&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 600&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 3&#8197;C, while achieving an impressive areal capacity of 4.55&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;2 even with high sulfur content of 80&#8197;wt% at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights for rational design of MOF interface engineering in high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universally applicable supramolecular strategy to transition room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from solid states to aqueous phases is reported. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, a series of aqueous RTP materials are constructed through the noncovalent dispersion of diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain.







Abstract
Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8211;790&#8197;nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450&#8197;nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8211;30.7&#8201;%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.

         <title>Selective Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalysed by Simple Alkali&#8208;Metal Bases in DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple alkali&#8208;metal bases catalyse efficient and selective hydrogen isotope exchange in the presence of the deuterium source dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;d6. Heterocycles, amides, fluoroarenes and other aromatic motifs can be selectively deuterated at room temperature under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies show the crucial role of the metalated solvent, enabling the design of a new set of conditions for less reactive substrates.







Abstract
Isotope Exchange processes are becoming the preferred way to prepare isotopically labelled molecules, avoiding the redesign of multistep synthetic protocols. In the case of deuterium incorporation, the most used strategy has employed transition metals, that offer high reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Despite their success, the trade&#8208;off is that these metals are precious, so expensive, and often exhibit high toxicity. Therefore, alternative transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols would be a welcome addition to this field. In this report we show how the simple bases NaHMDS (HMDS=hexamethyldisilazide) and NaCH2SiMe3 can efficiently and selectively promote deuteration of a wide range of C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in DMSO&#8208;d6, providing an easy and direct access to deuterated compounds. Heterocycles, fluoroarenes, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, amides and other aromatic molecules could be deuterated under mild conditions using catalytic amounts of base. Mechanistic studies along with the isolation and characterisation of reaction intermediates have flagged up the importance of the metalated substrate and metalated solvent in solution, establishing an equilibrium between these compounds is crucial for the success of this approach. An alkali&#8208;metal effect was observed, with heavier alkali&#8208;metal amides being more reactive at room temperature, but their lower stability at higher temperatures made sodium bases the optimal reagents for Hydrogen Isotope Exchange.

         <title>Photochromic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Based on Host&#8208;Guest Strategy and Different Viologen Derivatives for Organic Amines Sensing and Information Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the design of three photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) encapsulating viologen derivatives by host&#8208;guest strategy. NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit notable reversible photochromic change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation owing to the production of intermolecular viologen radicals. Based on the excellent photochromic properties of viologens, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 enable intuitive detection of volatile amine and anticounterfeiting applications.







Abstract
The encapsulation of viologen derivatives in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct host&#8208;guest materials has been widely discussed owing to their distinctive spatial arrangement and physical/chemical properties. Herein, three new photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) have been successfully synthesized by 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) ligand as well as three different viologen derivatives based on host&#8208;guest strategy. Remarkably, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit a notable reversible photochromism change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation. The distance between the electron&#8208;deficient N atom in the viologens and the electron&#8208;rich carboxylate oxygens satisfies the electron transfer (ET) pathway, and thus ET occurs upon irradiation, producing intermolecular viologen radicals. NWM&#8208;1 is able to produce colored responses to different volatile amines by ET and can be recognizable to the naked eye. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis and comparative experiments have demonstrated that the host&#8208;guest strategy significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of viologens, thereby achieving superior amine sensing performance. NWM&#8208;2 and 3 have been realized in various applications, such as security code, fingerprint, and QR codes for anticounterfeiting. This work provides new host&#8208;guest strategy for designing highly sensitive photochromic materials and color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials, advancing the development of assembled photochromic materials closer to commercialization.

         <title>Identifying N Coordination Types of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Spin&#8208;Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental and theoretical evidences have been provided that modulating the type of nitrogen coordination in Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can change the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron configuration of Co atom and selectively regulate the O2 activation capacity, resulting in the production of different reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn affects the subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviour. Based on the correlation between nitrogen coordination type and luminol/dissolved oxygen cathodic ECL behaviour, we propose a strategy based on luminol cathode ECL to rapidly identify the nitrogen coordination type of SACs.







Abstract
The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal&#8208;N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of N&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal&#8208;N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN4 SACs, were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN4(pyridinic N), for which the spin density displays dz2 orbital characteristics, CoN4(pyrrolic N) exhibits dxz orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8722;O bond in O2&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8722;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN4 SACs.

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Opening Control Strategy via Nitrate&#8211;Chloride Anion Exchange for Enhanced Hydrogen Isotope Separation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Gate&#8208;opening control via anion exchange in JCM&#8208;1 enables enhanced hydrogen isotope separation through precise tuning of pore aperture and diffusion barriers. The dynamic interplay between structural flexibility and adsorption energetics maximizes D2/H2 selectivity, establishing a robust platform for cryogenic gas separation applications.







Abstract
Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes, especially deuterium (D2), is pivotal for advancing industries such as nuclear fusion, semiconductor processing, and metabolic imaging. Current technologies, including cryogenic distillation and Girdler sulfide processes, suffer from significant limitations in selectivity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we introduce a novel approach utilizing an imidazolium&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), JCM&#8208;1, designed to enhance D2/H2 separation through temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;opening controlled by ion exchange. By substituting NO3&#8722; ions in JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) with Cl&#8722; ions to form JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;), we precisely modulate the gate&#8208;opening threshold, achieving a significant enhancement in isotope selectivity. JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) exhibited a D2/H2 selectivity (SD2/H2) of 14.4 at 30&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, while JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50&#8197;K and 1&#8197;mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate&#8208;opening temperature resulting from the Cl&#8722; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D2. Our findings reveal that JCM&#8208;1 frameworks, with their finely tunable gate&#8208;opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion&#8208;exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the chemical activity of isolated metal atoms confined in graphene on Ni(111), using carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. At room temperature, CO stably adsorbs on Co but not on Ni. Electronic descriptors clarify this behavior, offering valuable insights for designing graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.

         <title>A Catch&#8208;Release Strategy for the Genomics&#8208;Driven Discovery of Antiproliferative Furan&#8208;Functionalized Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A streamlined strategy for the discovery and isolation of pharmacologically relevant furan&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides is presented. Genome mining prioritizes microbes harboring specialized 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) synthases, and a reversible Fua Diels&#8211;Alder reaction enables the rapid and selective discovery and resin&#8208;based purification of Fua&#8208;bearing compounds. Two new classes of antiproliferative Fua&#8208;harboring peptides were identified in this way.







Abstract
Furan&#8208;functionalized peptides are of significant pharmacological interest due to their pronounced bioactivities and unique potential for orthogonal bioconjugation and derivatization. However, naturally occurring peptides with furyl side chains are exceedingly rare. This study presents a streamlined method to predict and assess the microbial production of peptides incorporating 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) moieties. The approach integrates genome mining and the reversible, chemoselective tagging of furyl residues, utilizing their unique Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity, for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;guided identification of candidate compounds. By employing the rhizonin Fua synthase as a bioinformatic handle and through heterologous reconstitution of Fua biosynthesis, we identified previously unknown Fua biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacterial phyla, including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and &#947;&#8208;proteobacteria, suggesting that Fua&#8208;containing peptides are remarkably widely distributed. Metabolic profiling by reversible tagging facilitated the detection of Fua&#8208;containing metabolites in their native producers. The successful adaptation of this method for solid support enabled the direct enrichment of furyl&#8208;substituted peptides from complex mixtures. This multi&#8208;pronged approach enabled the discovery and characterization of two novel families of Fua cyclopeptides (rubriamides and typhamides) with potent antiproliferative effects against human tumor cells and nematodes. The innovative catch&#8208;and&#8208;release strategy, in conjunction with genome mining, represents a valuable tool for the discovery of new furan&#8208;substituted natural products.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Confined Disordered Hydrogen Bonds Enable Efficient Lithium Transport in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State PEO&#8208;Based Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ASSEs) optimization approach with surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bonds is developed through the construction of rich donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. The crystallization inhibition of PEO, anchoring of TFSI&#8722;, and weak coordination of Li+ are realized while maintaining the stability of the Li+&#8208;conducting system, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are essential to advance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with high safety/energy density due to their inherent flexibility and scalability. However, the inefficient Li+ transport in PEO often leads to poor rate performance and diminished stability of the ASSLBs. The regulation of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds is regarded as one of the most effective approaches to enable efficient Li+ transport, while the practical performances are hindered by the electrochemical instability of free H&#8208;bond donors and the constrained mobility of highly ordered H&#8208;bonding structures. To overcome these challenges, we develop a surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bond system with stable donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to construct a loosened chain segments/ions arrangement in the bulk phase of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes, realizing the crystallization inhibition of PEO, weak coordination of Li+ and entrapment of anions, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport and stable Li+ deposition. The rationally designed LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLB demonstrates a long cycle&#8208;life of over 400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C and 65&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity retention rate of 87.5&#8201;%, surpassing most of the currently reported polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs. This work highlights the importance of confined disordered H&#8208;bonds on Li+ transport in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system, paving the way for the future design of polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs.

         <title>Directing Zn Growth with Biased Adsorption of Straight&#8208;chain Molecules for Superior Zn Anode Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) with double terminated polar groups was designed as an additive for the aqueous electrolyte. The hydroxyl groups firmly anchor the Scms to the Zn anode surface through horizontal adsorption, which enables high surface coverage. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that selective adsorption of Scms on Zn surface induces the deposition behavior of Zn and protects the Zn anode. The electrochemical performance of cells with Scms is significantly improved, especially at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), which have attracted attentions in the field of energy storage, is affected by dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a biased adsorption strategy mediated by straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) for stabilizing Zn anode. The dual polar termini of Scms guaranties securely anchor themselves in a parallel orientation upon the Zn anode surface. This provides a comprehensive coverage, effectively sequestering water molecules from the Zn anode and precipitating the formation of a water&#8208;depleted electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the Scms selectively adsorb along the crystallographic planes, guiding the deposition of Zn2+. Consequently, the incorporation of these Scms successfully mitigates anode corrosion, HER, and dendrites. The Zn||Zn, Zn||Cu and Zn||V6O13 cells with Scms display significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially at elevated temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the potential of cost&#8208;effective, straight&#8208;chain electrolyte additives for enhancing Zn anode stability.

         <title>t2 Occupancy as an Effective and Predictive Descriptor for the Design of High&#8208;Performance Spinel Oxide Peroxidase&#8208;like Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
t2 occupancy was first reported as an effective and predictive descriptor for spinel oxide nanozymes. Spinel oxides with a medium t2 occupancy of about 4.4 occupied the volcanic apex, possessing the highest peroxidase&#8208;like activity. By combining t2 occupancy with a dual descriptors strategy (O&#946; as a secondary descriptor) that drove a 3D volcanic curve and a dual&#8208;site optimizing strategy beyond the limits of volcanic curve, a rational design strategy was proposed, obtaining the high&#8208;performance CuCo2O4 nanozyme.







Abstract
Nanozymes are next generation of enzyme mimics. Due to the lack of activity descriptors, most nanozymes were discovered through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies or by accident. While eg occupancy in an octahedral crystal field was proven as an effective descriptor, the t2 in a tetrahedral crystal field has rarely been explored. Here, we first identified t2 occupancy as an effective and predictive descriptor. Then, we predicted and demonstrated that spinel oxide nanozymes (AB2O4) with a t2 occupancy of around 4.4 at A site had the highest activity. Furthermore, we introduced O&#946; content as a secondary descriptor. The dual descriptor strategy resulted in a three&#8208;dimensional volcanic curve, converging at a vertex. To surpass the limitations of volcanic curves, a dual site optimizing strategy was proposed, guiding the optimization of both A and B sites as Cu and Co, respectively. The designed CuCo2O4 exhibited the highest activity, achieving around 100&#8208; and 2&#8208;fold enhancement compared to initial material and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spinel oxide nanozyme LiCo2O4, respectively. Density functional theory calculations provided a theoretical basis for the catalytic process. This work provides a new strategy for the rational design of nanozymes, and t2 occupancy may also be applicable to the design of other catalysts.

         <title>Constrained Heterogeneous CoFe2O4/ZnO/PMS Fenton&#8208;Like System for Industrial Wastewater Remediation with Recyclability and Zero Metal Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

The reaction region in constrained completely heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction was clarified to within slipping plane rather traditional particle interface, which exhibited outstanding salt resistance, recyclability, and extremely low metal ion loss.







Abstract
Although heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like processes have attracted widespread attention in wastewater treatment, the mass leached active ions lead to secondary pollution and confuse the demarcation of reaction region. By constructing a constrained completely heterogeneous system and highlighting its reaction region concentrated within the slipping plane of particles, this work achieves efficient organic pollutants degradation without leaching of any free active metal components. Based on the Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation and electric double layer model, the specific existing of the constrained region is confirmed, and this neglected reaction region between solid interface and slipping plane in traditional heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction is clarified firstly. Due to the unique constrained property, this system demonstrates exceptional potentials application to natural water and actual industrial wastewater for its broad resistance to environmental interference. Furthermore, the alkalization aging process enables this system achieve catalyst recycle and zero metal ions emission with maintaining outstanding pollutants removing performance even in high&#8208;salt wastewater, exhibiting the superiority of the constrained completely heterogeneous system. This work demonstrated the important reaction region within slipping plane and provided a clearer boundary in heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like system.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction through Enhanced Mass Transfer in Cu&#8208;Bipyridine 2D Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating Cu&#8208;bipyridine 2D covalent organic framework films with significantly exposed catalytic sites and boosting electrocatalytic nitrate reduction through Cu&#8722;N synergistic deoxidation and hydrogenation mechanism. Cu sites act as key centers for adsorption and activation, while bipyridine sites facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, providing H* and accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) is a promising method for pollutant removal and ammonia synthesis and involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons. As such, the rational design of catalytic interfaces with enhanced mass transfer is crucial for achieving high ammonia yield rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). In this work, we incorporated a Cu&#8208;bipyridine catalytic interface and fabricated crystalline 2D covalent organic framework films with significantly exposed catalytic sites, leading to improved FE and ammonia yield (FE=92.7&#8201;%, NH3 yield rate=14.9&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M nitrate) compared to bulk catalysts and outperforming most reported NO3RR electrocatalysts. The film&#8208;like morphology enhances mass transfer across the Cu&#8208;bipyridine interface, resulting in superior catalytic performance. We confirmed the reaction pathway and mechanism through in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. The Cu sites act as primary centers for adsorption and activation, while the bipyridine sites facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, supplying sufficient H* and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics. This study provides a viable strategy to enhance mass transfer at the catalytic interface through rational morphology control, boosting the intrinsic activity of catalysts in the NO3RR process.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active&#8208;site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.







Abstract
Here we report a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine&#8208;based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders.

     alt="Nitrogen-Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of nitrogen-rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine-based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active-site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report a series of nitrogen-rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine-based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out-of-plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine-based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical PAs3S3 with Perfectly Aligned Polar Molecular Cage via a Bipolar&#8208;Axis&#8208;Symmetry Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy to enhance the arrangement of polar molecular cages for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. By substituting C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar [PAs3S3] cages in the &#946;&#8208;BBO lattice, we synthesized PAs3S3 (PAS), which maintains a consistent polar arrangement crucial for optimal NLO performance. PAS exhibits an impressive second harmonic generation (SHG) approximately eight times that of AgGaS2, with a substantial band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV and robust stability against air and moisture, positioning it as a promising candidate for IR NLO applications.







Abstract
Strong polar molecular cages have recently emerged as novel functional building units for high&#8208;performance infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. However, these highly polar molecular cages often arrange themselves in a way that cancels out their polarity, leading to a more energetically stable state. As a result, most cage crystal formations tend to crystallize in centrosymmetric space groups, which conflicts with the primary requirement for NLO crystals. Herein, we address the challenge of polar molecular cage arrangement through bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy, utilizing classical NLO parent compounds. By substituting the C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar C3v symmetric [PAs3S3] cages within the &#946;&#8208;BBO polar aixs lattice, we successfully synthesized a new compound, PAs3S3 (PAS), which exhibits a consistent arrangement of polar molecular cages &#8212; crucial for maximizing NLO performance. Additionally, due to the non&#8208;covalent interactions among [PAs3S3] polar molecular cages, PAS demonstrates an unexpectedly strong second harmonic generation (SHG) about 8 times that of AgGaS2, along with a significant band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV. Furthermore, PAS exhibits remarkable stability against air and moisture. These findings validate our design strategy and position PAS as a promising candidate for applications in IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbon Fixation Using Photosynthetic Organelles in Artificial Photosynthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthetic organelles were constructed to efficiently produce ATP in the presence of phycocyanin. They were encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles together with a carbon fixation pathway to build artificial photosynthetic cells to produce acetyl&#8208;CoA upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Building an artificial photosynthetic cell from scratch helps to understand the working mechanisms of chloroplasts. It is a challenge to achieve carbon fixation triggered by photosynthetic organelles in an artificial cell. ATP synthase and photosystem II (PSII) are purified and reconstituted onto the phospholipid membrane to fabricate photosynthetic organelles. With the integration of phycocyanin, the ATP production yield increases by 2.51&#8208;fold due to the enhanced light harvesting capability. The carbon fixation pathway is established by converting &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate with cascade enzyme reactions including the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), aconitase (ACO), and ATP citrate lyase (ACL). The photosynthetic organelles, phycocyanin, and carbon fixation pathway are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles to obtain artificial photosynthetic cells, which convert &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate inside artificial cells upon light irradiation. The acetyl&#8208;CoA is the most important intermediate product in the cellular metabolic networks for the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our results provide a way for efficient light energy conversion to produce ATP and fix CO2, and pave the path to build autonomous artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks.

         <title>Amplified Cascade Catalysis for RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amplified cascade catalysis consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) deoxygenation and Fenton reaction is reported and applied to reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The two catalysts used in this amplified cascade catalysis can interact with each other, enabling regeneration of ferrocene catalyst and thus enhancing hydroxyl radical production and polymerization rate. The concept of amplified cascade catalysis and the way how a biocatalyst recycles a chemical catalyst to enhance catalysis efficiency may inspire development of sustainable and ecofriendly catalytic methodologies for organic and material synthesis.







Abstract
We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.

         <title>Chiroptical Response of Carbon Nanocages Enhanced by Achiral Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometrical reinforcement of chiral carbon cages by supramolecular technique led to enhancement of sensitivity against circularly polarized red light with an improved dissymmetry factor where the achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN are engaged in inhibition of undesired arrangement of transition dipole moments.







Abstract
Opening up [60]fullerene makes itself inherently chiral without loss of congenital &#960;&#8208;conjugation. An immoderately large aperture on [60]fullerene, however, renders the molecule less rigid and therefore it would reduce dissymmetry factors. Herein, we examined supramolecular technique in geometrical reinforcement of chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes by encasing achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN. At a lowest&#8208;energy transition, we confirmed a guest&#8208;dependency on chiroptical responses with increasing a dissymmetry factor by nearly twice to three times. It should be noted that the guests play a negligible role in electronic structures of the carbon cages. Instead, they are engaged in preclusion of an orifice shrinking not to reduce chiroptical response.

         <title>Dynamically Stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ Pair Sites Based on In Situ&#8208;Exsolved Cu Nanoclusters on CaCO3 for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically investigated factors influencing Cu&#8722;O reducibility, focusing on electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy. The Cu/CaCO3 interface was found to generate low&#8208;reducibility Cu0Cu0.13+ sites, achieving an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#8201;%. An in situ reconstruction strategy during CO2RR enabled dynamically stable, highly dispersed Cu nanoclusters on CaCO3 nanospheres.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based catalysts are the choice for producing multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) during CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), where the Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites are proposed to be synergistic hotspots for C&#8722;C coupling. Maintaining their dynamic stability requires precise control over electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy, posing significant challenges. Here, we present an in situ reconstruction strategy to create dynamically stable Cu0Cu0.18+OCa motifs at the interface of exsolved Cu nanoclusters and CaCO3 nanospheres (Cu/CaCO3). In situ XAFS analysis confirmed the low&#8208;valency state of Cu&#948;+ during CO2RR. DFT calculations demonstrated that the nanocluster size arises from the balance between metal&#8208;support interactions and Cu&#8722;Cu cohesive energy, while the dynamic stability of rich interfacial Cu&#948;+ sites is attributed to their low electron affinity and high CO32&#8722; vacancy formation energy, which collectively contribute to reduced reducibility. The transformed Cu/CaCO3 exhibits an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#8201;% at a partial current density of 393&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, facilitated by adsorption of *CO with varying electronegativity at heterogeneous copper sites that lowers the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Our findings establish insoluble carbonate as an effective anion pairing for Cu0Cu&#948;+ sites, highlighting the effectiveness of the in situ reconstitution strategy in producing a high density of dynamically stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites.

         <title>Precise Manipulation on the Structural Defects of Poly (Triazine Imide) Single Crystals for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compositionally complementary comonomers are employed to synthesize poly (triazine imide) single crystal and to continuously manipulate the nature of structural defect, aiming at obtaining the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;system with atomic precision. By inhibiting the C&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced exciton radiative loss and N&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced nonradiative loss, a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers, represented by polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), have risen to prominence as new&#8208;generation photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). Despite considerable efforts, achieving highly crystalline PCNs with minimal structural defects remains a great challenge, and it is also difficult to examine the exact impact of complex defect states on OWS process, which largely limits their quantum efficiency. Herein, we devise a &#8216;in&#8208;situ salt flux&#8217; assisted copolymerization protocol by using nitrogen&#8208;rich and nitrogen&#8208;deficient monomers to precisely manipulate the structural defects of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) single crystals. Stoichiometric control between two comonomers enables continuous tunning of carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;vacancies within PTI, allowing the construction of a series of PTI crystals with different defect states. Theoretical and experimental results unveil the carbon vacancies are related with the radiative decay of excitons, while the nonradiative decay is mainly derived from the nitrogen vacancies. Owing to the effective suppression of both radiative and nonradiative losses, the as&#8208;synthesized PTI achieves a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% by one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation OWS. This work highlights the significance of rational control of the structural defects and describes clear structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships in PTI photocatalyst, offering guidance for the development of polymer photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts with Nonplanar and Triple Pyrrole&#8208;N Coordination for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper designs a series of nonplanar and precise triple&#8208;coordinated SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis and proposes a new descriptor (&#916;&#1013;d&#8208;p). Moreover, constant&#8208;potential kinetics explain a low kinetic barrier under alkaline conditions due to hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the OOH* intermediate and interfacial water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and performance&#8208;oriented design of nonplanar catalysts with precise coordination configurations and presents a complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities for nonplanar materials.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with nonplanar configurations possess unique capabilities for tailoring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance compared with the ones with planar configurations, owing to the additional orbital rearrangement arising from the asymmetric coordination atoms. However, the systematic investigation of these nonplanar SACs has long been hindered by the difficulty in screening feasible nonplanar configurations and precisely controlling the coordination structures. Herein, we demonstrate a combined high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental verification of nonplanar SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) with metal atoms triple&#8208;coordinated by pyrrole&#8208;N, for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis. With the additional p&#8208;orbital rearrangement of N&#8208;ligands for ppy&#8208;MN3 during catalysis, a new descriptor on the energy difference between d&#8208;band center of metal sites and p&#8208;band centers of N&#8208;ligands (&#916;&#1013;d&#8722;p) is proposed to accurately identify the relationship between their catalytic activities and electronic structures, on top of the conventional d&#8208;band center theory. Consequently, ppy&#8208;ZnN3 is identified with excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity (&#951;=0.08&#8197;eV) and selectivity, as well as a low 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic barrier under alkaline condition owing to a strong hydrogen bonding between OOH* intermediate and interfacial water, which is then experimentally verified by its high electrocatalytic H2O2 yield (43&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (92&#8201;%) under alkaline condition. This study thus presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the performance&#8208;oriented and precise coordination design of nonplanar SACs for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, and, more importantly, provides an essential complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities of catalysts with nonplanar configurations for series potential electrochemical processes.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2 Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at Ampere&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use DFT calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni&#8208;RuO2 is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO2 to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface with a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.







Abstract
Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over a 1000&#8208;hour period.

&lt;p&gt;We use DFT calculations to identify Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal-doped M-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface with a strong built-in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere-level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal-doped M-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface having a significant built-in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over a 1000-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Assembly Facilitates the Synthesis of a [12]Cycloparaphenylene ABC&#8208;Type [3]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) represent a significant challenge for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked architectures, because they lack heteroatoms, which precludes traditional active and passive template methods. To circumvent this problem and explore the fundamental and functional properties of CPP rotaxanes and catenanes, researchers have resorted to unusual non&#8208;covalent and even to labor&#8208;intensive covalent template approaches. Herein, we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring non&#8208;covalent template strategy that makes use of the surprisingly strong non&#8208;covalent inclusion of crown ethers into suitably sized CPPs. By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization and the [3]catenane topology was confirmed by NMR and MS&#8208;MS studies. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane, which are highly dependent on the protonation state of the dibenzylammonium site. This ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assembly strategy opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex CPP architectures and their use in functional supramolecular systems.

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspended photothermal Fenton membrane is specifically designed to address the challenges of light attenuation and impurity interference in treating high&#8208;turbidity and colored wastewater. Impressive light utilization and mass transfer allow for continuous operation in a flow reactor for up to 10&#8197;days without any significant decline in actual industrial wastewater.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1&#8197;mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49&#8201;% light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90&#8201;% phenol removal for 15&#8197;days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10&#8197;days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.

Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for methylfuran aromatization (CCMA) was investigated by Anqing Zheng and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202420779). Compared to the individual conversion of methylfuran, CCMA boosts arene formation, enhances catalyst stability, and enables efficient CO2 reduction simultaneously. Employing SVUV&#8208;PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS, operando spectroscopic techniques, and isotopic labeling elucidates key reaction pathways, paving the way for the innovative and efficient valorization of biomass in a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

In their Research Article (e202416088), Holger Helten and co&#8208;authors present a strictly alternating BN&#8208;isostere of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) and well&#8208;defined oligomers. The polymerization was achieved by an AB&#8208;type step&#8208;growth polycondensation of a monomer (illustrated on the top right) featuring one N and one B terminus. The compounds show pronounced fluorescence with hypsochromic shifts with increasing chain length and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties to water (AIEE), solvent polarity and viscosity, temperature, as well as mechanical impact (Cover design: Leonie W&#252;st).

Oligophosphorylated peptides were prepared by Kevin Qian, Bj&#246;rn Hanf, Christopher Cummins, and Dorothea Fiedler in their Research Article (e202419147). Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents are presented that enable the conjugation of multiple phosphates to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths. The picture illustrates different peptides with varying phosphate chain lengths, bearing either a terminal protecting group or a free oligophosphate moiety.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an introduction on the recent development of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs with advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction in terms of the synthetic methods, structure optimization, performance enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
Photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction into high&#8208;value products are promising strategies for addressing both environmental problems and energy crisis. Duo to their advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability, porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as attractive photo/electro&#8208;catalysts towards CO2 reduction. In this review, the research progress of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction is summarized including the design principles, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, this review also presents some challenges and prospects for the application of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs in photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction, laying the base for both fundamental research and application efforts.

Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs) are a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, which have shown great potential in photocatalysis by virtue of their unique features of well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, mild synthesis conditions, easy healing and regeneration. In this Minireview, we summarize the syntheses, structural features and photocatalytic applications for PSCMs, including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation. The challenges and opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance PSCMs&#8208;based photocatalysts are also put forward.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs), such as hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), &#960; frameworks, can be defined as a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Benefiting from the unique features of mild synthesis conditions, well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, easy healing and regeneration, PSCMs have garnered widespread interest in research fields including molecular recognition, sensor, gas storage and separation. Moreover, they have emerged as promising photocatalysts because these PSCMs could be readily endowed with optical function, and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking can offer channels for electron transfer to boost the photocatalytic activity. However, the research on PSCMs for photocatalysis is still at an early stage, and a review on this topic would help to promote the development of supramolecular chemistry. In this Minireview, we first introduce the synthesis methods for PSCMs, and then highlight their advantages in photocatalysis. Subsequently, we summarize the applications of PSCMs in photocatalysis including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation, and we put particular emphasis on delineating the structure&#8208;performance relationship. At the end, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in developing high&#8208;performance PSCM&#8208;based photocatalysts.

As an efficient synthetic strategy, radical rearrangement reactions demonstrate significant potential in the construction of complex valuable molecules. This Minireview summarizes the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) reactions, providing extensive discussion of the reported examples and highlighting the potential of this area







Abstract
Along with the renaissance of radical chemistry, the past decade has witnessed rapid development in radical&#8208;mediated rearrangement reactions. A wide diversity of radical approaches harnessing functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) have been devised to enhance both synthetic efficiency and molecular complexity. However, the application of FGM reactions to construct stereogenic centers remains underexplored owing to the inherent challenges of asymmetric radical reactions. In this Minireview, we summarize the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated FGM reactions. Enantioselectivity can be regulated by chiral substrates, auxiliaries or reagents, or achieved through asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. This synthetic strategy demonstrates its superiority in the production of valuable complex molecules that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional methods.

         <title>Revealing the Potential of a Chimaera: a Peptide&#8208;Peptide Nucleic Acid Molecule Designed To Interact with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can a chimeric molecule mimic RNA and bind an RNA&#8208;binding protein? We designed and synthesized a ligand with a dual nature within the same sequence: a pure peptide component and a peptide nucleic acid one. This chimaera is able to target the construct of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid protein, which comprises the RNA&#8208;binding globular domain and the two flanking disordered regions.







Abstract
Numerous RNA&#8208;binding proteins have modular structures with folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions, making their atomic characterization difficult. This severely limits the investigation of their modalities of interaction as well as the evaluation of possible ways to interfere with this process. We report herein a rational strategy for the design and synthesis of a ligand able to interfere with the protein function, monitoring the interaction through solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our approach employs a chimaera composed of two different fragments, a peptide and a peptide&#8208;nucleic acid, allowing to incorporate in the resulting molecule key features to address RNA&#8208;protein interactions. Focusing on two constructs of the Nucleocapsid protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the globular N&#8208;terminal domain and a more extended one comprising also two flanking intrinsically disordered regions, we demonstrate the enhanced affinity of the designed peptide&#8208;peptide nucleic acid chimaera for the protein compared to a related peptide lacking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contributions within the chain. Furthermore, we emphasize the increasingly recognized relevant and synergistic role of the intrinsically disordered regions in protein&#8208;ligand interaction.

         <title>Stereoselective Preparation and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile preparation of alkenyl sulfoximines, monoaza analogues of sulfones, by condensation of alkyl sulfoximines with aldehydes and their palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling are reported. These alkenyl electrophiles underwent unique oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to Pd to provide alkenes with three substituents. DFT calculations revealed the crucial role of the boronic acid in the transformation.







Abstract
Although numerous transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkenyl electrophiles with a sulfur(VI) leaving group, mainly alkenyl sulfones, have been developed, most rely heavily on highly nucleophilic Grignard reagents, and the use of organoboron reagents remains challenging. We report herein facile preparation and the following Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of alkenyl sulfoximine, a monoaza analog of sulfone. The condensation of alkyl sulfoximine with aldehydes, developed in this study, makes alkenyl sulfoximines more readily available. The resulting alkenes undergo an unprecedented oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to the Pd center. This cross&#8208;coupling proceeds with retention of its original stereochemistry and provided alkenes bearing three different functionalities in a stereoselective fashion. DFT calculations highlight the critical role of boronic acid and in situ&#8208;generated boroxines in facilitating this transformation.

         <dc:description>
We report herein an unprecedented desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;diynes via a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric redox cycloisomerization. This method operates through a novel mechanism involving initiation at the allylic alcohol moiety, and provides efficient access to multi&#8208;functional pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans in high to excellent stereoselectivities. Diverse derivatizations of the heterocyclic products including intriguing skeletal rearrangements have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of Aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Diazosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides have been developed, which has overcome racemic background reaction. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports ligand acceleration. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.

         <title>Contrasting Mechanochromic Luminescence of Enantiopure and Racemic Pyrenylprolinamides: Elucidating Solid&#8208;State Excimer Orientation by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) has been observed for enantiopure and racemic crystals of pyrenylprolinamides with different substituents. Enantiopure crystals exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and mechanochromic CPL was achieved due to the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded excimers in the amorphous state. For the first time, the amorphous&#8208;state CPL was elucidated based on the excimer chirality rule.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) have independently made substantial progress in recent years. However, the exploration of MCL in solid&#8208;state CPL materials, which holds practical significance, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the MCL properties of readily accessible chiral pyrenylprolinamides bearing tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 2,2,2&#8208;trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc) groups. Enantiopure crystals of the Boc derivative display a greater MCL wavelength shift than racemic crystals, while the Troc derivative exhibit the opposite trend. Most notably, the enantiopure crystals show mechanochromic CPL. Unlike in previous examples, where CPL is quenched upon amorphization, robust CPL spectra were observed even in the amorphous states. By applying the excimer chirality rule, we have, for the first time, acquired insights into the excited&#8208;state structures within mechanically generated amorphous states. These findings offer a novel design strategy for developing mechanochromic CPL materials, paving the way for the future advancements in this emerging field.

         <title>High Pressure Synthesis of Pr2O5 &#8211; A Unique Lanthanoid(IV) Oxide Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of PrO2 and oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell afforded the unique oxide peroxide Pr2(O2)O3 in which praseodymium is found in its rare oxidation state of +IV. Pr2(O2)O3 constitutes the most oxygen rich binary phase of any lanthanoid and oxygen. It could be characterised by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction analysis at various pressure points, Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Reacting praseodymium(IV) oxide with oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell yielded the oxide peroxide Pr2IV(O2)O3, which was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on multi&#8208;grain samples, Raman spectroscopy and quantum theoretical calculations at various pressure points. The presence of tetravalent praseodymium ions is supported by electronic structure calculations, showing a band gap of ca. 1.2&#8197;eV, which is consistent with the anticipated chemical model of an ionic solid. Pr2(O2)O3 thus far represents the most oxygen rich phase of any binary compound of a lanthanoid and oxygen and is the first example of a peroxide anion next to Pr4+. Additionally, these results demonstrate that instead of oxidizing the praseodymium ions past their +IV oxidation state, oxygen undergoes a comproportionation to form peroxide anions. Direct oxidation of the oxide anions by Pr4+&#8208;ions was ruled out by a control experiment in argon instead of oxygen, where no oxidation of oxide ions was observed.

         <dc:description>
We have developed a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed lactonization reaction to activate non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in cyclobutene and cyclopropane carboxylic acids. Using a dual ligand approach with pyridone&#8208;phosphine significantly boosts catalyst reactivity, creating a robust catalyst for unsaturated lactonization. This method shows excellent functional group tolerance and offers a straightforward, adaptable synthesis pathway for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactones. Computational studies provided mechanistic insights, identifying the TDI and TDTS, and revealing the role of dual ligands in facilitating the reaction.







Abstract
The activation of non&#8208;polar aliphatic C&#8722;C bonds represents a significant challenge that remains to be addressed in the field of Pd(II) catalysis. In this study, we present a dual ligand approach as a means of addressing this issue. The process entails lactonization of cyclobutane and cyclopropane carboxylic acid via the activation of non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond despite the high feasibility of both &#959;rtho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H and &#946; or &#947; &#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the mechanistic insights and elucidate the role of dual ligands in facilitating this challenging transformation.

The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the meta&#8208;position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the meta&#8208;hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza&#8208;arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3&#8208;position of these dienamine&#8208;type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroglycosylation of Alkynes for the Synthesis of Vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes was developed with bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction, which proceeds by the intermediacy of glycosyl radicals, affords E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity and can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring compounds.







Abstract
Herein we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes, employing bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl (oIB) substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction occurs with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity to afford E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, a class of compounds nontrivial to access by previous methods. The use of a bis(oxazoline) ligand with bulky side chains is critical for the high selectivities observed. Aryl iodides have not been used previously as surrogates for alkyl (glycosyl) electrophiles in Co&#8722;H catalyzed reactions. The transformation features mild reaction conditions, simple reagents, and broad substrate scope. This method can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring products. Mechanistic studies suggest this stereoconvergent process involves glycosyl radicals as key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Fucosylation Enables the Interrogation of the Lea&#8208;LecB Interaction by BioNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis antigen Lea is a selective ligand for Lectin B in P. aeruginosa. Interrogating a key hydrogen bond in this complex has important ramifications for antibiotic research. Through the development of stereoselective fluoro&#8208;fucosylation, it has been possible to design F&#8208;Lea as a structural biology tool. BioNMR analyses with both the native (Lea) and fluorinated (F&#8208;Lea) glycans have unequivocally established the importance of this interaction in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.







Abstract
Fucosylation patterns in cell&#8208;surface glycans are essential mediators of recognition and signalling. Aberrations in these signatures serve as vital diagnostic markers of disease progression, and so understanding fucose&#8208;protein interactions at the molecular level is crucial. Molecular editing of l&#8208;fucose (Fuc) at C2 with fluorine provides a platform to reconcile the ubiquity of fucosylation with the paucity of strategies to interrogate site&#8208;specific interactions. Through judicious introduction of a pseudo&#8208;equatorial fluorine [C(sp3)&#8208;F] adjacent to the anomeric position, &#946;&#8208;selective fucosylation can be achieved with a range of diverse acceptors (&gt;50&#8201;:&#8201;1): the selectivity of this process can be inverted through changes in the donor scaffold. Reaction development was driven by the desire to construct a fluorinated analogue of Lewis antigen a (F&#8208;Lea), in which fluorine replaces a key OH group at C2. Lea is a ligand for Lectin B (LecB) in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus delineating the importance of key interactions in this complex has ramifications for drug discovery. Independent syntheses of Lea and F&#8208;Lea, and systematic bioNMR analyses with both glycans has unequivocally established the essential role of O2 of fucose in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.

         <title>Zeolite Blending: A New Approach to Direct Crystallization of Aluminosilicate Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as raw material in the interzeolite conversion/transformation method resulted in the collection of the required composite building&#8208;units of the CON&#8208;type topology, leading to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).







Abstract
Various synthesis methods for zeolites have been developed to date; however, precise control over aluminum (Al) content remains a significant challenge. For instance, in the case of CON&#8208;type zeolites, it is especially difficult to obtain a Si/Al ratio below a value of approximately 100 by direct synthesis, and below approximately 30 by post&#8208;treatment. In this study, we have developed a novel direct synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite having desired Al content by applying the interzeolite conversion/interzeolite transformation, wherein precursor zeolites that possess common composite building units (CBUs) with the target zeolite are employed as the Al and Si source. Initially, a single zeolite was utilized as a precursor, resulting in the successful synthesis of a high Al CON&#8208;type zeolite (Si/Al=40). Finally, we developed a novel synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite; blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as starting material in the IZC method led to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).

         <title>Putting Charge Transfer Degree as a Bridge Connecting Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy revealed that ZnO with various amounts of copper doping exhibit very high consistency in the photocatalytic activity and the &#961;CT for surface&#8208;absorbed reactant molecules. This study firstly demonstrated the effectiveness of SERS spectroscopy based on the CT enhancement mechanism in predicting the interfacial CT process in semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions.







Abstract
To date, few systematic approach has been established for predicting catalytic performance by analyzing the spectral information of molecules adsorbed on photocatalyst surfaces. Effective charge transfer (CT) between the semiconductor photocatalysts and surface&#8208;absorbed molecules is essential for enhancing catalytic activity and optimizing light energy utilization. This study aimed to validate the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based on the CT enhancement mechanism in investigating the CT process during semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions. A copper ion doping strategy was employed to simultaneously enhance the SERS effect and catalytic activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) derived from metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). By analyzing molecular fingerprint SERS spectra, we calculated the degree of CT (&#961;CT), revealing that SERS enhancement is attributed to the CT mechanism. In situ SERS spectra confirmed a high correlation between the catalytic activity and &#961;CT of ZnO with varying copper ion doping levels. A range of photoelectric and spectroscopic tests validated the effectiveness of SERS in linking CT to photocatalytic performance, consistent with first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This finding is also validated in other semiconductor materials and catalytic reactions, demonstrating the broad applicability of &#961;CT for predicting and evaluating SERS and catalytic activity.

         <title>Helical Quintulene: Synthesis, Chirality, and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical, bowl&#8208;shaped extended quintulene (1) was synthesized by incomplete dehydrocyclization, revealing quintuple [5]helicenes fused at the rim. Chiroptical studies on 1 demonstrated strong dissymmetry in both the absorption and luminescence. The bowl shape of 1 enables supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerene. These findings expand the structural diversity of quintulene and represent the first example of a cycloarene fused with helicenes.







Abstract
Quintulene is a quintuply symmetrical cycloarene with a positively curved molecular geometry. First described by Staab and Sauer in 1984, its successful synthesis was not achieved until 2020. Due to the challenges posed by its positive curvature, structural extensions of quintulene have been studied rarely. In this work, we report the synthesis of a chiral quintulene (1) featuring five [5]helicene units at its rim constructed through the introduction of steric hindrance. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the structure of 1 that showcases a unique chirality combining helicity and rotational symmetry. The enantiomers of 1 were separated and their chiroptical properties were examined, revealing the dissymmetric absorption and luminescence. Additionally, the bowl shape facilitates supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerenes, with a binding constant to C60 10&#8208;fold higher than to C70. This work expands the structural diversity of quintulene and bridges the structures of cycloarenes and multi&#8208;helicenes, paving the way for the structural design of chiral cycloarenes.

         <title>Manipulating the dynamics of chiral molecular bearings through subtle structural changes of guest molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isotropic rotation of a diamondoid molecule within a cylinder array was hindered by subtle structural changes introduced through a fluorine substituent. This bias in rotation induced precession with its direction controlled by an external electric field.







Abstract
By introducing fluorine substituents, anisotropic rotational motion was induced in diamondoid guests trapped in cylindrical hosts arranged in a 2D honeycomb crystal. Despite the subtle structural changes, the substituent hindered flipping motions in the host and biased its rotations toward tilted precession. The fluorine substituent facilitated the dielectric response of the crystal, as revealed through dielectric constant measurements, which provided insight into the detailed dynamics of the anisotropic rotations. The up&#8208;down flipping motion of the guest within the 2D crystal was constrained by an energy barrier but remained manipulable under an external electric field. Consequently, the angular momentum of the spinning guest, with its C&#8722;F pole, was forced to align with the applied electric field.

         <title>Enhanced Azo Dye Removal through Sequential Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted&#8208;Treatment and Photocatalysis Using CdZnS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sequential adsorption&#8208;photocatalytic system for the efficient degradation of complex dye mixtures in concentrated wastewater, showcasing enhanced removal kinetics and superior pollutant&#8208;catalyst interaction.







Abstract
The treatment of high&#8208;concentration azo dyes remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional single&#8208;mode approaches. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that sequentially combines ultrasound&#8208;assisted adsorption with photocatalysis using CdZnS solid solutions to efficiently and rapidly remove high&#8208;concentration azo dyes. CdZnS exhibits high adsorption capacity and exceptional photocatalytic activity, enabling initial dye capture and enrichment, followed by significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption of Congo Red (CR) on CdZnS solid solutions follows the Freundlich and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order models, demonstrating a multilayer adsorption behavior involving physical and chemical interactions. Ultrasound assistance during the first stage not only significantly reduces equilibrium time, but also results in enhanced negative charges in CdZnS that extend to the subsequent photocatalysis stage. This charge enhancement substantially improves CR photodegradation performance, establishing synergistic interactions between ultrasonic treatment and photodegradation. The system demonstrates excellent performance in treating both concentrated single dyes and complex dye mixtures, maintaining high efficiency over multiple treatment cycles. This integrated approach provides new insights for developing more effective technologies for dye degradation and practical wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Semirational Protein Engineering of a Decarboxylative Aldolase for the Regiodivergent and Stereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclic Imino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative aldolase UstD was semirationally engineered through a focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy. The obtained mutant showed complementary regioselectivity and stereoselectivity to the wild&#8208;type UstD, which enabled the divergent synthesis of cyclic imino acids in excellent yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Aldolases are powerful C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes for asymmetric organic synthesis because of their supreme stereoselectivity, compatibility with diverse electrophiles and nucleophiles, and promising scalability. Stereodivergent engineering of aldolases to tune the selectivity for the synthesis of stereoisomers of chiral molecules is highly desirable but has rarely been reported. Herein we report the semirational engineering of the decarboxylative aldolase UstD with a focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to perform a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reaction with dione electrophiles. The variant obtained from a small mutant library showed divergent regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, resulting in the production of 30 cyclic imino acids with stereocenters at the &#945; and &#947; positions. Molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic data revealed the basis of selectivity.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosome SMLM Imaging as Indicators for Functional Diagnostics with a Low&#8208;Phototoxic Spontaneously Blinking Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR spontaneously blinking fluorophore, Aze&#8208;HMSiR, optimized for long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomes is developed. It exhibits superior photostability, pH responsiveness, and minimal phototoxicity. Aze&#8208;HMSiR can reveal key lysosomal characteristics, including distribution, size, and lumen pH, in response to various anticancer agents. Such whole&#8208;cell lysosome SMLM imaging serves as a valuable indicator for lysosomal functional diagnostics.








Abstract
Lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics are key indicators of lysosomal function, making long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging a promising tool for functional diagnostics. However, phototoxicity often compromises imaging reliability. Here, we develop Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a spontaneously blinking silicon rhodamine probe with near&#8208;infrared excitation, enabling low&#8208;phototoxicity, long&#8208;term (50 min) SMLM imaging of lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics. This probe provides super&#8208;resolution insights into lysosomal distribution, size, and lumen pH, essential for understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Using Aze&#8208;HMSiR, we investigate lysosomal function under acidosis, starvation, and anticancer drug treatments. Among seven tested drugs, periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while paclitaxel increased pH and altered lysosomal distribution. These findings highlight Aze&#8208;HMSiR as a powerful tool for lysosomal functional diagnostics and drug screening, offering a robust platform for studying lysosomal dynamics in response to physiological and pharmacological perturbations, particularly in cancer therapy.

         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient recycling strategy is developed, where a commercially available boron catalyst is used to selectively break C(sp3)&#9472;O bond in epoxy resins to recover bisphenol A, and the other part of epoxy resin is recovered as epoxy monomers by the reconstruction of C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and hydroxyl cyclization, realizing the high&#8208;value and full recovery of epoxy resins.








Abstract
Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a full recovery strategy for the conversion of EPs into high&#8208;value platform compounds, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA) and epoxy monomers such as 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80), which involves the selective breaking of the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond using commercially available boron trichloride (BCl3), the reconstruction of the broken C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and the cyclization of the hydroxy groups. The yield of BPA is 93 wt% with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100% recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Because of its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and by&#8208;products, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.

         <title>Iron Single&#8208;Atom Based Double&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Center Catalysis Triggers Internal&#8208;Driven and External&#8208;Driven Pathways for Green Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron single atoms in double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs)&#8208;based catalysts substituted the oxidants and dissolved oxygen as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07, and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere.








Abstract
Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate [PMS] addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.

         <title>&#8220;Pulsed&#8221; Chain Transfer Anionic Polymerization: A Green and Cost&#8208;Effective Approach for Controlled Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy significantly enhances catalyst atom economy in living polymerization by introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions. The temperature&#8208;sensitive catalytic system allows multiple regenerations of the initiator without using expensive organometallic compounds such as ZnEt2 or MgBu2. This green and cost&#8208;effective approach achieves up to 1500% initiator efficiency and enables the synthesis of polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, providing a sustainable alternative for producing well&#8208;defined, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. 








Abstract
Herein, we report a method that significantly enhances the atom economy of catalysts in living polymerization. By introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions during the polymerization process, multiple regenerations of the catalyst are achieved while preserving the &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled characteristics. The specially designed catalytic system, composed of 1,2&#8208;dipyrrolidinoethane/n&#8208;butyllithium/n&#8208;butylpotassium/toluene, exhibits a chain&#8208;transfer rate that is highly sensitive to temperature. It enables living polymerization at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, rapid chain transfer to toluene occurs. Utilizing this characteristic, polymerization is initially carried out at low temperatures; once the monomer is consumed, increasing the temperature promotes chain transfer, resulting in initiator regeneration. The regenerated initiator can then initiate new cycles of living polymerization upon the addition of fresh monomers. This process was repeated for more than a dozen cycles, achieving an initiator efficiency of up to 1500%. Using this method, we successfully synthesized polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymer with an extremely narrow molecular weight distribution (&#272; = 1.1). The mechanism was investigated by in situ NMR spectroscopy, MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations. This approach is particularly well&#8208;suited for the controllable, green, and cost&#8208;effective production of low&#8208; to medium&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers and block copolymers.

         <title>Highly Ordered Polymorphism of Small Molecule Acceptor Delivering Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach employing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive enables the formation of highly ordered BTP&#8208;eC9 polymorphic crystals at low annealing temperatures. This enhances PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 active layer morphology, achieving a PCE of 20.32% with antireflection layers and exceptional device stability, advancing scalable strategies for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Advancements in narrow bandgap organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies beyond 20%. Achieving this milestone necessitates precise control over the active layer morphology, particularly its crystallinity and phase distribution, to optimize light absorption, charge transport, and suppress charge recombination. However, controlling SMA morphology remains a significant challenge due to their strong aggregation tendency. Existing methods, including high&#8208;temperature annealing, and introducing high boiling point additives, frequently yield disordered polymorphs with limited scalability. Here, we report a novel approach of utilizing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive to induce the formation of a highly ordered polymorph of BTP&#8208;eC9 through mild annealing at 60 &#176;C. This marks the first demonstration of such an ordered SMA polymorph, exhibiting optical properties comparable to ideal crystals, including enhanced anisotropy, refractive index, and extinction coefficients. The specific polymorph further enables the formation of a well&#8208;organized PM6 donor arrangement, establishing an optimal bicontinuous network morphology. Consequently, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.53%, which further increases to 20.32% with the addition of an antireflection layer. This work provides a scalable and effective strategy for enhancing OSC performance and highlights the critical role of polymorphism in optimizing photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating&#8208;Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH + NH3&#8221; step with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation is realized through &#960; back donation on Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the by&#8208;product formation for boosting NH3 synthesis.








Abstract
The general understanding on the reaction path is that the electrocatalytic&#160;N2 reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N2 activation and selective NH3 production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH&#160;+&#160;NH3&#8221; step to boost NH3 synthesis with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst.

&lt;p&gt;An unconventional &#8220;alternating-distal&#8221; hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; step with an amorphous CeMnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation is realized through &#960; back donation on Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the by-product formation for boosting NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general understanding on the reaction path is that the electrocatalytic&#160;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and selective NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating-distal&#8221; pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH&#160;+&#160;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; step to boost NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis with an amorphous CeMnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen-containing by-product formation.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Fused Propellanes: A Geometrically Rigid Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Amplified Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two geometrically rigid 3D nanocarbons comprising three &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene subunits fused on a [3,3,3]propellane have been synthesized and characterized. The resulting nanocarbons display high solubility and a very stable configuration. Notably, the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties of the nanocarbons are significantly improved relative to the reference &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene.








Abstract
Here we report the synthesis of a geometrically distinct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral nanocarbon, which is composed of three &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene subunits fused on a [3,3,3]propellane with P,P,M/M,M,P configurations in the helicene subunits. This nanocarbon can isomerize into the thermodynamically more stable isomer with PPP/MMM configurations in the helicene subunits. Both 3D nanocarbons display a very stable configuration, which can be separated by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Notably, the nanocarbons display significantly enhanced chiroptical properties compared to the reference &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene, due to the improved alignment of magnetic and electric transition dipole moments. The twisted [6]helicene subunits in the nanocarbon provide concave surfaces that are suitable&#8212;albeit relatively weak&#8212;hosts for C60, forming a 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex in the solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Valence Engineering via Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced on Vanadium Centers for Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study synthesized a series of novel nanostructures with polyoxometalates (POMs) inserted into vanadate&#8208;based compounds via a solvothermal method to achieve uniform dispersion of POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds. The electronic synergistic effect between the POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds effectively reduced the Zn2&#8314; migration barrier and accelerated Zn2&#8314; migration on the cathode, resulting in a high specific capacity. This work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Layered vanadium&#8208;based compounds have attracted attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundant vanadium valence states. However, the slow migration of Zn2+ ions and their poor cycling stability hinder their practical application in AZIBs. Herein, using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method, the polyoxometalates (POMs) were inserted into the aluminum vanadate interlayer spacing, and a series of novel 3D nanoflower cathode materials (HAVO&#8208;MMo6&#8208;X) were successfully fabricated. The unique electron&#8208;rich structure of the POMs accelerated the migration of Zn2+ on the cathode to obtain a high specific capacity. Owing to the synergistic pillar effect of POMs and HAVO, the interlayer spacing of HAVO&#8208;FeMo6&#8208;50 increased to approximately 14.33&#160;&#197;. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to analyze the coordination environments of the cathode materials. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques demonstrated the storage mechanism of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the introduction of POMs had the dual function of improving conductivity and reducing the Zn2+ migration barrier. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

This work demonstrates an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise electrostatic catalysis, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and reveal the crucial role of the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This study offers a unique route to discover novel phenomena and unveil the intrinsic mechanisms in the processes of material transformation and life activities.








Abstract
A central goal of chemical mechanism research is to provide a comprehensive interpretation of chemical reaction pathways to clarify the evolution patterns of reactions. In this work, we present an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise control of oriented external electric fields, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and elucidate their roles in the reaction. Both temperature&#8208; and isotope&#8208;dependent experiments, in combination with theoretical simulations, reveal crucial roles for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer and the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This work highlights the precise manipulation of chemical reactions by electrostatic fields and opens up a universal route to discover unknown intermediates or novel phenomena in the processes of material transformation and life activities.

         <title>Repurposing Post&#8208;Consumer Polyethylene to Access Cross&#8208;Linked Polyethylene with Reprocessability, Recyclability, and Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successfully repurposing mixed post&#8208;consumer PE into crosslinked PE (XLPE) with reprocessability, chemical recyclability, tunable properties, and potential degradability is achieved. The approach involves catalytically converting PE into telechelic oligomers with hydroxyl chain&#8208;end groups. Subsequent cross&#8208;linking the oligomers or their mixture with commercial macrodiols using hybrid cross&#8208;linkers provides XLPE with the modular properties.








Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced plastic but accumulation and resistance to degradation has significantly contributed to the plastic waste crisis. Upcycling has presented promising solutions to transform PE waste into value&#8208;added products. In this study, mixed post&#8208;consumer PE was successfully repurposed into reprocessable and chemically recyclable cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE). This process involved converting PE into telechelic oligomers, followed by repolymerization using a hybrid cross&#8208;linking system consisting of a dynamic cross&#8208;linker 2,4,6&#8208;triethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TETA) and non&#8208;dynamic cross&#8208;linker tris(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)isocyanurate (Tri&#8208;HDI). In the resulting XLPE, TETA facilitated iterative reprocessing with minimal property degradation across cycles, whereas Tri&#8208;HDI helped preserve functional performance throughout service life. Compared to PE, XLPE exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, reduced creep deformation under application&#8208;relevant temperatures, and high temperature structural stability. Notably, copolymerizing PE oligomers with commercial macrodiols was employed to create composite XLPEs, enabling tuning material properties. After use, XLPE can be efficiently and selectively depolymerized under mild conditions, even when mixed with commercial insulator cables. This depolymerization allows for the recovery of the constituent building blocks, enabling purification and subsequent repolymerization for reuse. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing plastic waste into sustainable materials and fostering the development of a circular economy.

Notably, copolymerizing PE oligomers with commercial macrodiols was employed to create composite XLPEs, enabling tuning material properties. After use, XLPE can be efficiently and selectively depolymerized under mild conditions, even when mixed with commercial insulator cables. This depolymerization allows for the recovery of the constituent building blocks, enabling purification and subsequent repolymerization for reuse. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing plastic waste into sustainable materials and fostering the development of a circular economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retarding Phase Segregation via Lattice Reinforcement for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stable perovskite lattice was achieved by incorporating DMA+, which suppresses the halide phase segregation under both high&#8208;power illumination and high&#8208;bias voltage. The resultant perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with active areas of 0.062 and 1.004 cm2 achieved remarkable PCEs of 26.15% (certified: 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, and showed excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with T90 of &#8764;1350&#160;h.








Abstract
The operational perovskite/organic tandems are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single&#8208;junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA+) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA+ with a larger ionic radius entering the A&#8208;site of lattice tilts the [PbX6]4&#8722; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#9472;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high&#8208;power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting values, delivering a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.34&#160;V. Notably, 0.062&#8208;cm2 and 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieved remarkable efficiencies of 26.15% (certified of 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, exhibiting excellent operational stability of T90 &#8764; 1350&#160;h.

         <title>Trap&#8208;Enabled Long Exciton Lifetime in Low&#8208;Toxicity Quantum Dots for Enhanced Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing surface traps onto the low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based quantum dots, the excitation energy circulates between exciton states and trap states, leading to trap&#8208;state&#8208;mediated thermally activated delayed photoluminescence. The applications of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction were achieved by leveraging the long excited&#8208;state lifetime of delayed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Prolonging exciton lifetime in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is crucial to their photochemical applications. Previously, this was achieved through a mechanism called thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) for QDs surface&#8208;anchored with molecular triplet energy acceptors, in which the molecular triplets sensitized by QDs can repopulate QD&#8208;excitons through thermally activated reverse energy transfer. Here, we demonstrate a novel TADPL mechanism achieved by engineering the surface trap states of QDs. Rapid exciton trapping and thermally activated slow detrapping prolong the exciton lifetime of low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based QDs from the timescale of &#8764;10&#160;ns to &#8764;100&#160;&#181;s. Such a long exciton lifetime allows direct engagement of QDs in diffusion&#8208;assisted energy transfer, without needing surface&#8208;anchored molecules as triplet transmitters, for solution&#8208;phase photochemical applications such as photon upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition. This advantage not only greatly streamlines the design of QD&#8208;based photochemical systems but also avoids the reliability issue associated with the anchoring between QDs and molecules, as well as enabling facile tuning of the TADPL wavelength range not limited by the availability of molecular triplet acceptors.

         <title>Unravelling the Oxygen Evolution Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antifluorite Prelithiation Agent Based on Anionic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The illustration of the intricate oxygen evolution mechanism of antifluorite Li5FeO4 (LFO) prelithiation agent, which is originally explained in a variety of novel and unconventional perspectives: lattice mismatch induced by the coexistence of Fe&#8208;O tetrahedral (tet.) and octahedral (oct.) activate the lattice oxygen, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O&#8722; configurations dimerize to superoxide and O2, the nucleophilic reaction between superoxide and electrolyte contributes to cathode electrolyte interface (CEI), the oxidized O species shuttle to the anode side participating in the construction of solid electrolyte interface (SEI).








Abstract
Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for irreversible lithium loss is crucial for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Antifluorite Li&#8208;rich Li5FeO4 (LFO) is a promising prelithiation agent due to its high theoretical capacity (867 mAh g&#8722;1) and superior decomposition dynamic (&lt;4.0&#160;V vs. Li/Li+). However, the oxygen evolution mechanism in LFO remains unclear, limiting its application as an ideal prelithiation agent. Herein, we systematically track the full lifecycle oxygen footprint in LFO lattice, electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface (SEI). We demonstrate the lattice mismatch induced by the quasi&#8208;disorder rocksalt intermediate phase can activate the lattice oxygen oxidation promoting the dimerization to O2. Specifically, in contrast to the O&#9472;O dimers formed within typical anionic&#8208;redox active cathodes, the oxidation of lattice oxygen in LFO generates O&#8722; stabilized in Li6&#8208;O configuration. Significantly, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O configurations transforms into a superoxo dimer, which further evolves into O2 via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process. Moreover, we demonstrate that nucleophilic intermediates threaten the stability of electrolytes and SEI. Leveraging the insights above, we offer comprehensive perspectives for the modification of ideal prelithiation agents.

         <title>Hybrid Linking Sites Constructed Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Asymmetric Dimerized Giant Molecule Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with an Efficiency of &#8776;20%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid linking site engineering was developed for the first time to construct nonfully conjugated asymmetric dimeric giant molecule acceptor (GMA) named 2Y&#8208;we, and the related organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.9%, which is the highest value in the reported non&#8208;fully conjugated GMAs to date.








Abstract
Linking&#8208;site engineering, used to graft two or more monomers, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;series giant molecule acceptors (Y&#8208;GMAs). However, the reported Y&#8208;GMAs all use a single&#8208;typed linking site, making it difficult to finely&#8208;tune their optoelectronic properties. Herein, we develop a non&#8208;fully conjugated Y&#8208;GMA (named 2Y&#8208;we), with hybrid linking sites at the wing and end&#8208;group of monomers, to combine the respective advantages of the wing and end&#8208;group site linked counterparts. Compared to its parental monomer, 2Y&#8208;we shows different intermolecular interactions, crystallinity, packing, and glass transition temperature, allowing optimized active layer morphology (including appropriate phase separation and ordered molecular packing) and stability. Consequently, the D18/2Y&#8208;we&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) obtain an improved power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of 17.4% with both higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC), due to the reduced energy loss and efficient exciton dissociation. Inspired by its high VOC&#160;&#215;&#160;JSC, 2Y&#8208;we is introduced into D18:L8&#8208;BO to fabricate ternary devices. Thanks to the further optimized morphology and improved charge transport, the ternary OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 19.9%, which is the highest value among the reported nonfully conjugated Y&#8208;GMAs. Our developed hybrid linking&#8208;site engineering for constructing high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;GMAs offers an approach to boost device efficiency.

         <title>Unusual 1,1&#8208;Dicarboxylation Selectivity in the Domino Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with Formate and Application in Polyimide Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes using cesium formate and water was disclosed for the first time. The dicarboxylation reaction undergoes via &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to an acrylic acid intermediate. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids, succinic acids, and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. It may provide a new working mode for positive&#8208;type photoresists for photolithographic processing.








Abstract
We report for the first time a photoinduced domino 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of malonic acid derivatives using a cesium formate solution (80% w/w in water), which is different from previous 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylation methods that usually produce succinic acids. Cesium malonate precipitated directly from the diluted reaction mixture and was collected by filtration without further purification. Interestingly, solid cesium formate with additional water led to a mono&#8208;carboxylation product. The solubility of cesium formate and alkaline environment are two key factors contributing to the outcome. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. Mechanism experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the malonic acid is formed through the &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to a cinnamate intermediate. This method enables direct preparation of water&#8208;soluble carboxylate&#8208;functionalized molecules and polymers from hydrophobic alkyne&#8208;containing precursors, showing potential usability in photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>Anomalous Magnetic Hysteresis up to 20&#160;K in a Non&#8208;Kramers Light&#8208;Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first praseodymium (Pr) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) is designed and synthesized by confining single non&#8208;Kramers light&#8208;lanthanide Pr(III) inside an azafullerene cage, which shows an anomalously high&#8208;temperature magnetic bistability up to 20&#160;K, the highest value among all reported light&#8208;lanthanide SMMs, without employing a demanding strong axial ligand field.








Abstract
Light&#8208;lanthanides (Ln), despite their widespread uses in commercial permanent magnets, are among the least explored metal elements as building blocks of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their smaller magnetic moments as well as weaker spin&#8211;orbit couplings than those of the heavy&#8208;Ln counterparts, and so far, only a neodymium (Nd) complex has been reported showing a small magnetic hysteresis at 2&#160;K. Here, we report a low&#8208;coordination praseodymium (Pr) complex, namely, Pr@C81N, featuring a non&#8208;Kramers trivalent Pr ion entrapped within an azafullerene cage and behaving as the first Pr&#8208;based SMM. Although the weak nonaxial ligand field imposed only by the carbon cage on the integer&#8208;spin Pr(III) elicits nondegenerate spin states, Pr@C81N shows an anomalous magnetic hysteresis up to 20&#160;K using a field sweep rate of 20&#160;Oe/s, which is the highest temperature among all reported light&#8208;Ln SMMs. In addition to the ideally minimized spin&#8211;phonon coupling in the low coordination, the origin of such an unexpected magnetic bistability for the non&#8208;Kramers complex likely lies in nuclear sublevels arising from a large Pr hyperfine coupling, which feature distinct electronic magnetizations within the highly mixed ground electronic state.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Degradation of Polycaprolactone into Adipic Acids over Pt/TiO2 in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy is presented to achieve upcycling of polycaprolactone (PCL) to adipic acid (AA) using Pt/TiO2 as a catalyst in water with [BMIm][NTf2] via hydrolysis of PCL and subsequent oxidation, achieving complete conversion of PCL with an AA yield of 85.60%.








Abstract
Upgrading polyester waste into high value&#8208;added chemicals can achieve carbon recycling, which is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot protocol to oxidatively degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) with air into adipic acid (AA) mediated by ionic liquid (IL, e.g., 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [BMIm][NTf2]) in water. In this protocol, IL catalyzes the hydrolysis of PCL into 6&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid (6&#8208;HHA) and further mediates the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA into AA over TiO2&#8208;supported Pt nanocatalysts, reaching the highest AA yield of 85.6% under relatively mild conditions (140&#160;&#176;C, 1.5&#160;MPa). Mechanism investigation indicates that both O2&#8226;&#8211; and &#8226;OH derived from oxygen and water are involved in the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA to form 6&#8208;oxohexanoic acid via two pathways, which further convert into AA. The IL inhibits the overoxidation of AA, thus leading to a high selectivity toward AA. This protocol provides a green and feasible way to degrade PCL and also to access AA.

         <title>Elucidating Relay Catalysis on Copper Clusters With Satellite Single Atoms for Enhanced Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the relay catalysis for urea electrosynthesis on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC, &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites convert NO3&#8722; to *NOx, and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites promote water dissociation, yielding *H for *NOx hydrogenation. The resultant *NH2 then couples with *CO2 activated by &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites, facilitating an efficient cascade catalysis for urea production. This process highlights the synergy between &#8220;CuAC&#8221; and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites in enhancing catalytic performance.








Abstract
Relay catalysis represents significant efficacy in alleviating competition among different reactants during coupling reactions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism underlying relay catalysis for the urea electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, we have developed a catalyst (CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC) comprising Cu atomic clusters (CuAC) with satellite Cu&#9472;N4 single atoms (CuSA) sites on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous interconnected carbon skeleton (NC), enabling elucidation of a relay catalysis process for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The designed CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC catalyst exhibits an approximately threefold higher urea yield rate compared to that of CuSA@NC at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V versus RHE. Ex&#8208;situ experimental results and in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy analysis reveal a formation sequence between the *NH2 and *NH2CO species on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC with increasing reduction potential. The combination of theoretical calculations further elucidates that the relay catalysis pathway involves &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites facilitating the conversion of *NO3 to *NOx, followed by a hydrogenation process to form *NH2 with *H from water dissociation promoted by &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites, which subsequently couples with *CO2 to produce urea. This work provides novel insights into the investigation of coupling reactions, but not limit to, urea synthesis.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Minute Fabrication of Metal Organic Framework Membranes via Additive&#8208;Accelerated Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sub&#8208;minute fabrication of permselective metal organic framework membranes via additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition is developed by using catecholamine as both biomimetic mineralization inducer and grain&#8208;boundary adhesive. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8@DA membranes exhibited excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with C3H6 permeance of 145&#160;&#177;&#160;12 GPU and C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151&#160;&#177;&#160;8, surpassing most of MOF membranes.








Abstract
Efficient fabrication of metal organic framework (MOF) membranes is important for their broad applications in molecular separations. However, current approaches for MOF membrane fabrication are usually time&#8208;consuming due to the slow, random nucleation and crystal growth, particularly the lack of in&#8208;situ defect healing ability. Here, we report an additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition method, which allows ultrafast fabrication of MOF membranes through the synergy of electric field and catecholamine additives. The strong electric field facilitates the directed nucleation of MOF on the substrates while the multifunctional additives accelerate the MOF crystallization, growth and grain&#8208;boundary defect healing. Consequently, we fabricate well&#8208;intergrown, uniform MOF (ZIF&#8208;8) membranes with an ultrathin thickness of &#8764;180&#160;nm in 30 s, which is the most rapid fabrication of MOF membranes till now. The membranes exhibit superior C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with a C3H6 permeance of 145 GPU and a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151, as well as good stability at high pressure of 7&#160;bar, and the ultrafast membrane fabrication can be achieved on commercial ceramic substrates, exhibiting the potential for practical applications. This work may establish a platform for fast and controllable fabrication of MOF membranes as well as many other membranes based on metal&#8208;coordination chemistry.

         <title>Electrochemical Pilot H2O2 Production by Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Reactor: Insights From a Hybrid Catalyst for 2&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined transition metal hydroxides (NiFeW LDH, NiFe LDH, Ni(OH)&#8322;) with OCNTs electrocatalysts, carefully designed water dissociation active centers, and employed an innovative membrane&#8208;free microchannel CER electrolyte configuration to generate pure H&#8322;O&#8322; in a pilot electrolyzer, achieving an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 15 A and 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8722;1.








Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers an alluring and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process for hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) synthesis. However, challenges remain in developing scalable electrocatalysts and cost&#8208;effective reactors for high&#8208;purity H&#8322;O&#8322; production. This study introduces a simple yet effective mechanical mixing method to fabricate a hybrid electrocatalyst from oxidized carbon nanotubes and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). This easily accessible and low&#8208;cost catalyst achieves near&#8208;perfect Faradaic efficiency (&#8764;100%) with low overpotentials of 73&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 and 588&#160;mV at 400&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 in a solid electrolyte cell. Through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ analyses, we uncover the pivotal role played by the LDH co&#8208;catalyst in fine&#8208;tuning the local pH at the catalyst/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface that drives both the activity and selectivity. We also design a low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state reactor using cation&#8208;exchange resin (CER) as both a proton conductor and a microchannel for efficient mass transfer, achieving a production rate of 5.29&#160;mmol cm&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; and continuous output concentrations of 11.8&#160;wt.% H&#8322;O&#8322;. Scaled to an industrial area of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;100 cm2, the pilot reactor achieves an impressive H&#8322;O&#8322; production rate of approximately 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; at 15 A, marking a significant advancement in sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; production.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 is reported for the electrohydrogenation of olefins under unusual high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source and reductant, respectively. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Additionally, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a powerful and sustainable alternative to conventional chemical manufacturing techniques. The direct and selective electrohydrogenation of olefins has enormous potential applicability; however, this reactivity has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Herein, we show that an efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 can promote such transformations. This approach enables olefins to be electrohydrogenated (often below &#8722;3.0&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility, requires low catalyst loading, and affords a diverse series of valuable molecules (more than 60 examples) with high chemoselectivity. In addition, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.

         <title>Leveraging Solvent Effects for Enhanced Oxidation and Coordination in Selective Piezocatalytic Gold Recovery from End&#8208;of&#8208;Life Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The choice of solvent in piezocatalytic Au extraction is critical to electron transfer, radical generation, and mass transport. The CH3CN&#8211;water solvent system emerges as the optimal medium, achieving a balance of oxidation ability, coordination ability, scalability, and environmental safety, resulting in a highly efficient and selective Au recovery.








Abstract
Efficient gold (Au) recovery from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) under environmentally sustainable and mild conditions presents a significant challenge in resource recycling. This study introduced a novel piezocatalytic method for Au recovery from E&#8208;waste using a mixed acetonitrile&#8211;water (CH3CN&#8208;H2O) solution. The findings emphasize the crucial role of solvent effects in modulating catalytic performance, with a 75% CH3CN solution offering the most efficient recovery. The solvent not only influenced the oxidation and coordination steps crucial for Au extraction but also facilitated electron and mass transfer, accelerating the generation of reactive species that promote Au dissolution. Furthermore, water amplified the effect of the solvent by modifying the chemical potential of surface species, thus optimizing catalytic reactivity. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezocatalytic system achieved 100% Au recovery from various types of E&#8208;waste, exhibiting excellent adaptability across a broad pH range. Large&#8208;scale experiments at the kilogram level confirmed its practicality, with 100% recovery from printed circuit boards and 98% from central processing unit boards. This study underscores the importance of solvent effects in piezocatalysis and provides new insights into the sustainable recovery of precious metals, thereby paving the way for the design of solvent&#8208;assisted catalytic systems.

         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of structurally diverse quinones led to defining key physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions that drive type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2)&#8208;dependent extracellular electron transfer activity in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Analysis of lead quinones in bioelectrochemical systems revealed that the amine&#8208;containing compounds can produce stable current profiles for up to 5 days.

Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is known to utilize exogenous small molecule quinone mediators to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), allowing it to produce a detectable current in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2); however, structural variations in the core of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone EET mediators have shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone&#8208;based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (&#916;Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and &#916;Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum, and each generated Ndh2&#8208;dependent current over background signal. Importantly, an amine&#8208;containing mediator yielded incredibly stable current output over the course of the experiment (up to 5 days). These findings improve our understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships for quinone&#8208;mediated EET and provide stable mediators for bioelectronic sensing applications.

         <title>Isomeric 1,4&#8208;Dihydropentalene&#8208;Containing Building Blocks for High Mobility Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of two novel isomeric derivatives of 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indeneo (DHI), incorporating a thieno group to reduce torsional disorder. The anti&#8208;C16DHIT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT isomers differ in conjugation characteristics, with the anti&#8208;isomer showing fully delocalized conjugation, whereas syn isomer exhibiting cross&#8208;conjugation. The polymer based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT exhibits high hole mobility of 2.38 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing that of pIDTBT in same device structure.








Abstract
Nearly amorphous conjugated polymers, though lacking long&#8208;range order, can exhibit high charge carrier mobility and enhanced flexibility, making them ideal for flexible or stretchable OFET applications. However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent comonomers. The two 1,4&#8208;dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti&#8208;isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, whereas the syn isomer exhibits cross&#8208;conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT. Devices based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, slightly higher than the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.

         <title>Elucidating the Boundary of Intercalation vs Sequestration in Supramolecular Polymers by Retrosynthetic Design Toward the Construction of Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By retrosynthetically analyzing the molecular structure of an intercalator, clear design principles toward supramolecular sequestration can be obtained. Investigating a model supramolecular polymer in the presence of these additives offers a general approach toward dilution&#8208;induced polymerization and complex hybrid systems of dual sequestration and hybrid mechanisms of sequestration and intercalation.








Abstract
Controlled social self&#8208;sorting by intercalation can offer distinct properties at the supramolecular level that go beyond the sum of its parts. Likewise, controlling narcissistic self&#8208;sorting by sequestration can induce unique system properties. In contrast, the interface between the two cases has hitherto remained underexplored, and clear design rules remain elusive. Herein it is demonstrated that by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular similarity of supramolecular synthons, intricate control over concerted supramolecular equilibria can be achieved. By reducing the molecular similarity, a former intercalator can be tuned to become a strong or weak sequestrator. Understanding these roles in binary mixtures allows to rationalize more complex tertiary systems. Consequently, the influence of an uncommon dual sequestration mechanism is revealed. Further, an unprecedented hybrid mechanism between supramolecular intercalation and sequestration can be demonstrated. We are hopeful that the results presented herein will contribute to the development and understanding of concerted processes in complex supramolecular systems.

         <dc:description>
B, F, P, S, and N co&#8208;doped high&#8208;entropy nanocarbon (HENC) is synthesized through ZIF&#8208;8 modification and pyrolysis. It exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction, rivaling Pt/C, and notable stability. Simulations highlight synergistic heteroatom effects and entropy enhancement, with N, P, and S as crucial active sites. In zinc&#8211;air batteries, HENC achieves a peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2, surpassing Pt/C (542 mW cm&#8722;2), while maintaining durability. This study introduces a novel route for high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective catalysts.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co&#8208;doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in situ polymerization modification of ZIF&#8208;8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a nonmetal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all&#8208;site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O2 species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co&#8208;doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2 and demonstrating long&#8208;term stability over a 16&#8208;day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high&#8208;entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost catalysts.

         <title>Against the Wallach's Rule Through Rational Design of Metal&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites Toward Efficient Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the cyclohexanediammonium cations to construct the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites, thereby challenging the Wallach's rule. Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence is achieved by strategically weakening the interactions between adjacent chiral cations. The obtained chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite demonstrates an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 71.22% together with |glum| of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The potential applications of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials in chiroptical devices have attracted considerable interest. Nevertheless, the design of efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescent pure organic materials remains a significant challenge, largely due to the limitations imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law and Wallach's rule. In this study, the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite strategy is employed to overcome these restrictions. The introduction of cyclohexylenediammonium cations as the A&#8208;site of chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites results in the generation of an efficient near&#8208;infrared/red phosphorescence at 637&#160;nm with a lifetime of up to 227.98 &#181;s. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can reach up to 71.22%, accompanied by an anisotropy factor of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The figure of merit (FM&#160;=&#160;PLQY&#215; |glum|) is 6.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is the highest value achieved among all the pure organic circularly polarized phosphorescent materials. The work proposes a unique strategy to achieve highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence based on non&#8208;conjugated luminophores, which is accomplished by combining the superior optical and electronic properties of metal&#8208;free perovskites with chirality based on the rational molecular design.

         <title>Using Colour to Control Conformation in a Chemical System Containing Multiple Tricyanofuran Photoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colour vision relies on selective, reversible isomerisation by visible light of a mixture of retinyl chromophores in photoreceptor cells. Synthetic molecular mimics of this wavelength&#8208;dependent induction of function are rare, despite the attractiveness of controlling chemical processes solely by the wavelength of incident light. Here, we report a colour&#8208;responsive chemical system composed of a cationic receptor complex, two competing chiral anionic ligands and two metastable photoacids with contrasting absorption properties. Tricyanofuran photoacids were synthesised with absorption maxima of varying wavelengths across the whole visible spectrum. Protons released by the photoacids upon selective&#160;irradiation reversibly mask the more basic receptor&#8208;bound ligand, leading to ligand exchange that can be observed as a shift in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the reporter complex. A ~90 nm separation between the absorbance maxima of the photoacids allowed each to be selectively photoisomerised in the presence of the other. The concentration of released protons, and hence the magnitude of the shift in CD response, were controlled by changing the wavelength of the incident visible light. Different output behaviours (OR/AND logic gates and wavelength detection) were programmed into the system by varying the relative proportions of the photoacids.</dc:description>

         <title>Leaflet&#8208;specific Structure and Dynamics of Solid and Polymer Supported Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;supported or tethered lipid bilayers serve as versatile platforms for mimicking plasma membrane structure and dynamics, yet the impact of polymer supports on lipid bilayers remains largely unresolved. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that combines graphene&#8208;induced energy transfer (GIET) with line&#8208;scan fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (lsFLCS) to examine the structural and dynamic properties of lipid bilayers. Our findings reveal that polymer supports markedly influence both the structural parameters, such as the membrane height from the substrate, its thickness, as well as dynamic properties, including leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion coefficients and interleaflet coupling. These findings highlight the complex interplay between a polymer support and the lipid bilayers. By resolving leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion and heights of the two leaflets from the substrate, this study emphasizes the potential of GIET&#8208;lsFLCS for probing membrane dynamics and structure. These insights significantly advance the understanding and application of polymer&#8208;supported membranes across diverse research contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conditional Activation of Protein Therapeutics by Templated Removal of Peptide Nucleic Acid Masking Groups</title>

         <dc:description>Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2)&#8208;based therapeutics are emerging as treatments for immunotherapy; however, systemic activation of immune cells hampers their success. Chemically controlling the activity of potent cytokines could mitigate unwanted T cell stimulation and widen their therapeutic window. In this study, we developed a strategy for the conditional activation of proteins utilizing removable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) masking groups. Site&#8208;specific installation of &#8220;Lock&#8221;&#8208;PNAs containing a cleavage thioester linkage enabled steric blockage of receptor binding sites. Rapid unmasking and activation were performed by the addition of a complementary &#8220;Key&#8221;&#8208;PNA containing a cysteine (Cys) residue, which forms a PNA&#8208;PNA duplex leading to a proximity&#8208;accelerated cleavage step and release of the active protein. We exemplified the versatility of this methodology on de novo cytokine neoleukin&#8208;2/15 (Neo&#8208;2/15) through the preparation of PNA conjugates including homo&#8208;dimers, PNA&#8208;stapled conjugates and dual PNA&#8208;bridged dimers. All constructs were effectively unmasked at low micromolar concentrations. Further, we demonstrated the conditional activation of a masked conjugate of Neo&#8208;2/15 in binding studies to the IL&#8208;2 receptors and in an ex vivo T cell signaling assay displaying a 480&#8208;fold potency increase upon activation.

         <title>Fluorescence of Helical Molecular Springs under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the unique structure of helicenes resembles molecular springs, the effects of their extension&#8211;contraction cycles on their properties have rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the fluorescence of two &#960;&#8208;extended [n]helicenes with different helical lengths n, named [7] and [9], under high pressures in a diamond anvil cell. The experimental results showed that compound [9], with a longer helical length, exhibited a more sensitive fluorescence response than [7] in both crystalline and solvated states upon compression. Theoretical calculations reveal that &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping at their helices in these molecular springs provides an additional contribution to their fluorescence properties under compression when the overlap becomes sufficiently strong. Our results provide insights into structure&#8208;property relationships of helical molecules under high&#8208;pressure conditions and verify the potential of helicenes as molecular springs for future applications in molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiazolium&#8208;Linked Crystalline Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks for Mixed Electronic&#8208;Ionic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs) were synthesized by a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach with well crystallinity, and high chemical stability, where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. Ionic thiazolium linkage endow these MEICOFs with recorded electronic (55.2 S m&#8722;1) and well ionic conductivity, thereby enabling ORR catalysis without additional conductive agent and the rotation of electrode.








Abstract
Developing efficiently mixed electronic&#8208;ionic (MEI) conductive microcosmic pathways within a single functional material is essential yet challenging for electronic devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) feature pre&#8208;designed functionalities and uniform pores, making them highly desirable platforms for transporting electrons and ions. However, for MEI conductive COFs, achieving high crystallinity when incorporating high&#8208;density ionic groups within the extensively &#960;&#8208;electron delocalized skeletons remain a challenge due to intermolecular interactions. Herein, we reported a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach to synthesize new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs, M&#9552;Cu, Co, Fe), where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. MEICOFs demonstrated broad ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared absorption bands and narrow bandgaps. As a proof of concept, the mixed electronic and hydroxide ionic conductivity of CuEICOF was determined to be 55.2 and 0.01 S m&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, MEICOFs film could directly catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction without additional conductive agent and the rotation of the electrode.

Moreover, MEICOFs film could directly catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction without additional conductive agent and the rotation of the electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Screening of Siloxane Molecules as Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol is proposed for screening potential electrolyte additives from a number of siloxane molecules for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, greatly improves the high&#8208;temperature performance due to its preferential binding with anions, high reactivity with H2O/HF, and good interface stabilization.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage but face significant challenges at extreme temperatures. Especially at high temperatures, side reactions and electrode dissolution are exacerbated by repeated cycling. It is, therefore, essential to optimize the electrolyte formulation. Here, a series of siloxane molecules are screened to boost the high&#8208;temperature performance of the anode materials in SIBs. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, prefers to interact with anions due to the unique electron&#8208;donating of Si&#8594;CH3. This association then weakens the P&#9472;F bond and facilitates the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. Additionally, MDM inhibits the hydrolysis of PF6&#8722;, reducing the deleterious species in the electrolyte. Therefore, commercial Sn microparticles show a reversible capacity of 752 mAh g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C after 750 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, much better than the case without MDM. This result exceeds the reported data at high temperatures. MDM as an electrolyte additive also improves the high&#8208;temperature performance of Bi and hard carbon. The results provide useful guidance for the rational selection of electrolyte additives for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regulating the Dynamics of Interpenetrated Porous Frameworks for Inverse C2H6/C2H4 Separation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable porous crystal has demonstrated an unprecedented ability for inverse separation of C2H6/C2H4 at 328&#160;K, as the shifting degree of the H&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks, which determines the width of the narrow neck, can be finely regulated under the gas stimulus across a broad and elevated temperature range.








Abstract
Selective adsorption of ethane (C2H6) from mixtures containing ethylene (C2H4) is of interest for the direct production of high purity C2H4. However, the extremely similar molecular properties of these gases make this process challenging, particularly at elevated temperatures, an implication of saved energy consumption. To address such challenge, we present a new approach for regulating the temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics in hydrogen&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks. As a single H&#8208;bond linked interpenetrated porous framework, NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 exhibits emerging structural dynamics in response to C2H6 (37&#160;kPa) and C2H4 (53&#160;kPa) and has shown a record ability to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (15.7&#160;mL g&#8722;1) at 328&#160;K, as the shifting of the interpenetrated frameworks here requires a relatively weak stimulus, allowing the optimization of adsorption at a higher temperatures range. Meanwhile, the robust and conveniently prepared NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 shows good cyclic separation performance. In comparison, the framework response of the percussor NTU&#8208;101, connected by three H&#8208;bonds, occurs at 293&#160;K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2&#160;mL g&#8722;1). This work showcases the first adsorbent for direct C2H4 purification at elevated temperatures, and the insights into the hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks will pave the way for designing soft families capable of challenging separations with reduced energy requirements.

         <title>A Key Fragment in Carbon Schwarzite Unit Cells and Its Triple [6]Helicene Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores two structurally related &#960;&#8208;skeletons. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of compounds 1a&#8211;e containing three heptagons represents a key fragment in theoretical carbon schwarzites, while that of 2a&#8211;b is a triple [6]helicene. Compounds 1a&#8211;e were synthesized via Scholl reactions, and using a weaker acid allowed the reaction to stop at an intermediate stage, yielding 2a&#8211;b. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed not only distinct stereochemistry of 1b and 2a but also unique supramolecular assemblies in the clathrate of 2a with chloroform. Compound 1b adopts a saddle&#8208;like geometry, while 2a exhibits a propeller&#8208;like structure with C3 symmetry, consistent with DFT calculations. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of 1a&#8211;e is flexible, enabling rapid enantiomerization, whereas that of 2a&#8211;b is rigid, allowing resolution of 2b into optically pure forms with an absorption dissymmetry factor as high as 0.015. Comparative analysis shows that introducing seven&#8208;membered rings in 1a&#8211;e does not significantly alter the local aromaticity of the triple [6]helicene framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Ethylene Dimerization Over Well&#8208;Defined Nickel&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization, which also offers valuable insights into bridging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is a crucial chemical process, which currently relies on organo&#8208;metallic catalysis with the assistance of overdosed additives as cocatalysts. Heterogeneous nickel catalysts have been investigated as alternatives for ethylene dimerization, however suffer from low catalytic activity and/or poor 1&#8208;butene selectivity. Herein, we report a simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization. Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y shows unprecedent performance with 1&#8208;butene formation rate of 3.8 &#215; 105&#160;h&#8722;1 and 1&#8208;butene selectivity of 91.2&#160;%, without the assistance of any cocatalysts. With the combination of advanced characterization techniques and comprehensive theoretical simulations, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the in&#8208;situ generated Ni&#8208;alkyl motif is the intrinsic active site and ethylene dimerization proceeds dominantly via the Cossee&#8208;Arlman pathway. The dynamic hydrogen transfer between ethylene/alkyl ligand and zeolite framework dedicates to the observed catalytic performance.

         <title>Photoisomerization of Azobenzene&#8208;Extended Charybdotoxin for the Optical Control of Kv1.2 Potassium Channel Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click&#8208;chemistry compatible azobenzenes are synthesized and coupled on various positions at the surface of a disulfide&#8208;bridged natural peptide. Monomers and dimers are produced and linked by azobenzene. The impact of azobenzene photoswitching on the ion channel blocking potency of the peptide is evaluated and revealed that proper positioning leads to successful photomodulation.








Abstract
Natural peptides from animal venoms effectively modulate ion channel activity. While photoswitches regulate small compound pharmacology, their application to natural peptides rich in disulfide bridges and active on ion channels is novel due to larger pharmacophores. A pilot study integrating azobenzene photoswitches into charybdotoxin (ChTx), known for blocking potassium channels is initiated. Two click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;compatible azobenzene are synthesized differing in length and amide orientation (Az1 &amp; Az2). Az1 is grafted onto ChTx at various amino acid positions using L&#8208;azidohomoalanine mutation. ChTx monomers outperformed dimers, particularly with azobenzene at position 14, by exhibiting optimal photoswitching activity. In the cis configuration, Az1 altered ChTx's pharmacophore, reducing potassium channel blockage, while conversely, Az2 increased ChTx potency. This study pioneers photoswitch application to complex peptides, leveraging structure&#8208;activity relationships. Successful integration depends on precise azobenzene positioning and chemical grafting guided by SAR insights. This advancement underscores the adaptability of photoswitch technology to intricate peptide structures, offering new avenues for pharmacological modulation.

     alt="Photoisomerization of Azobenzene-Extended Charybdotoxin for the Optical Control of Kv1.2 Potassium Channel Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click-chemistry compatible azobenzenes are synthesized and coupled on various positions at the surface of a disulfide-bridged natural peptide. Monomers and dimers are produced and linked by azobenzene. The impact of azobenzene photoswitching on the ion channel blocking potency of the peptide is evaluated and revealed that proper positioning leads to successful photomodulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural peptides from animal venoms effectively modulate ion channel activity. While photoswitches regulate small compound pharmacology, their application to natural peptides rich in disulfide bridges and active on ion channels is novel due to larger pharmacophores. A pilot study integrating azobenzene photoswitches into charybdotoxin (ChTx), known for blocking potassium channels is initiated. Two click-chemistry-compatible azobenzene are synthesized differing in length and amide orientation (Az&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;amp; Az&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Az&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is grafted onto ChTx at various amino acid positions using L-azidohomoalanine mutation. ChTx monomers outperformed dimers, particularly with azobenzene at position 14, by exhibiting optimal photoswitching activity. In the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configuration, Az&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; altered ChTx's pharmacophore, reducing potassium channel blockage, while conversely, Az&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased ChTx potency. This study pioneers photoswitch application to complex peptides, leveraging structure-activity relationships. Successful integration depends on precise azobenzene positioning and chemical grafting guided by SAR insights. This advancement underscores the adaptability of photoswitch technology to intricate peptide structures, offering new avenues for pharmacological modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation Interrogates the Native Structure of Integral Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IC&#8208;FPOMP (In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Membrane Proteins) enables rapid, free&#8208;radical footprinting upon laser irradiation of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) in live cells by using TiO&#8322; nanoparticles or H2O2. IC&#8208;FP achieves broad coverage on a human glucose transporter and an enzyme (gamma glutamyl carboxylase), revealing conformational dynamics and interactions with drugs.








Abstract
Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are pivotal for cellular functions but challenging to investigate. Here, IC&#8208;FPOMP (in&#8208;cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs) is introduced, a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC&#8208;FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO2 nanoparticles or H2O2) near the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96&#8208;well plate platform, high&#8208;throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs are achieved. IC&#8208;FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter&#8208;hGLUT1 and human gamma&#8208;glutamyl carboxylase&#8208;hGGCX) are successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane may impact the transporter&#8216;s conformation differently. In&#8208;cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug&#8208;binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC&#8208;FPOMP offers insights into IMP structure&#8208;function relationships in cells and facilitates drug discovery.

         <title>Universal Albumin Drugs&#8208;Cored Spherical Nucleic Acid (ad&#8208;SNA) Platform for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step aptamer modification of FDA&#8208;approved albumin drugs, we developed a versatile albumin drugs&#8208;spherical nucleic acid (adSNA) platform with tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, high aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, diverse drug loading capabilities, and simplified preparation with reduced costs. This platform achieves precise drug delivery, shows promising tumor mild photothermal therapy, and allows single&#8208;batch synthesis for clinical translation.








Abstract
Albumin&#8208;based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA&#8208;approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy. However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor&#8208;targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications. Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs&#8208;cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, superior tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities, and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we delivered NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor&#8208;specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR&#8208;II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures. In addition, the adSNAs are straightforward to synthesize and scalable for large&#8208;scale production, offering significant potential to advance the development of clinical targeted drugs.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Formamide via an Oxidant&#8208;Free Photoinduced Radical Coupling Route over Pt&#8208;CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia was successfully achieved through an oxidant&#8208;free radical coupling route on Pt&#8208;loaded CdS, with considerable value&#8208;added hydrogen production. A series of in situ characterizations revealed that the efficient C&#9472;N coupling between &#183;CH2OH and &#183;NH2 driven by photoinduced holes achieved the synthesis of formamide and hydrogen without formaldehyde, which makes the artificial photocatalytic route more competitive.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale manufacturing of formamide is always involved with the use of carbon monoxide, hence developing a series of eco&#8208;friendly synthesis routes is of great significance. Alternative feedstock of low&#8208;cost methanol is expected to fulfill this breakthrough due to its green and renewable nature; however, the overoxidation of methanol severely inhibits the efficacious formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia through the conventional catalytic route. Herein, we report the successful development of a direct radical coupling route for converting methanol and ammonia into high&#8208;selectivity formamide and hydrogen without extra oxidants under ambient conditions. The optimized Pt&#8208;CdS photocatalysts offered an impressive formamide production rate of 1.45&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, as well as an exceptional hole selectivity reaching up to 63.5%. The oxidant&#8208;free radical mechanism of high&#8208;efficiency formamide generation as revealed by in situ characterizations (e.g., in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ transient absorption spectroscopy), stems from the photogenerated holes oxidizing the methanol to hydroxymethyl radical for subsequently direct C&#9472;N coupling with amino radical. This work demonstrates an efficient oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced radical coupling strategy with the promise of an acceptable alternative to current technologies for artificial photosynthesis formamide using clean and abundant solar energy.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Electrolysis for Recovering Transmembrane Carbon Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy was proposed to address the transmembrane CO2 loss issue in alkaline CO2 electrolysis. By utilizing anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) as the redox mediator, the system could operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion while simultaneously enabling efficient recovery of transmembrane CO2 gas.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in alkaline media presents advantages by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhancing the CO2 reduction selectivity. However, it suffers from the carbonation issue, leading to substantial carbon loss due to CO2 transmembrane transport. To tackle this issue, we here put forward a redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy. By integrating a highly reversible redox couple, this approach spatially separates the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) into two electrolyzers, thereby enabling the recovery and reuse of transmembrane CO2. Anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) was chosen as the redox mediator owing to its suitable redox potential, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high solubility, and nontransmembrane shuttling characteristics. It allowed the RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis system to operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, maintaining a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion consistently around 90%, while effectively capturing the transmembrane CO2.&#160;This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration validates the feasibility of RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis and highlights its significant potential to advance the practical application of CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Electronic Localization Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron localization strategy to effectively suppresses the interfacial side reactions by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within PS4 tetrahedron of Li6PS5Cl through atom&#8208;scale dual&#8208;substitution of yttrium and oxygen. This approach greatly enhances the interfacial stability and enables an ultrahigh cycling performance of 100% capacity retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C.








Abstract
Argyrodite&#8208;based sulfide electrolytes have received considerable attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries owing to their high ionic conductivity and good mechanical property. However, the reactivity between sulfide electrolytes and lithium anode leads to continuous interfacial reactions and dendrites growth, which severely hinders their practical applications. We propose an electron localization strategy by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within the PS4 tetrahedral structure of Li6PS5Cl through homogeneous incorporation of yttrium (Y) and oxygen (O). The introduction of Y strengthens the Madelung energy with sulfur (S) atom and induces the electronic localization of S atom, which suppresses the interaction between lithium metal and S atom of the tetrahedron. The air&#8208;stability is also enhanced due to oxygen introduction. Furthermore, the in situ formation of Li2O interphase acts as a protective barrier, synergistically mitigating the interfacial reactions between lithium metal and Li6PS5Cl. The Li symmetric cell with the modulated Li6PS5Cl electrolyte achieves stable lithium plating/stripping for over 4800&#160;h. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with LiCoO2/Li&#8208;In electrode display a remarkable long cycle performance with 100% retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C. This study presents a distinct strategy that employs the electron localization driven by modulating orbital hybridization to achieve ultrastable interface in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Spin Polarization&#8208;Boosting Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics and Exciton Dissociation in Fe Nanoparticle&#8208;Loading Graphitic Carbon Nitride Toward Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin polarization of electrons is introduced to accelerate the exciton dissociation&#160;and the spin&#8208;selective electron transfer in CN/Fe nanohybrids to enhance selective CO2 photoreduction into CO, during which the oxidized Fe2+/Fe3+ pairs on the surface of Fe nanoparticles serve as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via double exchange interaction.








Abstract
The regulation of exciton properties plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of photocatalysts, primarily due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs caused by the strong Coulomb interaction between them. In this study, we explore the spin polarization effect in nanohybrids composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, which accelerates exciton dissociation and spin&#8208;selective electron transfer, thereby improving the selective photoreduction of CO&#8322; into CO. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Fe2&#8314;/Fe3&#8314; redox pairs, embedded in the iron oxide layer on the surface of Fe nanoparticles, function as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via a double exchange interaction (Fe2&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Fe3&#8314;). This process facilitates spin&#8208;selective electron transfer from g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324; to Fe species, thereby contributing to the efficient conversion of CO&#8322;. This work provides novel insights into the design of spin&#8208;dependent photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction Integrating Selenium(II)&#8211;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Chemistry and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,5&#8208;Trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were synthesized regioselectively with high atom economy by seamlessly integrating selenium(II)&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry with CuAAC. This multicomponent reaction was applied to the successful identification of a potent Escherichia coli &#946;$\upbeta$&#8208;glucuronidase inhibitor through target&#8208;based screening. A mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide complex was synthesized and used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.








Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tools for rapidly constructing compound libraries with sufficient molecular diversity and complexity. Herein, to fully leverage a third aspect of molecular diversity enabled by the selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) reaction between alkynes and benzoselenazolones, a novel CuI&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction has been successfully developed. This reaction integrates SeNEx with CuAAC click chemistry, enabling rapid and regioselective synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high atom economy and good to excellent yields (65 examples, 50%&#8211;95%). Notably, this MCR demonstrates excellent functional group tolerance and features modular, predictable, robust, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity (air and water compatibility). Extensive mechanism studies have revealed that this reaction proceeds by a unique SeNEx&#8208;CuAAC tandem reaction pathway, distinguishing it from conventional copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reactions. Importantly, a mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide Cu1 was synthesized and confirmed to be an efficient catalyst for the SeNEx reaction. This discovery provides crucial mechanistic insights into the preferential reactivity of alkynyl groups toward SeNEx over CuAAC. Furthermore, preliminary biological activity screening identified compound 14 as a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli &#946;$\upbeta$&#8208;glucuronidase (EcGUS), with an IC50 value of 3.16 &#181;M. These findings underscore the significant potential of this MCR in synthetic chemistry, medical chemistry, and chemical biology.

         <title>A Phenazine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Photochemical CO2 Reduction with Increased Selectivity for Two&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products will contribute to sustainable carbon use. Here we report the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide, formate, and oxalate ions using a redox&#8208;active phenazine&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (Phen&#8208;COF) and its phenazine monomer. Under similar irradiation conditions, Phen&#8208;COF produced 2.9 times more CO, 11 times more formate and 13 times more oxalate compared to equimolar amounts of the monomeric phenazine, demonstrating that the COF architecture enhances catalytic performance (TOFCOF: 10&#8208;7 s&#8208;1 CO, 10&#8208;8 s&#8208;1 formate, 10&#8208;11 s&#8208;1 oxalate). Structural analysis, including X&#8208;ray diffraction and N2 porosimetry, confirmed the COF&#8217;s long&#8208;range order and porosity. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequential formate&#8208;to&#8208;oxalate pathway, with CO and formate acting as intermediates. These results demonstrate the potential of the COF architecture to improve the performance of metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;active aromatic systems such as phenazines to facilitate efficient and selective CO2 conversion under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, that features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.</dc:description>

The TEM analysis of the resulting self-assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self-assembled structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;industrial Preparation of SWCNTs&#8208;confined High&#8208;entropy Oxides as Self&#8208;supported Electrodes for Continuous Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are emerging as highly promising materials for electrochemical applications due to their exceptional electronic properties and active sites. However, the synthesis of 1D HEO with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties has been challenging, particularly on an industrial scale. Herein, we report a spatially confined oxidation (SCO) method to synthesize 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high specific surface area and stability. This method enables the large&#8208;scale production of HEO@SWCNTs, achieving quasi&#8208;industrially quantities in a single batch, and can be extended to seven&#8208;element 1D HEO. The resulting exhibit a homogeneous distribution of elements and a single&#8208;phase solid solution structure, as confirmed by STEM&#8208;EDS and XRD analysis. The Fermi level of SWCNTs is downshifted into the valence band upon HEO doping, enhancing conductivity and electrochemical activity. The HEO@SWCNTs electrode demonstrates superior flexibility and self&#8208;supported properties, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale electrochemical applications. Chronoamperometric measurements reveal excellent stability, maintaining 94% current retention after 20 h. Notably, in the electrochemical epoxidation reaction cycloolefin, the HEO@SWCNTs self&#8208;supported electrode achieves an average FE of 70.7% for epoxy&#8208;cyclohexane over 24 h. This work provides a scalable and versatile approach to the synthesis of self&#8208;supported electrodes for advanced electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Room&#8208;Temperature Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward the Multichannel Domain Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating domain structure in ferroelectrics by external stimuli presents a fascinating avenue for new&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, multichannel controlling of ferroelectric domains is still a challenge, due to the lack of knowledge on their bistability to diverse physical stimuli. Herein, we have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics, (CnH2n+1NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (n = 2&#8208;7), of which the Curie temperatures are modulated in a wide temperature range (&#916;T = 74 K) by tailoring chain length of organic spacers. Strikingly, the n = 7 member is a room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric with bistable characteristics, thus endowing the manipulation of domains via four channels (i.e., thermal, stress, light, and electric fields). Such a non&#8208;volatile memory behavior of the stress&#8208;switching domain is unprecedented in hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics. This manipulation of domains reveals unique bistability of its ferroelectric orders, which sheds light on the future advance of customizing electric&#8208;ordered materials toward the smart device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity: A Functional Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging Approach for Resolving Lysosomal pH and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence super&#8208;resolution microscopy has enabled nanoscale imaging of intracellular structures, but it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve structural imaging and quantitative functional characterization, such as pH measurement, within the same region. Here, we introduce Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR), a novel method that integrates structural and functional imaging with single&#8208;molecule precision. By loading lysosomes with two pH&#8208;dependent spontaneously blinking fluorophores of distinct colors, 2C&#8208;SMBR leverages single&#8208;molecule localization of either fluorophore to achieve nanoscale structural imaging of lysosomes, while the ratiometric analysis of blinking dynamics between the two fluorophores provides&#160;quantitative pH measurement at the single&#8208;lysosome level. This dual&#8208;color ratiometric approach at the single&#8208;molecule level enables precise quantification of lysosomal pH with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Using 2C&#8208;SMBR, we reveal that lysosomal pH is highly heterogeneous at the single&#8208;lysosome level, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting diverse pH values. Our measurements show a pH range of 4.0 to 6.0 within lysosomes, with perinuclear lysosomes averaging a pH of approximately 4.88, while peripheral lysosomes average around 5.64. Crucially, 2C&#8208;SMBR enables real&#8208;time correlation between lysosomal dynamics and pH changes, overcoming a key limitation of super&#8208;resolution imaging. This approach not only advances nanoscale organelle characterization but also provides mechanistic insights into lysosomal physiology and function.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Reactivity of Unprotected Oximes via Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Dual Copper/Organophotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oximes are widely used precursors in synthetic chemistry due to their broad availability and versatile chemical properties, in which N&#8208;O bond fragmentation represents a key reactivity mode. However, these transformations typically require the use of oxygen&#8208;protected oximes, and a general strategy to directly utilize free oximes remains challenging due to their vulnerability to side reaction pathways, rendering low tendency towards N&#8208;OH bond cleavage. Here we report a unified platform to achieve direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals, as well as other coupling partners through dual copper/organophotoredox catalysis under green light irradiation. This protocol enables concurrent activation of both N&#8208;OH and &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of free oximes to form multisubstituted pyridines with exceeding structural diversity and high functional group tolerance. In this process, the photocatalyst (Rose Bengal) also serves as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to generate radical intermediates. In the meanwhile, copper catalyst activates free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction induced N&#8208;O bond fragmentation, and controls the selectivity for intermediate trapping. The synthetic utility of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful applications in late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active compounds and rapid assembly of solvatochromic fluorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent demand for lithium resources has been advancing the development of high&#8208;efficient lithium extraction from brines. Aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, as the only one used in salt lake industry, is limited to further improve the extraction efficiency due to the low adsorption capacity. Here, we develop a high&#8208;throughput screening framework via interpretable machine learning (ML) to rapidly determine high&#8208;performance modification strategies for the aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, avoiding huge workload from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error doping experiments in view of multiple doping schemes and the unique trade&#8208;off between performance and structural stability. Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and verified the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by near 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML&#8208;accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in salt lakes.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchor Peptide&#8208;based Immobilization Strategy Promote the Applications of Pickering Emulsion System in Natural Product&#160;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pickering emulsion systems are an advanced platform for efficient fine chemical production in biphasic enzymatic catalysis, while their applications are currently limited to a few commercial enzyme classes. Herein, we designed an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy for Pickering emulsions to achieve efficient glycosylation of natural products by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Firstly, through enzyme mining, natural GTs were utilized to synthesize pharmaceutically important acacetin glucoside and galactoside. However, the best&#8208;performing enzymes, BacGT and BarGT&#8208;3, still showed low conversions for acacetin glucoside (&lt;40%) and galactoside (&lt;10%). Then, Spy chemistry was employed to cyclize these two GTs (Spy_BacGT and Spy_BarGT&#8208;3) for improved robustness, and a Pickering emulsion was formed with the free two Spy_GTs, using 20% 2&#8208;hexanone and 1% mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CM), achieving 70% and 66% conversions of acacetin glucoside and galactoside, respectively. Further immobilization of the cyclized GTs onto CM via the anchor peptide LCI (Spy_BacGT/BarGT&#8208;3_LCI@CM) further enabled the system to reach more than 90% conversions of acacetin glycosides, retaining 90% conversions after 6&#8208;8 cycles. Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient non&#8208;selective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.</dc:description>

Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient non-selective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Control of Chiral Phases for Higher Performance and Inverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral luminescent materials have garnered increasing attention for their exceptional ability to emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) along with their excellent applications. Here, a cyclohexylidene scaffold was conceptualized as a chiral source for developing higher performance CPL materials in term of simultaneously enhanced quantum yields (PLQYs) and dissymmetry factor. It was found that the axially chiral scaffold attached with a cyanostilbene showed a pathway dependent assembly route to form chiral luminescent liquid crystals and crystal upon fast and slow cooling, respectively. A significant enhancement of PLQYs (98.4%) and a dissymmetry factor (glum) value (2.1&#215;10&#8208;2), and consequently, high Figure of Merit (FM) of up to 0.02 was achieved in chiral liquid crystal phase. Moreover, the liquid crystal and crystal phases showed the opposite CPL signals while maintained the same CD signs. Through a thorough evaluation of UV absorption, CPL emission, WAXD and theoretical calculations, it was revealed that the reversal of CPL sign was linked to distinct phases of excited state molecular packing. This research utilized a novel intrinsically axially chiral source to develop a pathway dependent and higher performance CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Linear Scaling Relation Limitations on a Dual&#8208;driven Single&#8208;atom Copper/Tungsten Oxide Catalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;, NO3RR) on single&#8208;atom copper catalysts (Cu&#8208;SACs) offers a sustainable approach to ammonia (NH3) synthesis using NO3&#8208; pollutants as feedstocks. Nevertheless, this process suffers from inferior NO3RR kinetics and nitrite accumulation owing to the linear scaling relation limitations for SACs. To break these limitations, a single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;bearing tungsten oxide catalyst (Cu1/WO3) was developed, which mediated a unique dual&#8208;driven NO3RR process. Specifically, WO3 dissociated water molecules and supplied the Cu1 site with ample protons, while the Cu1 site in an electron&#8208;deficient state converted NO3&#8208; to NH3 efficiently. The Cu1/WO3 delivered an impressive NH3 production rate of 1274.4 mgN h&#8208;1 gCu&#8208;1, a NH3 selectivity of 99.2%, and a Faradaic efficiency of 93.7% at &#8208;0.60 V, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, an integrated continuous&#8208;flow system consisting of NO3RR cell and vacuum&#8208;driven membrane separator was developed for NH3 synthesis from nitrate&#8208;contaminated water. Fed with the Yangtze River water containing ~22.5 mg L&#8208;1 of NO3&#8208;&#8208;N, this system realized an NH3 production rate of 325.9 mgN h&#8208;1 gCu&#8208;1 and a collection efficiency of 98.3% at energy consumption of 17.11 kwh gN&#8208;1. This study provides a new dual&#8208;driven concept for catalyst design and establishes a foundation for sustainable NH3 synthesis from waste.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organocatalyzed direct and asymmetric functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond via a cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). The rational design of novel NHCs guided by initial evaluation of available catalysts and their application promote the asymmetric transformation. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of benzyl radical and ketyl radical intermediates, and rationalize the coupling of these radical species via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step. This redox neutral protocol features mild conditions, and free of transition&#8208;metals and pre&#8208;functionalized radical precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Efficiency Limit in CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction and Method to Advance Towards</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrified synthesis of high&#8208;demand feedstocks (C2H4) from CO and H2O through a CO electroreduction (COR) protocol is attractive for large&#8208;scale applications; however, a high reaction potential and modest Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) limit its practical energy efficiency (EE). In this study, a quantitative reaction&#8211;transport model was constructed to analyze the root causes of low performance in COR, which revealed that the low volumetric exchange current density and limited intermediate surface reaction as key factors constraining the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ and CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion energetics and selectivities. Consequently, a robust, high active&#8208;site density electrode featuring nanometer&#8208;scale interspacing between the active, Nafion&#8482;&#8208;wrapped Cu+&#8211;Cu nanosheet catalysts was designed. This design increases volumetric COR activity with an efficient intermediate surface reaction mechanism for C2H4 production, substantially lowering the full&#8208;cell COR potential to 1.87 V at 4 A in a 25 cm2 membrane electrode assembly, thereby achieving a record &gt;50% C2+ EE with a 90&#177;1% FE along with a &gt;40% C2H4 EE with a 71&#177;1% FE throughout stable &gt;100 h operation. Similarly designed high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;activity Bi and Ag nanosheet catalysts enabled &gt;60% and &gt;55% EEs for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction, demonstrating the broader applicability of our electrochemical activity and EE enhancement concept on a three&#8208;phase interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes: Inorganic Cyclohexane&#8208;like Connectors with Stereochemically Tunable Exit Vectors for Molecular and Macromolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust organic molecules that place functional groups at well&#8208;defined angular and radial separations are valued as connectors in synthetic chemistry. Examples include rigid, polyvalent arenes and bicyclic compounds featuring strong C&#8208;C or C&#8208;H bonds. Non&#8208;aromatic rings like cyclohexane are rare in this context due to the challenge of stereochemical control over C&#8208;H functionalization. Here we investigate inorganic cyclohexane&#8208;like P2N4 rings (aza&#8208;diphosphinanes) and develop a model based on negative hyperconjugation and diaxial strain to explain their cis/trans isomerization patterns. Informed by this model, we rationally make cis&#8208;1,4 or trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted aza&#8208;diphosphinanes, and stereoselectively oxidize them to aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes which retain their cis (77&#176;) or trans (180&#176;) covalent exit vectors. These compounds show high stability but nevertheless react smoothly as 1,4&#8208;dinucleophiles, supporting their classification as new cyclohexane&#8208;like connectors. Use of the appropriate connector in polycondensations enables the preferential synthesis of low molecular weight macrocyclic oligomers (from the cis variant) or the first example of high molecular weight cyclo&#8208;linear polyphosphazenes (from the trans variant). These results provide fundamental insight into the stereochemistry of inorganic heterocycles and the consequences of molecular dimensionality, debut connectors that fill a niche left by organic ones, and offer access to new classes of inorganic polymers for future investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Robust Supraparticles for Spatially Orthogonal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroscopically sized supraparticles (SPs) are emerging as cutting&#8208;edge materials for industrial applications because of their unique properties unachievable for their nano&#8208;building blocks, but their effective methods are lacking. Here, we develop a conceptually novel strategy to assemble binary or ternary nanoparticles (NPs) within compartments of droplets through electrostatic interactions, making it possible to facilely fabricate millimeter&#8208;sized multicomponent ionic supraparticles (ISPs). The assembled ISPs possess unexpectedly high mechanical strength (50 N per bead), being amenable to practical applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Macroscopically sized supraparticles (SPs) are emerging as cutting-edge materials for industrial applications because of their unique properties unachievable for their nano-building blocks, but their effective methods are lacking. Here, we develop a conceptually novel strategy to assemble binary or ternary nanoparticles (NPs) within compartments of droplets through electrostatic interactions, making it possible to facilely fabricate millimeter-sized multicomponent ionic supraparticles (ISPs). The assembled ISPs possess unexpectedly high mechanical strength (50 N per bead), being amenable to practical applications.

         <title>Bulk measurement of membrane permeability for random cyclic peptides in living cells to guide drug development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are attractive for drug discovery due to their excellent binding properties and the potential to cross cell membranes. However, by far not all cyclic peptides are cell permeable, and measuring or predicting their membrane permeability is not trivial. In this work, we assessed the membrane permeability of thioether&#8208;cyclized peptides, a widely used format in drug discovery. We developed a strategy for synthesizing hundreds of cyclic peptides carrying a short chloroalkane tag for the bulk quantification of membrane permeability in live cells using the chloroalkane penetration assay. Permeability data for random cyclic peptides established design rules, namely that the probability of peptides entering cells is strongly increasing if the molecular weight is below 800 Da, the polar surface is smaller than 250 &#197;2, or if there are less than six H&#8208;bond donors. From this, machine learning could predict the membrane permeability of random peptides with good confidence, facilitating the future development of membrane permeable cyclic peptide drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Organic Semiconductor Thin Films Realized via Thermal Precursor Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic semiconductors are regarded as an important class of functional materials enabling their fabrication via a solution&#8208;processed method. However, supramolecularly designed organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) devices using hydrogen bonds have not been sufficiently developed. This is because of the reduced solubility caused by introducing hydrogen bond sites and the difficulty in controlling molecular orientations and packing structures. Herein, we report a reasonable strategy for the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded semiconductor thin films of a tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with amide groups using the thermal precursor approach. The thin films are successfully fabricated by thermal conversion of the corresponding precursor in the film state. Assembly structure with a hydrogen&#8208;bond network is revealed by the combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared p&#8208;polarized multiple&#8208;angle incidence resolution spectrometry. The OTFT devices exhibit high hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 among hydrogen&#8208;bonded OTFTs reported previously. Notably, we unveiled the high thermal stability of semiconductor films without decreasing device performance in air up to 250 &#176;C. This strategy can become a key methodology to form hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed organic electronic devices, namely supramolecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks in Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs) are a unique class of crystalline porous materials interconnected by covalent bonds, which have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their chemical and structural diversity, as well as their applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, research on the electrical properties of 2DCOFs remains limited, despite their potential in organic electronics. Early studies recognized the poor electrical conductivity of 2DCOFs as a significant obstacle to their application in this field. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been proposed to enhance conductivity. This review first introduces the concept of computational screening for 2DCOFs and explores approaches to improving their intrinsic conductivity, with a focus on four key aspects: in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport, topology, bandgap, and morphology. It then examines the application of pristine 2DCOFs in organic electronics, including applications in field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, photodetectors, and chemiresistive gas sensors. We support these strategies with detailed statistical data, providing a comprehensive guide for the design and development of novel 2DCOFs for organic electronics. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the challenges that remain to be addressed in this emerging area.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Binary Droplets&#8208;based Protocell Networks Driven by Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the emergence of prototissues promotes the evolutionary transformations of protolife, tissue&#8208;like networks derived from cytomimetic systems have been studied by using artificial cells as building blocks to mimic prototissues at a higher&#8208;organizational level. However, liquid&#8208;like networks originating from liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), especially heterogeneous LLPS, are less reported. Herein we report a binary liquid droplet&#8208;based protocell network composed of coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) droplets arranged in an alternating sequence, integrating both associative and segregative LLPS. This network with worm&#8208;like chains can be specifically achieved only when the attached droplets are partially engulfed, mediated by the interfacial tension between coacervate and ATPS droplets. Notably, the interconnected droplets within the network are capable of spatially self&#8208;sorting of biomacromolecules into separate domains, thereby facilitating biomacromolecular extraction and biological reactions within designated droplets. Upon changes in the external environment, the network can be reconfigured to enable morphological regulation of tri&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions. Overall, this work highlights that an all&#8208;aqueous network, coupling of associative and segregative LLPS, can be engineered as a possible route towards a hybrid prototissue&#8208;like system, offering new insights into the design of higher&#8208;order biomimetic systems utilizing liquid soft matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halogen&#8208;Doped PbSnS2 with Optimized Thermoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we investigate PbSnS2, a wide band gap (1.13 eV) compound, as a promising thermoelectric material for power generation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals its two&#8208;dimensional layered structure, akin to the GeSe structure type, with Pb and Sn atoms sharing the same crystallographic site. The polycrystalline PbSnS2 exhibits an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.37 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 573 K. However, the low carrier concentration (n) leads to suboptimal electrical conductivity (&#963;), capping the ZT value at 0.1. Accordingly, the halogen elements (Cl, Br, and I) are employed as the n&#8208;type dopants to improve the n. The DFT results indicate a significant weakening of Pb/Sn&#8208;S bonds upon halogen doping, contributing to the observed reduction in &#954;lat. Our analysis indicates the activation of multi&#8208;conduction band transport driven by halogen substitution. The PbSnS1.96Br0.04 has a high power factor of five times that of intrinsic PbSnS2.&#160;Halogen&#8208;doping weaken the Pb/Sn&#8208;S bondsand enhanced the phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow &#954;lat of 0.29 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at&#160;873 K for&#160;PbSnS1.96Br0.04. Consequently, PbSnS1.96Br0.04 achieved a maximum ZT value of 0.82 at 873 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Masking of Active Sites in Zinc Metal via Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Highly Reversible Ah&#8208;level Zinc&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal anodes suffer from severe dendrite formation and corrosion due to active Zn sites. Here, we introduce an ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane that selectively masks active Zn sites with electrochemically inactive copper through a galvanic replacement reaction (Zn0 + Cu2+ = Cu0 + Zn2+). Copper is deliberately chosen for its higher redox potential (Cu2+/Cu0; +0.34 V vs. SHE), which effectively inhibits both the corrosion reaction (H+/H2; 0 V vs. SHE) and dendrite formation (Zn2+/Zn0; &#8208;0.76 V vs. SHE). In this way, CP layer masks protrusions and grain boundaries on the zinc anode surface with inactive copper, blocking corrosion and dendritic growth, while its hydrophobic top layer reduces water activity at the interface. Benefiting from the deactivated anode surface, the resulting CP/Zn anode demonstrates exceptional stability, sustaining over 11,000 plating/stripping cycles at 10&#8239;mA&#8239;cm&#8208;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Moreover, a CP/Zn||I2 full cell with an N/P ratio of 1.85 achieves an energy density of 187&#8239;Wh&#8239;kg&#8211;1electrodes, while a 1.2&#8208;Ah pouch cell validates its practical feasibility. Our work highlights the importance of designing suitable surface chemistry to protect the Zn metal anode and indicates promising applications in other metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is promoted by an engineered variant of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA), giving rise to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent enantiopurity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.

         <title>Trade&#8208;Off Between Toxicity and Efficiency in Tin&#8208; versus Lead&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are considered promising alternatives to overcome the toxicity in their Pb&#8208;based counterparts. However, it was found that there is a trade&#8208;off between toxicity and efficiency. Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are intrinsically limited by much stronger nonradiative recombination. Future research should go beyond the Pb and Sn bases.







Abstract
Toxicity remains one of the major challenges that prevent Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites from widespread utilization. Ideally, non&#8208;toxic alternatives can be identified while still maintaining the superior power conversion efficiency of the Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using the currently most promising candidate, the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites, as an example, we show that a trade&#8208;off exists between toxicity and efficiency in the Sn&#8208; versus Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites. Indeed, the dominant nonradiative recombination center in the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites differs from the one in its Pb&#8208;based counterparts, resulting in the nonradiative capture coefficient in CsSnI3 being an order of magnitude higher than that in CsPbI3. We attribute this difference to the band alignment. Our results indicate that development of halide perovskites beyond the Pb and Sn bases is essential for efficient yet environmentally friendly perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of four highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing different glycoforms has been achieved via an efficient chemoenzymatic approach, relying on the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that sialylated glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enzymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The higher permeability of positively charged water channels Ch+ arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H&#8208;bond interactions of NH3+ groups with water compared to COO&#8722; groups in negatively charged channels Ch&#8722;, and K+ ions around COO&#8722; slowing water rotation more than Cl&#8722; ions around NH3+.







Abstract
The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8722;). The higher permeability of Ch+ channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+ and Ch&#8722; channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8722; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8722;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8722; group in Ch&#8722; channels. K+ ions concentrated around the COO&#8722; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8722; ions around the NH3+ groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H-bond interactions of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups with water compared to COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups in negatively charged channels &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions around COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; slowing water rotation more than Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions around NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (&lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (&lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). The higher permeability of &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; channels: the direct interactions of the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) around these charged groups. NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups in &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels exert less stable H-bond interaction with water than the COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group in &lt;b&gt;Ch&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; channels. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions concentrated around the COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions around the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high-performance AWCs at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8211;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), distinguished by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently introduced as an adaptable electron&#8208;withdrawing motif to construct interlayer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The unique conformational and electronic structure of BSI imparts excellent thickness tolerance and universal applicability to the interlayer materials, leading to 19.80&#8201;% efficiency OSCs with good operational stability.







Abstract
Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08&#8201;% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84&#8201;% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100&#8197;hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94&#8201;% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90&#8197;nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80&#8201;% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trimming&#8208;&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino&#8208;metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.







Abstract
Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&#8722;2 to 1.3&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built&#8208;in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity&#8208;dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH3 and NO2 using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy is applied to create NMP&#8208;SACs consisting of Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC) for exceptional HER activity. As an H&#8208;pump, Con supply hydrogen for Pt1 sites through accelerated water dissociation, enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.







Abstract
Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Heteroaryl Ketones by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbonylation of Alkenes and N&#8208;Alkenyl Heteroarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones by nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of N&#8208;alkenyl arenes and alkenes is reported. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones serve as important substructures in life science and precursors for the synthesis of diverse value&#8208;added targets in organic and biochemistry. However, direct access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones from simple and readily available starting materials remains a formidable challenge.

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl ketones by nickel-catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl arenes and alkenes is reported.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantioenriched &#945;-aminoketones serve as important substructures in life science and precursors for the synthesis of diverse value-added targets in organic and biochemistry. However, direct access to enantioenriched &#945;-aminoketones from simple and readily available starting materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an unprecedented nickel-catalyzed asymmetric cross-coupling protocol for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl ketones from alkenes and enamines in the presence of a carbon monoxide surrogate. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio- and enantioselectivity. This reductive-oxidative carbonylation of enamines and unactivated alkenes featuring the use of a carbon monoxide surrogate allows for the gas-free streamlined assembly of enantioenriched &#945;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl ketones from two distinct alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four&#8208;Petal Flower&#8208;Like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods with a g&#8208;factor of 0.026 at 724 nm have been fabricated, which endow the strong SERS signal due to the chiral selective enhancement of localized electromagnetic fields. Thus, an ultrasensitive detection method for the early clinical detection of AD is presented.








Abstract
Here, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods by using l/d&#8208;cysteine&#8211;threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands. These had a distinct spiral four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating &#8220;hot spots&#8221; that produced a potent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly twofold stronger SERS response to A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils than the d&#8208;Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the A&#946;42/A&#946;40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a cut&#8208;off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.

         <title>Compensating K Ions Through an Organic Salt in Electrolytes for Practical K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KSCN, with a low decomposition potential and high solubility in electrolytes, undergoes an oxidative reaction at 3.6&#160;V during the initial charging, releasing active K&#8208;ion and an electrolyte cosolvent (SCN)2. This electrolyte&#8208;based K&#8208;ion compensation approach is compatible with the entire battery system, allowing seamlessly integration into existing battery technologies.








Abstract
K&#8208;ion batteries face significant challenges due to a severe shortage of active K ions, with cathode materials typically containing less than 70%&#160;K ions and first&#8208;cycle irreversible reactions consuming up to 20% more. Conventional K&#8208;ion compensation methods fail to supply sufficient K ions without compromising cell integrity. To address this, we introduce potassium sulfocyanate (KSCN) as an electrolyte additive capable of delivering up to 100% active K ions. During initial charging, KSCN undergoes oxidative decomposition at 3.6&#160;V, releasing active K ions and forming the cosolvent thiocyanogen ((SCN)2). This molecule, meeting diverse electrochemical properties, was identified using unsupervised machine learning and cheminformatics. The approach demonstrated full KSCN conversion and excellent compatibility with all cell components. The presence of (SCN)2 cosolvent enhanced the rate capability of anodes by promoting K&#8208;ion desolvation. In a hard carbon|K0.5Mg0.15[Mn0.8Mg0.05]O2 pouch cell, this approach tripled the capacity through supplying 58% active K ions, showcasing a practical solution for active K&#8208;ion compensation in K&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Concurrent Folding and Fluorescent Functionalization of Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles via Heterogeneous Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled folding of synthetic polymers, mimicking the complex behaviors of biomacromolecules, offers the potential to create sophisticated nanostructures with diverse functionalities. Of great significance is the integration of functionalization directly with chain folding, especially through the incorporation of artificial elements not found in nature, which allows unprecedented flexibility in materials design. However, this approach faces significant synthetic challenge, owing to the intricate integration of multiple chemical processes within a single chain. Here, we present a heterogeneous photochemistry strategy to achieve single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization, inspired by the stepwise folding mechanism of green fluorescent protein. This method involves pre&#8208;folding amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers in water, which facilitates heterogeneous aggregation into distinct domains within single&#8208;particle nanostructures, including closely aggregated and molecularly dispersed regions. By employing spatial organization&#8208;dependent photochemical reactivity of cyanostilbene moieties, we enable two concurrent processes: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorescent dyes via intrachain excitation energy transfer allows for the modulation of emission properties, extending from green to red, and even including white light, making them promising candidates for bioimaging and related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNP&#8208;Supported Solid&#8208;State NMR Approach to Study Nucleic Acids in situ Reveals Berberine&#8208;Stabilized Hoogsteen Structures in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are central to cellular bioenergetics, with the unique ability to translate and transcribe a subset of their own proteome. Given the critical importance of energy production, mitochondria seem to utilize higher&#8208;order nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression, much like nuclei. Herein, we introduce a tailored approach to probe the formation of such structures, specifically G&#8208;quadruplexes, within intact mitochondria using sensitivity&#8208;enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization&#8208;supported solid&#8208;state NMR (DNP&#8208;ssNMR). We acquired NMR spectra on isolated intact isotopically labeled mitochondria treated with berberine, a known high&#8208;affinity G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer. The DNP&#8208;ssNMR data revealed spectral changes in nucleic acid sugar correlations, increased signal intensity for guanosine carbons, and enhanced Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation, providing evidence of in vivo G&#8208;quadruplex formation in mitochondria. Together, our workflow enables the study of mitochondrial nucleic acid&#8208;ligand interactions at endogenous concentrations within biologically relevant environments by DNP&#8208;ssNMR, paving the way for future research into mitochondrial diseases and their potential treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Triazenylarenes Enable Vicinal Sandmeyer&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of two nucleophiles in vicinal position of arenes via Sandmeyer&#8208;type reactions is compromised by the problematic diazotization of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes. Herein, we show that vicinal substitution reactions are facilitated by the use of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. Two distinct methodologies for the synthesis of these triazenes are presented. The first approach involves the sequential conversion of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;iodoarenes into first mono&#8208; and then bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. The second procedure is based on Ru&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between diynes and a 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylalkyne. The two triazene groups in the products can be substituted sequentially by a range of nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. However, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. AIE offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterwards, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. ROMP of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Sodium Ion Conductivity in Pristine Na8SnP4 &#8211; Synthesis, Structure and Properties of the two Polymorphs LT&#8208; Na8SnP4 and HT&#8208;Na8SnP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high ionic conductivities in solid state electrolytes is crucial for the development of efficient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries. Considering future availability and sustainability, sodium materials hold promises for an alternative for lithium materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, due to the higher abundance. Here we report on a sodium phosphide ion conductor Na8SnP4 with a conductivity of 0.53 mS cm&#8208;1&#160;at room temperature&#160;as pristine material.&#160;Due to the simple tetrahedral SnP4 structure units, Na8SnP4 has potential for optimization through aliovalent substitution as successfully applied in sulfide&#8208;based materials. Na8SnP4 is easily accessible from exclusively abundant elements and forms a high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature polymorph, which further allows for a fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship. Both polymorphs are structurally characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and MAS&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Ion conductivity and activation energy for ion mobility was determined by temperature dependent impedance spectroscopy and static 23Na&#8208;NMR measurements. Both MEM analysis of scattering densities as well as structure determination by Rietveld&#8208;methods hint for ionic motion between special Na positions in the structure and that ion migration proceeds along pathways passing triangular faces of neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral voids. The specific voids filling in the disordered HT&#8208;phase is found to be a crucial parameter for ion migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry to Examine the Effects of Porosity and Catalyst&#8208;Support Interactions on CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;porphyrin nanocages (M2BiCage, M = FeCl, Co, Zn) and their host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and C70 were used to examine how molecular porosity and interactions with carbon nanomaterials affect the CO2 reduction activity of metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts. The cages were found to adsorb on carbon black to provide electrocatalytic inks with excellent accessibilities of the metal sites (~50 %) even at high metal loadings (2500 nmol cm&#8722;2), enabling good activity for reducing CO2 to CO. A complex of C70 bound inside (FeCl)2BiCage achieved high current densities for CO formation at low overpotentials (|jCO| &gt; 7 mA cm&#8208;2, &#951; = 320 mV; &gt; 13.5 mA cm&#8208;2, &#951; = 520 mV) with &#8805; 95 % Faradaic efficiency (FECO), and Co2BiCage achieved high turnover frequencies (~1300 h&#8208;1, &#951; = 520 mV) with 90 % FECO. In general, blocking the pore with C60 or C70 improved the catalytic performance of (FeCl)2BiCage and had only small effects on Co2BiCage, indicating that the good catalytic properties of the cages cannot be attributed to their internal pores. Neither enhanced electron transfer rates nor metal&#8208;fullerene interactions appear to underlie the ability of C60/C70 to improve the performance of (FeCl)2BiCage, in contrast to effects often proposed for other carbon nanosupports.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N&#8208;Formyl Glycine Using MOF&#8208;808 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glyphosate (N&#8208;phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns about cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N&#8722;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common decomposition products that typically result in GPh degradation. Nanocrystalline MOF&#8722;808 (nMOF&#8722;808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF&#8208;808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size&#8208;dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, non&#8208;toxic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pair Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis Enables Cr&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Ketones Using Hydrocarbon Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a catalytic allylation of ketones using simple hydrocarbon alkenes, enabled by a synergistic system comprising chromocene and photo&#8208;activatable ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalysts derived from a thiophosphoryl imide and N&#8208;heteroaromatics. This catalyst system generates highly nucleophilic, electron&#8208;rich allylchromium(III) species directly from unactivated alkenes, demonstrating broad applicability to various ketones, including aromatic, aliphatic, and multifunctional ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance. The modular design of the IP&#8208;HAT catalysts allows precise tuning of redox potential and HAT activity, with the enhanced reduction potential of the reduced N&#8208;heteroaromatics catalyst playing a pivotal role in efficiently regenerating the electron&#8208;rich chromocene(II) catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic, Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated and Directed Diastereoselective Oxidation of Inert C&#8722;H Bonds in Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(III)&#8208;mediated, selective oxidation of remote C&#8722;H bonds is reported. This approach relies on the generation of a destabilized carbocation that is coerced into a predetermined position through charge relocation. In&#8208;depth experiments give insight into the mechanistic intricacies of this highly diastereoselective transformation.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, the functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds has become a workhorse of synthesis. In the field of C&#8722;H bond oxygenation, most established methods hinge on single&#8208;electron reactivity, encountering challenges pertaining to regio&#8208; and/or stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a conceptually distinct strategy relying on the unique features of carbocation chemistry. Our iodine(III)&#8208;mediated method achieves the diastereoselective oxygenation of remote C&#8722;H bonds at traditionally unreactive sites and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization at steroidal frameworks as well as an unusual chirality relay.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn3Si4P11 demonstrates superior second&#8208;harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn3Si4P9.







Abstract
Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn3Si4P11 from the kindred SrIn3Si4P9, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30&#8208;fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn3Si4P9. Theoretically calculated analysis reveals that the &#960; interactions and the significant polarization anisotropy of the P&#8722;P bond are critical factors contributing to the enhancement of NLO performances. The present study uncovers the pivotal significance of P&#8722;P bond in structural design and NLO properties optimization, and delineates a clear research direction for the extensive advancement of phosphides NLO materials.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;Inspired Encapsulation and Stabilization of Gold Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage encapsulates gold nanoclusters, stabilizing them against aggregation while achieving exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation performance. This system demonstrates durability, salt tolerance, and scalability, advancing sustainable solutions for energy and water purification technologies. 








Abstract
Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are highly promising for applications in photothermal conversion due to their exceptional surface area and optical properties. However, their high surface energy often leads to aggregation, compromising stability and performance. To address this, we developed a ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage with a near&#8208;enclosed cavity to physically stabilize AuNCs. This superphane cage coordinates with Au3&#8314; ions, forming highly stable and uniform AuNCs upon reduction. The encapsulated AuNCs exhibit broad absorption (250&#8211;2500&#160;nm) and achieve remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.8% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. At low power densities (0.5&#160;W/cm2), temperatures reach 150 &#176;C, and under one&#8208;sun illumination (1&#160;kW/m2), the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation efficiency reaches 95.1%, with a water evaporation rate of 2.35&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. Even after 20 seawater desalination cycles, the system maintains a stable evaporation rate of 2.24&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating excellent salt tolerance and durability. This ferritin&#8208;inspired strategy offers a robust platform for enhancing the stability and performance of AuNCs, advancing sustainable energy and water purification technologies.

         <title>Photogeneration and Visualization of a Surface&#8208;Stabilized Dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication we report the formation of a stable, surface&#8208;supported dinitrene achieved through the photolysis of a diazide precursor on an Au(111) metal substrate. We combine high&#8208;resolution scanning probe techniques with theoretical calculations, providing the first real&#8208;space imaging of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface and exploring the associated photoreaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of ZBP1 with Covalent PROTACs for Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a covalent PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) was developed to achieve precise and efficient degradation of ZBP1 by leveraging DNA aptamer targeting and NASA&#8208;mediated covalent binding. This approach suppresses necroptosis and mitigates inflammation, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for infection&#8208;induced inflammation and diseases. The findings highlight the potential of targeted protein degradation in modulating inflammatory responses and advancing treatment options.








Abstract
Z&#8208;DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) has emerged as a critical pathogen&#8208;sensing protein that upon activation, triggers necroptotic signaling cascades, leading to a potent inflammatory response and potentially causing significant tissue damage. However, available drugs specifically developed for the effective inhibition or degradation of ZBP1 is still lacking so far. In this study, we developed a potent covalent recognition&#8208;based PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) molecule for the degradation of ZBP1. It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA&#8208;containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 ligase&#8208;recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1&#8208;PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation&#8208;inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease-associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three volatile imide additives with large dipole moments which improved the performance of the OSCs device by manipulating the crystallization process of the acceptor were reported. These additives could induce the acceptor to first nucleate and then grow, forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains and improving charge transport. One of the highest power conversion efficiencies of 19.04% was achieved for D18:L8&#8208;BO devices treated with pClPA.







Abstract
Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13&#8201;% to 18.58&#8201;%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04&#8201;% was achieved. Our results indicate using imide unit to construct solid additives is a simple and effective strategy, and the positional isomerization of halogen atom also has a large effect on the photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte was designed to break the trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity from aqueous electrolyte and the stable interface from hydrogel electrolyte, through the high ionic conductive bulk electrolyte and lean&#8208;water hydrogel&#8208;like state interface. This work paves a new way for electrolyte design towards pratical zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25&#8201;%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average coulombic efficiency (over 99.90&#8201;%). By demonstrating the remarkable performance, our work represents an advancement in zinc metal batteries toward a practical scale and is expected to set a stepping stone for transformative advancements in energy storage technologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V and a large CO partial current density of 608.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Integrated solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) disrupt the hydrogen bond network through the surface amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands, activate the interfacial water, and enrich the alkyne molecules. In addition, their unique enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets adsorb alkyne molecules through the &#963;&#8208;bonding mode, allowing the timely desorption of alkene, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% selectivity, and 85&#8201;% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work not only exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.

         <title>Engineering Solvent&#8208;coordinated Heterometallic&#8208;organic Frameworks for Wide&#8208;range Tuning of Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence towards Time&#8208;resolved Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven promising ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials for anti&#8208;counterfeit due to their unique optical properties. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve the desired phosphorescent properties due to the limited regulatory methods and indistinct mechanism. Herein, the coordination solvent and second metal ion co&#8208;strategy is firstly proposed to prepare seven robust heterometallic&#8208;organic frameworks (HMOFs) with two configurations: ZnMg/Ca&#8208;sol [sol = H2O, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and formyldiethylamine (DEF)] and ZnSr/Ba&#8208;H2O, exhibiting the different ultralong RTP. The tunable phosphorescence lifetimes within 14.5&#8208;195.4 ms are achieved gradually by altering the type of alkaline earth metals, coordination solvent, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding in the HMOFs. Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#1060;P) and long lifetime, especially for ZnSr&#8208;H2O (6.8%, 195.4 ms). Depending on the wide&#8208;range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial&#8208;time resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multi&#8208;level information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &#1060;P and long lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Asymmetric C&#8208;H Acylation of Trifluoroethanol by Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serving as a bio&#8208;isostere for methyl groups, the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) has become a key area of interest in pharmaceutical lead optimization for its unique combination of steric bulk and high electronegativity. Recognizing the widespread application of optically pure &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy carbon centers in drug molecules, the introduction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxytrifluoroethyl groups into stereogenic centers holds significant potential. Herein, we describe an asymmetric trifluoroalkylation protocol utilizing nickel/photoredox co&#8208;catalysis to synthesize enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acyloins via a 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom migration strategy. DFT calculations guided the reaction design, revealing hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the transition state that control the chiral outcome. The resulting products can be further reduced through a one&#8208;pot process to yield fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols with adjacent stereocenters. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding synergistic methodology demonstrates excellent stereochemical control, mild conditions, and broad functional group tolerance, enabling the efficient asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of complex molecules and offering new avenues for chiral drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Polarization&#8208;Induced Anisotropy Enhances Protein Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein crystallization plays a critical role in structural biology and drug development, driving extensive research into its control. We present a novel approach for manipulating protein crystallization by controlling the anisotropy of the high&#8208;concentration domain (HCD) composed of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) through laser polarization in optical trapping. The anisotropy of the HCD was assessed through fluorescence anisotropy measurements and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results revealed that linear polarization significantly enhances crystallization efficiency by inducing anisotropy of the HCD and promoting nucleation. In contrast, circular polarization resulted in weak anisotropy with minimal crystallization efficiency. This study highlights the crucial role of protein molecule anisotropy in crystallization under optical trapping conditions, providing a new strategy to optimize laser conditions for various protein molecules and pave the way for the development of innovative crystallization techniques, potentially revolutionizing structural biology and drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulating Electrophilic Electrolyte for In&#8208;Situ Stabilization of 4.8 V Li&#8208;Rich Batteries with 100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathodes are expected to overcome the energy density limitations, but their applicability is hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases with sluggish kinetics. Here we propose an elaborate electrophilic electrolyte that effectively stabilizes surface lattice oxygen of LLO cathode, facilitates the formation of dense and fast&#8208;ion&#8208;transport electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and prevents Li&#8208;dendrites on anode. The nucleophilic reaction mechanism driven by our electrolyte enables LLO to exhibit a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&#8208;1 with a record ICE of 100%, as well as impressive 3C fast&#8208;charging stability, remarkably superior to that in the basic electrolyte. Using this engineered electrolyte, our assembled 4.5 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell of graphite||LLO displays high energy density and remarkable reversibility during cycling, demonstrating wide applicability. This work provides valuable insights and pragmatic strategies in electrolyte chemical engineering for advancing high&#8208;energy density and fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catalysis System Coupled with Redox Mediator Effect for Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 batteries significantly limit their performance. To address this issue, the insulating characteristics of the discharge product Li2O2 and the reactivity of highly active superoxide species are examined. Herein, organic metal salts with weak electrolyte properties are utilized as bifunctional additives. The ionized metal ions can be reduced and doped Li2O2 through in&#8208;situ electrochemical implantation, thereby altering its insulating properties. Additionally, organic metal salts function as redox mediators (RMs), stabilizing the intermediate LiO2 and facilitating its further disproportionation to Li2O2, as well as enhancing the decomposition reaction during charging, which are further proven by the in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. Notably, Li&#8208;O2 batteries incorporating Mn(acac)3 demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.43 V and sustain 250 long cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1. Furthermore, when combined with optimized cathode, a remarkable cycle stability of 3850 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1 is achieved. These findings offer novel insights for design of advanced Li&#8208;O2 battery systems and the enhancement of their performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular chemiluminescence probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offer promising benefits in deciphering complex pathological processes in a living system, as NIR chemiluminescence minimizes autofluorescence, enhances deep&#8208;tissue penetration, and improves signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Molecular engineering with single luminophore design and dual&#8208;luminophore design with intramolecular energy transfer provides way to develop conventional chemiluminophore scaffolds into NIR chemiluminescence probes with ideal chemiluminescence quantum yield and half&#8208;life. By virtue of the structural diversity, 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based NIR chemiluminophores with biomarker activity have been developed. This review summarizes the molecular design strategies of unimolecular NIR chemiluminescent probes (UNCPs), followed by introducing activatable UNCPs with their biomedical applications for disease theranostics. Lastly, future perspectives and potential challenges of NIR chemiluminescence imaging in preclinical research and clinical translational potential are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Defect passivation is widely acknowledged as a crucial strategy for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it remains a formidable challenge to effectively address multiple defects simultaneously on both the top and bottom surfaces of perovskite films, as well as within the bulk, through a facile method. To tackle this dilemma, we have devised a triple passivation strategy, aiming to achieve a holistic passivation of defects at the aforementioned locations using a singular passivator. Specifically, a multifunctional molecule, tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TTFP), is meticulously engineered as an additive in the antisolvent. This approach capitalizes a top&#8208;down gradient distribution of TTFP along the perovskite film, thereby enabling to mitigate the interfacial and bulk defects. Meanwhile, the unique molecular structure of TTFP facilitates simultaneous interactions with both cationic and anionic defects. Additionally, TTFP exerts a pronounced influence on the crystallization kinetics, thereby promoting the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films with substantially enlarged grain sizes. Consequently, the TTFP&#8208;based devices exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.69%, accompanied by a notable improvement in stability. This work represents the successful implementation of comprehensive defect passivation, marking a significant instance in the advancement of efficient and stable PSC technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Access to P&#8208;Chiral Triarylphosphine Oxides via Insertion of P&#8722;H Bonds into Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While significant progress has been made in enantioselective insertion of carbenes into heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds, this chemistry is predominantly restricted to construction of carbon&#8208;based chirality. The asymmetric insertion of carbenes into P&#8208;H that delivers P&#8208;chiral products remains untouched. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides via asymmetric C&#8208;P coupling of a secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) with diazonaphthoquinone. Driven by aromatization, this protocol affords a variety of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides tethered to a 2&#8208;naphthol functionality in excellent enantioselectivity by following a kinetic resolution reaction pattern. The diverse synthetic and catalytic applications of the P&#8208;chiral products highlight the value of this method, even though the derivatized trivalent chiral phosphine bears a rather low barrier of racemization.</dc:description>

         <title>High Entropy Boosts the Low Temperature Na+&#8208;storage Performance of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been considered as a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the inferior electronic conductivity and inadequate Na+ ions diffusion kinetics of NFPP at low temperatures hinder its practical applications. In this study, high entropy Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE&#8208;NFPP) have been synthesized via a spry&#8208;drying and high temperature sintering technique. The incorporation of transition metals (TMs) ions into NFPP using the HE strategy facilitates electron transportation by reducing the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. Meanwhile, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in HE&#8208;NFPP can effectively improve the Na+ ions diffusion efficiency, resulting in enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. Moreover, it leads to a significantly mitigated volume expansion/contraction in HE&#8208;NFPP caused by Na+ ions extraction/insertion during (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the fabricated HE&#8208;NFPP exhibits an excellent rate and cyclic performance at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible CO2&#160;Hydrogenation, Neutron Crystallography, and Hydride Reactivity of&#160;a Triiridium Heptahydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the structure, reactivity, and catalytic utility of a triiridium complex,&#160;[Ir3H6(&#181;3&#8208;H)(PN)3]2+&#160;(2&#8208;H, PN = (2&#8208;pyridyl)CH2PBut2). Despite its unusual stability to unsaturated organics, electrophiles, and even CF3SO3D, we find that complex 2&#8208;H&#160;catalyzes hydrogenation of CO2&#160;to formate (TONIr&#160;= 9,600)&#160;and reverse formic acid dehydrogenation (TONIr&#160;= 54,400). The hydrogenation operates via a reactive intermediate [Ir3H4(&#181;&#8208;H)4(PN)3]+&#160;(5). Neutron crystallography and DFT&#8208;supported neutron vibrational spectroscopy of 2&#8208;H&#160;reveal Ir&#8211;H&#160;bond lengths and elucidate the vibration modes within&#160;the&#160;Ir3H7&#160;core. Stoichiometric oxidation of 2&#8208;H&#160;produces four classes of iridium complexes of varied nuclearity and hydride structure;&#160;tetra&#8208; and pentanuclear clusters [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;AuPPh3)(PN)3]2+&#160;(2&#8208;Au) and [Ag{Ir2H4(&#956;&#8208;OAc)(PN)2}2]3+&#160;(6) were generated using AuPPh3+&#160;and AgOAc, respectively. Further oxidation to class [Ir2H3(&#956;&#8208;X)2(PN)2]+&#160;is possible with AgOAc, Hg(OAc)2, or I2. Finally, a TEMPO/HCl system completely oxidizes the hydrides and gives [Ir2Cl4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(PN)2] (11).</dc:description>

         <title>Developing the Tandem Structure to Regulate Interfacial Chemistry and Promote Ion Transport Kinetics towards High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer and Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) are crucial for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries, especially under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we propose a delicately designed tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) to regulate the chemical stability of dual interfaces. The cyano group in CYANO&#8208;COF induces a stable CN&#8208;enriched CEI on the surface of high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode through the adsorption/coordination effect with transition metals (TMs), inhibiting irreversible phase transitions, TMs dissolution, and other side reactions. Meanwhile, a straightforward in&#8208;situ conversion is used to construct an artificial hybrid SEI layer comprising LiF and Li&#8208;Sn alloy. As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron&#8208;blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li+ to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5 V and 55 &#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Core Thermotropic Liquid Crystal with A Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with hierarchical and well&#8208;ordered structures are believed to deliver superior performance in semiconductor device applications. Despite this potential, traditional alignment techniques for GNRs often fall short in producing defect&#8208;free and precisely defined molecular architectures. Here, we introduce a strategy for the fabrication of highly&#8208;ordered GNRs by empowering them with thermotropic liquid crystallinity, utilizing a bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis approach. The resulting GNR liquid crystal (GNR&#8208;LC) molecule can self&#8208;assemble into a hexagonal columnar phase. The homeotropic alignment of GNR&#8208;LC is enabled by the intrinsic self&#8208;assembly capabilities of the thermotropic liquid crystalline state, thereby forming one&#8208;dimensional charge transport pathways. Devices incorporating GNR&#8208;LC have demonstrated significantly enhanced hole mobility, reaching up to 2.4 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, underscoring their viability as organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>La3ZrGa5O14: Band&#8208;inversion Strategy in Topology&#8208;Protected Octahedron for Large Nonlinear Response and Wide Bandgap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The contradictory relationship between band gaps and the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response constitutes a formidable challenge in the rational design of infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. In oxide&#8208;based crystals, the incorporation of strongly distorted octahedra containing d0 cations as central elements is a common approach to enhance SHG responses, while inadvertently leading to a significant decrease in band gaps due to the unfavorable energy level splitting. In this study, we introduced an innovative "4d/5s electron band&#8208;inversion" strategy to enhance SHG response while preserving a wide band gap within the octahedron&#8208;symmetry&#8208;protected langasite structure. We successfully synthesized a novel high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystal, La3ZrGa5O14 (LGZr), where the unoccupied 4d orbitals of the Zr4+ cation underwent a transition from the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, and the ZrO6 octahedra exhibited minimal distortion. Consequently, LGZr exhibited the largest SHG response observed to date (reaching up to 2.4&#215; La3Nb0.5Ga5.5O14) and the broadest band gap (5.16 eV) within the langasite family. Furthermore, LGZr was revealed with a remarkable laser damage threshold (1.66 GW/cm2) and broad IR transmission capabilities (~7.8 &#956;m), and supported the growth of centimeter&#8208;sized crystals. The "band&#8208;inversion strategy" offers significant advantages to realize high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Coupled NIR Organic Hybrid Solar Cells Achieving an 84.2% Fill Factor and a 25.2% Efficiency: A Comprehensive Mechanistic Exploration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of organic dyes in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to utilize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons remains a challenge. In this study, a selenium&#8208;incorporated ortho&#8208;benzodipyrrole&#8208;based NIR dye CB&#8208;2Se was developed. CB&#8208;2Se, featuring a lower bandgap of 1.35 eV, was blended with PCBM to form a bulk&#8208;heterojunction layer in PSCs for electron extraction and transport. Compared to Y6&#8208;16 acceptor, the removal of the Tz unit in CB&#8208;2Se suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, improving its compatibility with PCBM. A CB&#8208;2Se:PCBM&#8208;incorporated PSC achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% with a VOC of 1.164 V, a JSC of 25.71 mA/cm&#178;, a Fill Factor of 84.15%, outperforming that of the PCBM&#8208;only reference device (24.35%) and the PCBM:Y6&#8208;16&#8208;based device (24.49%). The PCBM:CB&#8208;2Se layer enhanced the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs, retaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h under ambient air and thermal conditions. The photophysical interactions between NIR dyes and PSCs have been comprehensively investigated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast exciton separation into free charges occurs within 200 femtoseconds at the interfaces between PCBM and CB&#8208;2Se. For the first time, a transfer of holes from CB&#8208;2Se back to the perovskite was detected, providing valuable insights into the charge dynamics of PSCs utilizing NIR dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Ni Single Atom and MoC Nanoclusters Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of sulfur (S) cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Addressing these challenges requires advanced catalytic host materials capable of trapping LiPSs and accelerating Li&#8208;S redox reactions. However, single&#8208;site catalysts struggle to effectively mediate the complex multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;phase sulfur conversion processes. In this study, we present a novel dual&#8208;site catalyst, featuring nickel single atoms anchored to nitrogen sites (Ni&#8208;N4) within a carbon nitride (NC) matrix and molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoclusters. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that MoC sites efficiently catalyze the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while Ni&#8208;N4&#160;sites drive the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs.&#160;When incorporated as a coating on the cathode side of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC catalyst enhances sulfur utilization, suppresses LiPSs&#160;shuttling, and facilitates a uniform Li+&#8208;ion distribution. Thereby, Li&#8208;S batteries demonstrate outstanding performance, including an initial capacity of 1624 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2C and 1142 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1C. At a sulfur loading of 8.3 mg cm&#8315;&#178; and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 &#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57 mAh cm&#8315;&#178; at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.</dc:description>
