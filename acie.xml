      <title>Photochemical Electrocyclization of Poly(phenylacetylene)s: Unwinding Helices to Elucidate their 3D&#8208;Structure in Solution</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented as a new tool for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone, where important structural information such as w1 can be obtained. This new methodology allows not only the classification of PPAs in cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt; 90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal structures (&#969;1&gt; 90&#176;), but also to obtain the approximate value of &#969;1, a crucial helical parameter. The process involves the irradiating a dilute PPA solution with visible light and monitoring the photochemical electrocyclization of the PPA helix by measuring the ECD spectra at different times. Thus, PPAs with a cis&#8208;cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50% before 30 min of irradiation, while cis&#8208;transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized to cisoidal before the photochemical electrocyclization of the helix takes place. Moreover, the different cis&#8208;cisoidal and cis&#8208;transoidal helices require different times to decrease their ECD signal by 50% (t1/2), depending on the degree of compression or stretching of the helix, a fact that allows establishing a relationship between the secondary structure adopted by the PPA (&#969;1) and the time required to lose the ECD vinylic signal by light irradiation. This process also permits the detection and identification of different helical scaffolds that can coexist in some solutions of the polymers.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of deuterium into drug molecules to study and improve their biological properties is crucial for drug discovery and development. Herein, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed room&#8208;temperature deuterogenolysis of carbon&#8208;oxygen bonds in alcohols and ketones with D  2  balloon for practical synthesis of deuterated pharmaceuticals and chemicals with benzyl&#8208;site (sp  3  C&#8208;H) D&#8208;incorporation. The highlights of this deoxygenative deuteration strategy are mild conditions, broad scope, practicability and high chemoselectivity. To enable the direct use of D  2  O, electrocatalytic D  2  O&#8208;splitting is adapted to  in&#8208;situ  supply D  2  on demand. With this system, the precise incorporation of deuterium in the metabolic position (benzyl&#8208;site) of ibuprofen is demonstrated in a sustainable and practical way with D  2  O.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Dimensional Porous Molybdenum Phosphide/Nitride Heterojunction Nanosheets for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The morphology and heterojunction engineering of Mo&#8208;based catalysts are intensively pursued for effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but it remains a challenge to achieve the two targets simultaneously. Herein, we show a new strategy toward the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8203;&#8208;  &#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets is about 20 nm thick and has plentiful pores (&lt; 5 nm). These structure features offer several advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favourable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibits excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. In particular, its HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt; 55 mA cm&#8208;2  in neutral medium and &gt;190 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline medium.

      <title>Cocrystal Engineering: toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) cocrystals open a new way to get 2D functional materials via  crystal engineering instead of molecular engineering. Here, large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with length reaching several millimeters with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been successfully designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C 60  (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystals with absorption wavelength up to 1080 nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Impressively, due to the highly ordered donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is significantly enhanced and becomes comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424 mA/W to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6 s. The excellent device performance can be attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and the optimization of device configuration. This work shows an example of controlled growth of 2D cocrystals for broadband photodetectors, which reveals the brilliant future of cocrystal films for high&#8208;performance electronics and paves their way towards large&#8208;scale, integrated, flexible, practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;range Exciton Migration in Coassemblies: Achieving High Photostability without Disrupting the Electron Donating of Fluorene Oligomers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, photostable coassemblies from a nonphotostable fluorene oligomer (the energy donor) and a photostable oligomer (the energy acceptor) are fabricated. Long&#8208;range exciton migration over a net distance of about 370 energy donor molecules to energy acceptor is demonstrated in such coassemblies. The fast and long energy migration allows for the harvesting of the excitation energy of energy donors by embedding a small number of energy acceptors for photostability enhancement. Importantly, embedding a small number of energy acceptors in coassemblies causes a negligible negative influence on the electron donating of energy donors that are desired in practical applications. The advantages of coassemblies fabricated in this concept, i.e., high photostability without disrupting the electron donating of energy donors, are well illustrated in fluorescence detection of trace explosives where prolonged working life and improved detection capacity are achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Scan and Unlock: A programmable DNA molecular automaton for cell&#8208;selective activation of ligand&#8208;based signaling</title>
      <dc:description>Selective modulation of ligand&#8208;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. Current approaches have a limited capacity to engineer a protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;selectivity to overcome its pleiotropic function and potential off&#8208;target toxicities. In this study, we aimed at designing an intelligent &#8220;Scan and Unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via the Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling. The SUDA strategy is a powerful and versatile approach for engineering a designated ligand that is capable of precise cell&#8208;identification for cell&#8208;specific signaling and cellular behaviors toward low&#8208;side&#8208;effect therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Donor/Acceptor Pair Created by Electrostatic Interaction: Design, Synthesis, and Investigation on Exciplex Formed within the Pair</title>
      <dc:description>Exciplex formed between donor and acceptor has been widely explored, but isolating it from each other and tuning of interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here we report pairs of carbazole&#8208;based anionic donor and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;based cationic acceptor, which are bound together by electrostatic interaction, and the exciplex formed in the pair. In diluted film, the  donor/acceptor (D/A) pair  affords isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, the interaction between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to conventional exciplex formed in neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescent efficiency. The D/A pairs show intriguing mechanochromic luminescence and mechanical grinding&#8208;induced/reinforced TADF in solid&#8208;state and promising performances as emitters in light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Carbon Nanoplates for Selective Separation of CH4/N2</title>
      <dc:description>There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method  for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, i.e., in 10 min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH 4  /N 2  selectivity up to 24 at a low CH 4  partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH 4  diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.</dc:description>

      <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni&#8208;based materials are the only non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but are generally suffered from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni  4  Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)  2  nanosheets. The final product exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79 A g  &#8208;1  at the overpotential of 50 mV. Superior hydrogen evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.</dc:description>

Ni  4  Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)  2  nanosheets. The final product exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79 A g  &#8208;1  at the overpotential of 50 mV. Superior hydrogen evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  ) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.</dc:description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxyl Intermediate in the Bifunctional Mechanism of Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism due to a lack of direct  in situ  evidence of the reaction intermediates. Herein,  in situ  electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study HOR processes on both PtNi alloy and pure Pt surfaces. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH  ad  ) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OH  ad  species were not observed on the surface of pure Pt during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxyl adsorption on the Pt&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxyl adsorption. Thus, we provide direct evidence of the presence of the OH  ad  intermediate species on an oxophilic metal surface during the HOR and deduce its important role in improving the HOR activity and rate. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic Peptide Synthesis and Spontaneous Amyloid Formation Inside a Proto&#8208;Cellular Compartment</title>
      <dc:description>Cellular life requires a high degree of molecular complexity and self&#8208;organization, some of which must have originated in a prebiotic context. Here, we demonstrate how both of these features can emerge in a plausibly prebiotic system. We found that chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids can lead to the formation of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibrils that are localized inside of a proto&#8208;cellular compartment. In this process, the fatty acid or lipid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8208;DNA chimeras enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA &#8211; under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776; 60%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine nucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine&#8208;deoxynucleotides (&#8776; 20%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776; 18&#8208;31%) is observed with predominantly 3',5'&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8208;DNA coevolution.</dc:description>

      <title>Identifying the Critical Anion&#8722;Cation Coordination to Regulate Electric Double Layer for Efficient Lithium Metal Anode Interface</title>
      <dc:description>The persistent efforts to reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are of fundamental significance for the rational regulation. In this work, through combined theoretical and experimental model investigations, we elucidate that the electric double layer (EDL) chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interface instead of the thermodynamic stability of electrolyte components predominately controls the competitive reduction reactions during SEI construction on Li metal anode. Specifically, the negatively&#8208;charged surface of Li metal will prompt substantial cation enrichment and anion deficiency within the EDL. Necessarily, only the species participating in the solvation shell of cations could be electrostatically accumulated in proximity of Li metal surface and thereafter be preferentially reduced during sustained dynamic cycling. Incorporating multi&#8208;valent cation additives to more effectively drag the favorable anionic SEI enablers into EDL is validated as a promising strategy to upgrade the Li protection performance. The conclusions drawn herein afford deeper understandings to bridge the EDL principle, cation solvation, and SEI formation, shedding fresh light on the targeted regulation of reactive alkali metal interfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly of the mitochondrial Complex I assembly complex suggests a regulatory role for deflavination</title>
      <dc:description>Fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are mitochondrial redox processes that generate ATP. The biogenesis of the respiratory Complex I, a 1 MDa multiprotein complex that is responsible for initiating OXPHOS, is mediated by assembly factors including the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. However, the organisation and the role of the MCIA complex are still unclear. Here we show that ECSIT functions as the bridging node of the MCIA core complex. Furthermore, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy together with biochemical and biophysical experiments reveal that the C&#8208;terminal domain of ECSIT directly binds to the vestigial dehydrogenase domain of the FAO enzyme ACAD9 and induces its deflavination, switching ACAD9 from its role in FAO to an MCIA factor. These findings provide the structural basis for the MCIA complex architecture and suggest a unique molecular mechanism for coordinating the regulation of the FAO and OXPHOS pathways to ensure an efficient energy production.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA&#8208;based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Here, we describe the remote&#160;manipulation of native (non&#8208;photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine&#8208;based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.</dc:description>

The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>
      <dc:description>Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. In this contribution, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1 s) to ozone as low as 0.1 ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1 ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the outstanding performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was in&#8208;depth unveiled by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>NH4+  ions as charge carriers show great potential in aqueous rechargeable batteries. Herein, we study for the first time the NH4+  storage chemistry in electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx  experiences morphology and phase transformation during charge/discharge in diluted ammonium acetate (NH 4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+  storage inside MnOx. The transformed MnOx  with layered structure delivers a high specific capacity of 176 mAh g&#8208;1  at the current density of 0.5 A g&#8208;1  , and exhibits good cycling stability over 10000 cycles in 0.5 M NH4Ac, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+  hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+  migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the reversible NH4+  insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by H bond formation/breaking between NH4+  and the MnOx  layers. These findings provide a new study prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contribute to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+  storage mechanism in metal oxides.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8208;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8208;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO, or CO&#8208;derived ligands, bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33 &#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged role for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Anionic borate&#8208;based bi&#8208;mesoionic carbenes based on 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes show unique C&#8722;N isomerization reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013376), Biprajit Sarkar and co&#8208;workers report on the isomerized ligands in CoII&#160;complexes. The picture shows these complexes, which, although having a similar first coordination sphere, differ in geometry, spin state and reactivity. All of these differences are caused by the control of the second coordination sphere, in which agostic interactions influence the cobalt center.

D&#8208;xylose can be transformed into a polymerizable enyne sugar&#8208;based monomer, as shown in the cover picture. Chalked in are the achieved properties of the various degradable polymers. The polymerization evolves a D&#8208;xylose&#8208;derived monomer to a full polymer chain which can be decomposed under mild acidic conditions, as explained by Tae&#8208;Lim Choi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012544). The act of drawing rough ideas on a board, a practice chemists still enjoy, and the coming to fruition of those ideas on a molecular level are represented by the 2D chalk board transition to 3D polymer.

The polymerization evolves a D&#8208;xylose&#8208;derived monomer to a full polymer chain which can be decomposed under mild acidic conditions, as explained by Tae&#8208;Lim Choi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202012544"&gt;10.1002/anie.202012544&lt;/a&gt;). The act of drawing rough ideas on a board, a practice chemists still enjoy, and the coming to fruition of those ideas on a molecular level are represented by the 2D chalk board transition to 3D polymer.

      <dc:description>
Identification of the glycotope of avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) O1 is important for the design of a new generation of improved and safer vaccines. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013729), Daisuke Takahashi, Kazunobu Toshima et&#8197;al. synthesize the unique pentasaccharide derived from virulent E. coli O1 and reveal that the pentasaccharide is a glycotope candidate of APEC O1, with great potential as an antigen for vaccine development.

      <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction (CO  2  RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals offers an efficient way to mitigate global warming and energy supply issues. However, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR to boost reaction efficiency and guide understanding of catalytic mechanism remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a NiSn atomic pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of CO  2  RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consist of adjacent Ni and Sn coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N  4  &#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N  4  ) respectively, which is confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Typically, the as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays an exceptional activity toward CO  2  RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752 h  &#8208;1  , a formate productivity of 36.7 mol h  &#8208;1  g  Sn  &#8208;1  and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9%), which are superior to the previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs). Moreover, both in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. The NiSn synergistic catalysis for CO  2  RR in this work provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic pair electrocatalysts with largely enhanced performance.</dc:description>

      <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31 with an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al = 16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;rings, which are connected by single 4&#8208;rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by 9&#8208;, 10&#8208;, and 11&#8208;rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [4  2  .5  14  .6  4  .7  2  .9  4  ] cavities composed of smaller [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of  n  &#8208;hexane to light olefins.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31 with an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al = 16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;rings, which are connected by single 4&#8208;rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by 9&#8208;, 10&#8208;, and 11&#8208;rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [4  2  .5  14  .6  4  .7  2  .9  4  ] cavities composed of smaller [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of  n  &#8208;hexane to light olefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
      <dc:description>Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine&#8208;modified asymmetric acetylacetonate&#8208;type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79% in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4 &#956;s. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5% at 100 cd/m2. This is the best performance in light metal&#8208;based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions&#160;With Biomolecules</title>
      <dc:description>Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations, EKO, strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.</dc:description>

      <title>Topological Distortion Driven Amorphous Spherical MOFs for High Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOFs microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically&#8208;shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOFs microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as ~10  4  and can provide sufficient feedback for high quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.</dc:description>

In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically&#8208;shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOFs microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as ~10  4  and can provide sufficient feedback for high quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Proposed are Prussian blue analogue hosts with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality with open Co and Fe species, which facilitate maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and free up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6] exhibits a low energy barrier (0.47&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and low Tafel slope (76.74&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Accordingly, the Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The battery delivers both high energy density and high&#8208;power density of 305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, higher than I2//Zn batteries reported to date. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state flexible batteries were constructed. A 100&#8197;mAh high capacity solid&#8208;state I2//Zn battery is demonstrated with excellent cycling performance of 81.2&#8201;% capacity retained after 400 cycles.

      <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Aluminum Organic Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage device, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al  3+  ions (de)insertion mechanism. However, the strong electrostatic forces between Al  3+  and the host materials usually lead to sluggish kinetics, poor reversibility and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox&#8208;active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large&#8208;size Al&#8208;complex co&#8208;intercalation via reversible redox active centers (&#8211;C=N&#8211;) of PZ. This co&#8208;intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs. This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.</dc:description>

This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Probing transient DNA conformation changes with an intercalative fluorescent excimer</title>
      <dc:description>Variation of DNA conformation plays important roles in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, direct probing transient DNA conformation changes remains challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of this process. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. We find that K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA and the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer strongly correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in a variety of DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotides mutation at random positions. We further analyze the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe the transient conformation changes of DNA structures, and holds great potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Because of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, lectins are considered novel drug targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes LecA and LecB in the infection process. Inhibition of both lectins with carbohydrate&#8208;derived molecules can reduce biofilm formation to restore antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we focused on non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitors for LecA to explore new avenues for lectin inhibition. From a screening cascade we obtained one experimentally confirmed hit, a catechol, belonging to the well&#8208;known PAINS compounds. Rigorous analyses validated electron&#8208;deficient catechols as millimolar LecA inhibitors. The first co&#8208;crystal structure of a non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitor in complex with a bacterial lectin clearly demonstrates the catechol mimicking the binding of natural glycosides with LecA. Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non&#8208;carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structure to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8208;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li  +  solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make sure superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF. In addition, the Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  (NCM622) full cells show excellent cycling stability (a high capacity of 149 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 200 cycles at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and good rate capability (a capacity of 117 mA h g  &#8208;1  at a high current density of 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) when NCM622 was used as the cathode.

      <title>A Reagent for Amine&#8208;Directed Conjugation to IgG1 Antibodies</title>
      <dc:description>Functionalized antibodies are an indispensable resource for diagnosis, therapy and as a research tool for chemical biology. However, simpler and better methodologies are often required to improve the labeling of antibodies in terms of selectivity and scalability, in particular for the production of antibody drug conjugates. Herein, we report the development of an easily available chemical reagent that allows site&#8208;directed labeling of native human IgG1 antibodies. The labeling procedure has low time demand, and only one reagent is needed. The salicylaldehyde moiety of the reagent reacts with surface exposed lysine residues to transiently form an iminium ion, and this positions a semi&#8208;reactive ester into proximity of a second lysine residue that reacts with the ester to form an amide. Interestingly, it appears that the formation of the iminium ion also has a significant activating effect of the ester. &#160;We show that the reagent can effectively be used to conjugate functionalities of interest to human IgG1 antibodies in good yield and conversion. Moreover, the reagent allows for high control of number of labels per antibody. We use flow cytometry and bio&#8208;layer interferometry to confirm that the labeled antibodies retain antigen binding.</dc:description>

      <title>Transformable Honeycomb&#8208;like Nanoassemblies of Carbon Dots for Regulated Multisite Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems. Herein, we report the development of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots (CDs) to spatially program the delivery of multiple therapeutics for enhanced antitumor chemoimmunotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanoassemblies exhibit effective T cells infiltration, tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis prevention, thereby providing a therapeutic platform for desmoplasia solid tumor.</dc:description>

      <title>Pre&#8208;planarized triphenylamine based linear mixed valence charge transfer systems</title>
      <dc:description>Three linear dimers with two redox active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Of great interest are their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers.
