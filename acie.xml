         <title>Expedient synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen scaffolds via orthogonal tandem catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bridged nitrogen bicyclic skeletons have been accessed via unprecedented site&#8208; and diastereoselective orthogonal tandem catalysis from readily accessible reactants in a step economic manner. Directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H olefination of aminocyclohexane with gem&#8208;dibromoalkenes, followed by a consecutive intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed amidation of the 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;alkenylated product delivers the interesting&#160;normorphan skeleton. The tandem protocol can be applied on substituted aminocyclohexanes and aminoheterocycles, easily providing access to the corresponding substituted, aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;analogues. The Cu catalyst of the Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction additionally avoids off&#8208;cycle Pd catalyst scavenging by alkenylated reaction product. The picolinamide directing group stabilizes the enamine of the 7&#8208;alkylidenenormorphan, allowing further product post functionalizations. Without Cu catalyst, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H olefination is&#160;achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Pseudocapacitive Na+ Intercalation Induced by Cobalt Vacancies at Atomically Thin Co1&#8208;xSe2/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure engineering on electrode materials could bring in a new mechanism to achieve high energy and high power densities in sodium ion batteries. Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe  2  /graphene heterostructure and obtain Co  1&#8208;x  Se  2  /graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na  +  intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na  +  adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na  +  diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability of 576.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 2.0 C and ultra&#8208;long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na  +  storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na  +  intercalation for high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobispyrazole Family as Photoswitches Combining (Near&#8208;) Quantitative Bidirectional Isomerization and Widely Tunable Thermal Half&#8208;Lives from Hours to Years**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobispyrazoles are a family of bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo photoswitches that combine excellent E &#8646; Z photoisomerization yields and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years, showing the great potential of Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het architecture in developing high&#8208;performance molecular photoswitches.







Abstract
Azobenzenes are classical molecular photoswitches that have been widely used. In recent endeavors of molecular design, replacing one or both phenyl rings with heteroaromatic rings has emerged as a strategy to expand molecular diversity and access improved photoswitching properties. Many mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo molecules with unique structures and/or properties have been developed, but the potential of bis&#8208;heteroaryl architectures is far from fully exploited. We report a family of azobispyrazoles, which combine (near&#8208;)quantitative bidirectional photoconversion and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years. The two five&#8208;membered rings remarkably weaken the intramolecular steric hindrance, providing new possibilities for engineering the geometric and electronic structure of azo photoswitches. Azobispyrazoles generally exhibit twisted Z&#8208;isomers that facilitate complete Z&#8594;E photoisomerization, and their thermal stability can be broadly adjusted regardless of the twisted shape, overcoming the conflict between photoconversion (favored by the twisted shape) and Z&#8208;isomer stability (favored by the orthogonal shape) encountered by mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective and Stable Electroreduction of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;based 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was synthesized. With the synergic effect of hexaazatrinaphthylene and copper node, the resultant HATNA&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF displays high selectivity and stability toward the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to methane.







Abstract
2D conjugated MOFs have attracted significant interests in recent years owing to their special structural features and promising physical and chemical properties. These intriguing attributes, to a large extent, stem from the nature of incorporated ligands. The available ligands for the construction of 2D conjugated MOFs are still limited, especially those that have heteroatoms included and exposed to the pores. In this work, we designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA)&#8208;based ligand with two different coordination sites. Through selective coordination, a highly crystalline and porous 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was constructed. Due to the synergic effects of HATNA and copper catecholate node, this HATNA&#8208;based 2D conjugated MOF can mediate the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane with high selectivity of 78&#8201;% at high current density of 8.2&#8197;milliamperes per square centimetre (mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for long durability over 12&#8197;hours.

         <title>Chemical Identification of Catalytically Active Sites on Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheet to Decipher the High Activity for Electro&#8208;synthesis Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) has been demonstrated as highly effective catalyst for electrosynthesizing hydrogen peroxide with mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Chemical titration and DFT calculations were used to decipher the high activity for hydrogen peroxide production; the C=O groups are identified as the most active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an on&#8208;site and clean route. Oxygen&#8208;doped carbon materials with high ORR activity and H2O2 selectivity have been considered as the promising catalysts, however, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence to identify true active sites at the complex carbon surface. Herein, we propose a chemical titration strategy to decipher the oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) catalyst for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR. The OCNS900 exhibits outstanding 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825&#8197;V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C&#8722;OH, and COOH groups, we found that C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

The OCNS&lt;sub&gt;900&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825&#8197;V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C&#8722;OH, and COOH groups, we found that C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Endocircular Li Carbon Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endocircular Li carbon rings exhibit two types of electronic states of very different nature, the ordering of which changes with the ring size. This enables possible interesting applications by excitations from the electronic ground states to states of different nature depending on the ring size.







Abstract
By employing accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many&#8208;electron quantum&#8208;chemistry methods, we establish that monocyclic carbon rings can accommodate Li guest atoms. The low&#8208;lying electronic states of these endocircular systems are analyzed and found to include both charge&#8208;separated states where the guest Li atom appears as a cation and the ring as an anion and encircled&#8208;electron states where Li and the ring are neutral. The electron binding energies of the encircled&#8208;electron states increase drastically at their highly symmetric equilibrium geometries with increasing size of the ring, and in Li@C24, this state becomes the ground state. Li is very weakly bound vertical to the rings in the low&#8208;lying encircled&#8208;electron states, hinting to van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals binding. Applcations are mentioned.

         <title>The First High&#8208;Temperature Supramolecular Radical Ferroics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first supramolecular radical ferroics show paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors, as well as high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity.







Abstract
Organic radical ferroics such as TEMPO have attracted widespread interest. However, the relatively low Curie temperature of 287&#8197;K and melting point of 311&#8197;K severely hinder its application potential. Despite extensive interest, high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics have not yet been found. Here, taking advantage of chemical design and supramolecular radical chemistry, we designed two high&#8208;temperature organic supramolecular radical ferroics [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ReO4) (1) and [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ClO4) (2), which can retain ferroelectricity up to 413&#8197;K and 450&#8197;K, respectively. To our knowledge, they are both the first supramolecular radical ferroics and unprecedented high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics, where the supramolecular component is vital for the stabilization of the radical and extending the working temperature window. Both also have paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, and excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors comparable to that of LiNbO3.

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton, exhibiting through&#8208;space charge transfer emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence effect for white electroluminescence with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power efficiency of 58.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 by solution process.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6&#8201;% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Lignin Oil to Diesel Precursors and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lignin to diesel precursors route was achieved via solar driven coupling reaction over Au/CdS photocatalyst. The diesel precursors can be further hydrogenated to C16&#8211;C18 cyclic hydrocarbons or aromatics over Pd/C or CoMoS&#8208;P, respectively.







Abstract
Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C&#8722;C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co&#8208;generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 dimers and 1.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16&#8211;C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin&#8208;to&#8208;diesel route.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructures by Combining Crystallization&#8208;Driven and Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Hierarchical fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures are accessible by utilizing the unique corona structure of patchy worm&#8208;like micelles immobilized on electrospun polymer fibers and the molecular self&#8208;assembly of a 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamide.

Abstract
Combining the unique corona structure of worm&#8208;like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fiber with the molecular self&#8208;assembly of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like morphology. For this purpose, worm&#8208;like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fiber by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino&#8208;functionalized BTA to induce patch&#8208;mediated molecular self&#8208;assembly to well&#8208;defined fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibers&#8217; surface.

&lt;p&gt;Combining the unique corona structure of worm-like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fiber with the molecular self-assembly of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir-tree-like morphology. For this purpose, worm-like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization-driven self-assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fiber by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino-functionalized BTA to induce patch-mediated molecular self-assembly to well-defined fir-tree-like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibers&#8217; surface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent polymerization for the efficient synthesis of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes was developed. These hyperbranched polymers showed excellent solubility, high quantum yields, tunable emission, and strong ROS generation ability, allowing for their widespread applications in highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning, efficient bacterial killing, and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms.







Abstract
We reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for in situ generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF6, and H2O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011&#215;106) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel visible light&#8208;driven catalytic activation of C=O bonds by exploiting the photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes, readily accessible from &#120572;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, is reported. This mild and environmentally friendly strategy provides an unprecedented and efficient access to the Wolff rearrangement reaction which traditionally entails &#120572;&#8208;diazoketones as the precursors. The resulting ketenes could be precisely trapped by alcohols/thiols to give &#120572;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and by imines to afford the valuable &#120573;&#8208;lactams in up to 99% yields.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;based Synthetic Growth Factor Surrogates with Fine&#8208;tuned Agonism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing synthetic surrogates of functional proteins is an important, albeit challenging, task in the field of chemistry. A strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists for growth factor or cytokine receptors that elicit a desired signal activity has been in high demand, as such ligands hold great promise as safer and more effective therapeutics. In the present study, we used a DNA aptamer as a building block and described the strategy&#8208;guided design of a synthetic receptor agonist with fine&#8208;tuned agonism. The developed synthetic partial agonist can regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting fine&#8208;tuned receptor signaling.</dc:description>

But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1&#8208;0.0033 mol% of chiral N&#8208;methyl pyridoxal 7a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters 6 in 55&#8208;82% yields (for the syn&#8208;diastereomers) with up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7a activates both of the reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency, excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1-0.0033 mol% of chiral N-methyl pyridoxal 7a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;-trifluoromethyl-&#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acid esters 6 in 55-82% yields (for the syn-diastereomers) with up to &amp;gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7a activates both of the reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency, excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Family of Nonribosomal Peptides Modulate Collective Behavior in Pseudovibrio Bacteria Isolated from Marine Sponges**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudovibrio are &#945;&#8208;proteobacteria proposed to contribute to marine sponge health. Lack of reverse genetics have hindered exploration of the ecological and biotechnological potential of Pseudovibrio. Here we describe reverse genetics methods that enabled identification of 12 pseudovibriamides, which we show affect motility and biofilm behavior of Pseudovibrio.







Abstract
Although swarming motility and biofilms are opposed collective behaviors, both contribute to bacterial survival and host colonization. Pseudovibrio bacteria have attracted attention because they are part of the microbiome of healthy marine sponges. Two&#8208;thirds of Pseudovibrio genomes contain a member of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase gene cluster family, which is also found sporadically in Pseudomonas pathogens of insects and plants. After developing reverse genetics for Pseudovibrio, we isolated heptapeptides with an ureido linkage and related nonadepsipeptides we termed pseudovibriamides&#8197;A and B, respectively. A combination of genetics and imaging mass spectrometry experiments showed heptapetides were excreted, promoting motility and reducing biofilm formation. In contrast to lipopeptides widely known to affect motility/biofilms, pseudovibriamides are not surfactants. Our results expand current knowledge on metabolites mediating bacterial collective behavior.

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and spectroscopic signatures of dimeric and monomeric copper species hosted in mordenite and reacting with methane have been identified.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV/Vis and in situ EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.

         <title>Nocathioamides, Uncovered by a Tunable Metabologenomic Approach, Define a Novel Class of Chimeric Lanthipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric Lanthipeptides: Employing a tunable metabologenomic approach, nocathioamides&#8197;A&#8211;C were isolated and elucidated. They inaugurate a new RiPP family, characterized by a unique and hyper degree of modifications, including an intramolecular imide bridge.







Abstract
The increasing number of available genomes, in combination with advanced genome mining techniques, unveiled a plethora of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The products of these BGCs often represent an enormous resource for new and bioactive compounds, but frequently, they cannot be readily isolated and remain cryptic. Here, we describe a tunable metabologenomic approach that recruits a synergism of bioinformatics in tandem with isotope&#8208; and NMR&#8208;guided platform to identify the product of an orphan RiPP gene cluster in the genomes of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 and 0706T. The application of this tactic resulted in the discovery of nocathioamides family as a founder of a new class of chimeric lanthipeptides I.

         <title>Using Light to Modify the Selectivity of Transition Metal Catalysed Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light can be used to switch on or accelerate the catalytic activity of transition metals. However, using light to modify the selectivity of a transformation is considerably less common. This Minireview highlights early examples of controlling catalyst activity in this way and looks at the distinct approaches that have been taken to date.







Abstract
Light has a remarkable and often unique ability to promote chemical reactions. In combination with transition metal catalysis, it offers exciting opportunities to modify catalyst function in a non&#8208;invasive manner, most frequently being reported to switch on or accelerate reactions that do not occur in the dark. However, the ability to completely change reactivity or selectivity between two different reaction outcomes is considerably less common. In this Minireview we bring together examples of this concept and highlight their mechanistically distinct approaches. Our overview demonstrates how these non&#8208;natural, photo&#8208;switchable systems provide key fundamental mechanistic insights, enhancing our understanding and stimulating development of new catalytic activity, and how this might lead to tangible applications, impacting fields such as polymer chemistry.

Our overview demonstrates how these non-natural, photo-switchable systems provide key fundamental mechanistic insights, enhancing our understanding and stimulating development of new catalytic activity, and how this might lead to tangible applications, impacting fields such as polymer chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>H2O&#8208;Built Proton Transfer Bridge Enhances Continuous Methane Oxidation to Methanol over Cu&#8208;BEA Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2O can directly participate in the continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM reaction through a proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;bridge over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu] site of Cu&#8208;BEA zeolite. This can significantly boost CH3OH production rate and enhance long&#8208;term reaction stability.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM) is a big challenge in C1 chemistry. We present a continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM investigation by simultaneously introducing 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O into the reaction system over Cu&#8208;BEA zeolites. Combining a D2O isotopic tracer technique and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, we for the first time demonstrate that the H2O molecules can participate in the reaction through a proton transfer route, wherein the H2O molecules can build a high&#8208;speed proton transfer bridge between the generated moieties of CH3&#8722; and OH&#8722; over the evolved mono(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper ([Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+) active site, thereby pronouncedly boosting the CH3OH selectivity (3.1&#8594;71.6&#8201;%), productivity (16.8&#8594;242.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term reaction stability (10&#8594;70&#8197;h) relative to the scenario of absence of H2O. Unravelling the proton transfer of H2O over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+ site would substantially contribute to highly efficient catalyst designs for the continuous DMTM.

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired, divergent total syntheses of trichodermone and trichoderone A were accomplished from a common biogenetic precursor, aspochalasin Z. Key steps include transannular alkene cyclizations, a singlet oxygen ene reaction, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade reactions. This approach validates the proposed biosynthetic pathway from a chemical perspective and paves the way for the synthesis and characterization of other cytochalasans.







Abstract
We accomplished the divergent total syntheses of ten pentacyclic cytochalasans (aspergillin PZ, trichodermone, trichoderones, flavipesines, and flavichalasines) from a common precursor aspochalasin&#8197;D and revised the structures of trichoderone&#8197;B, spicochalasin&#8197;A, flavichalasine&#8197;C, aspergilluchalasin based on structure network analysis of the cytochalasans biosynthetic pathways and DFT calculations. The key steps of the syntheses include transannular alkene/epoxyalkene and carbonyl&#8208;ene cyclizations to establish the C/D ring of pentacyclic aspochalasans. Our bioinspired approach to these pentacyclic cytochalasans validate the proposed biosynthetic speculation from a chemical view and provide a platform for the synthesis of more than 400 valuable cytochalasans bearing different macrocycles and amino&#8208;acid residues.

         <title>Facilitating the Ferration of Aromatic Substrates through Intramolecular Sodium Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining iron with sodium in tris(amido) complexes has led to the selective ferration of non&#8208;activated arenes being accomplished. A new cooperative mechanism is disclosed, whereby the sodium performs the metal&#8208;H exchange and this is followed by a fast intramolecular trans&#8208;metal trapping of the aryl anion by the iron centre.







Abstract
Exploiting cooperative effects between Na and FeII centres present in tris(amide) ferrate complexes has led to the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene, benzene, toluene, anisole, and pyridine being realised at room temperature. The importance of this bimetallic partnership is demonstrated by neither the relevant sodium amide (NaHMDS or NaTMP) nor the FeII amide Fe(HMDS)2 efficiently metallating these substrates under the conditions of this study. By combining NMR studies with the isolation of key intermediates and DFT calculations, we offer a possible mechanism for how these reactions take place, uncovering a surprising reaction pathway in which the metals cooperate in a synchronised manner. Although the isolated products are formally the result of Fe&#8208;H exchange, theoretical calculations indicate that the aromatic substrates undergo Na&#8208;H exchange followed by fast intramolecular transmetallation to Fe, thus stabilizing the newly generated aryl fragment.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Nonaflate: A Practical Trifluoromethoxylating Reagent and its Application to the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Trifluoromethoxylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethyl nonaflate (TFNf), an odorless liquid (bp 87&#8211;89&#8201;&#176;C), was developed as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, and reactive trifluoromethoxylating reagent that can be easily and safely prepared in large scale. The synthetic potency of TFNf was demonstrated with the synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective direct hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of various alkyne derivatives.







Abstract
The trifluoromethoxy group has elicited much interest among drug and agrochemical discovery teams because of its unique properties. We developed trifluoromethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate (nonaflate), TFNf, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, reactive, and scalable trifluoromethoxylating reagent. TFNf is easily and safely prepared in a simple process in large scale and the nonaflyl part of TFNf can easily be recovered as nonaflyl fluoride after usage and recycled. The synthetic potency of TFNf was showcased with the underexplored synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a high regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of alkyne derivatives such as haloalkynes, alkynyl esters, and alkynyl sulfones. The synthetic merits of TFNf were further underscored with a high&#8208;yielding and smooth nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation of alkyl triflates/bromides and primary/secondary alcohols.

         <title>FRET&#8208;Integrated Polymer Brushes for Spatially Resolved Sensing of Changes in Polymer Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FRET chemistry was integrated within stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer brush layers on planar substrates for spatial sensing of changing polymer conformations. Sensing was demonstrated for a variety of liquid mixture compositions, including high&#8208;resolution observation of lateral differences in polymer conformation at immiscible liquid interfaces (see picture), thus offering great potential to be leveraged for new surface&#8208;based sensing devices.







Abstract
Polymer brush surfaces that alter their physical properties in response to chemical stimuli have the capacity to be used as new surface&#8208;based sensing materials. For such surfaces, detecting the polymer conformation is key to their sensing capabilities. Herein, we report on FRET&#8208;integrated ultrathin (&lt;70&#8197;nm) polymer brush surfaces that exhibit stimuli&#8208;dependent FRET with changing brush conformation. Poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) polymers were chosen due their exceptional sensitivity to liquid mixture compositions and their ability to be assembled into well&#8208;defined polymer brushes. The brush transitions were used to optically sense changes in liquid mixture compositions with high spatial resolution (tens of micrometers), where the FRET coupling allowed for noninvasive observation of brush transitions around complex interfaces with real&#8208;time sensing of the liquid environment. Our methods have the potential to be leveraged towards greater surface&#8208;based sensing capabilities at intricate interfaces.

Our methods have the potential to be leveraged towards greater surface-based sensing capabilities at intricate interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Principle of Water Electrolysis and Recent Progress of Cobalt, Nickel, and Iron&#8208;based Oxides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis that results in green hydrogen is the key process towards a circular economy. The availabilities of the sustainable electricity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst are the main bottlenecks of the process for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production. A broad range of OER electrocatalysts has been explored to decrease the overpotential and boost the kinetics of this sluggish half&#8208;reaction. Co, Ni, and Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been considered to be potential candidates to replace noble metals due to their tunable 3d electron configuration and spin state, versatility in the terms of crystal and electronic structures as well as abundance in nature. This review provides some basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of OER, and significant criteria for the development of the catalysts. It provides also some insights on recent advances of Co, Ni, and Fe&#8208;based oxides and a brief perspective on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via oxidant&#8208;free dehydrocyclization of alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  &#8208;Heterocycles, such as pyrroles, pyrimidines, quinazolines, and quinoxalines are important building blocks for organic chemistry and the fine chemical industry. For their synthesis, catalytic borrowing hydrogen and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols as sustainable reagents have received significant attention in recent years. To overcome the problems of product separation and catalyst reusability, several metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to achieve these transformations with good yields and selectivity. In this review, we summarize the recent developments using both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts to synthesize  N  &#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles  via  acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. Furthermore, this review introduces the preparation and functionalization strategies of the corresponding heterogeneous catalysts, discusses the reaction mechanism and the roles of electron states of metals, and the influence of Lewis acid&#8208;base properties of the support on these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most fundamental transformations for the production of chiral compounds. However, the control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes  via  iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of  meso  dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1  d.r.  and 99%  ee  ) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxyl oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was further demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products Zaragozic acid A and (+)&#8208;Invictolide.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (sub&#8208;10 nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT). During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt&#8208;Co nano&#8208;alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically&#8208;neutral free energy of adsorption of hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt  3  Co@NCNT electrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Reversible Free Radical Catalysis for Environment&#8208;adaptive Cancer Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer&#8208;specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy &#8208; rich Bi&#8208;based regulator that allows environment&#8208;adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically,&#160;the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O  2  &#8226;&#8208;  and  &#8226;  OH in cancer cells  via  logic enzymatic reactions, yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells. Atomic&#8208;level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual&#8208;modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2, a light driven cation channel with a retinal chromophore, undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with several photointermediates. Here, we analyze the chromophore configuration of the intermediates, which can be cryo&#8208;trapped, in detail by DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and reveal that the desensitized state is in a 13&#8208;cis,15&#8208;syn configuration. Our results also shed further light on the photocycle of the protein.







Abstract
Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) is a light&#8208;gated cation channel and was used to lay the foundations of optogenetics. Its dark state X&#8208;ray structure has been determined in 2017 for the wild&#8208;type, which is the prototype for all other ChR variants. However, the mechanistic understanding of the channel function is still incomplete in terms of structural changes after photon absorption by the retinal chromophore and in the framework of functional models. Hence, detailed information needs to be collected on the dark state as well as on the different photointermediates. For ChR2 detailed knowledge on the chromophore configuration in the different states is still missing and a consensus has not been achieved. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state MAS NMR spectroscopy on proteoliposome samples, we unambiguously determined the chromophore configuration in the desensitized state, and we show that this state occurs towards the end of the photocycle.

&lt;p&gt;Channelrhodopsin-2, a light driven cation channel with a retinal chromophore, undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with several photointermediates. Here, we analyze the chromophore configuration of the intermediates, which can be cryo-trapped, in detail by DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy and reveal that the desensitized state is in a 13-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;,15-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; configuration. Our results also shed further light on the photocycle of the protein.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Discovery of a Low Thermal Conductivity Oxide Guided by Probe Structure Prediction and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ba10Y6Ti4O27 has a complex aperiodic structure with the lowest thermal conductivity of any first&#8208;transition&#8208;series oxide. It is metastable, which makes it challenging to identify. Experimental exploration was focused sufficiently by structure prediction and property&#8208;targeted machine learning to enable the isolation of this material (see picture), whose structural motifs provide new insight into the control of heat transport.







Abstract
We report the aperiodic titanate Ba10Y6Ti4O27 with a room&#8208;temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide. The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored. Its isolation thus requires a precisely defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation was achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that would favour synthetically accessible new compositions, and assessment of their properties with machine&#8208;learning models.

         <title>Water Oxidation under Modal Ultrastrong Coupling Conditions Using Au/Ag Alloy Nanoparticles and Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs), a TiO  2  thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal strong coupling conditions with a large splitting energy of 520 meV, which can be categorized into the "ultrastrong coupling regime". We fabricated a photoanode under ultrastrong coupling conditions to verify the relationship between the coupling strength and photoelectric conversion efficiency and successfully performed efficient photochemical reactions. The AATA photoanode showed 4.0% of the maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) obtained at 580 nm, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was 4.1%.These results were attributed to the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency due to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement and relatively negative potential distribution of the hot electrons. Furthermore, hybrid mode&#8208;induced water oxidation using AATA structures was performed with a Faraday efficiency of more than 70% for O  2  evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;compressed OsO6 octahedron resulting in an unprecedented large splitting of the t2g levels and a diamagnetic ground state has been observed.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry. In transition&#8208;element chemistry, the 3d4 and 3d9 configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated with a reduction of the electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na9Bi5Os3O24, the octahedron around Os6+(5d2) is heavily compressed, lifting the degeneracy of the t2g set of 5d orbitals such that in the sense of a JT compression a diamagnetic ground state results. This effect is not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide new insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclic Anhydrides via Ligand&#8208;Enabled C&#8211;H Carbonylation of Simple Aliphatic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids, a new method for the synthesis of a wide range of cyclic anhydrides, is reported. Decarboxylative functionalization of the installed carboxyl group provides access to diverse &#946;&#8208;functionalized aliphatic acids. The enantioselective C&#8211;H carbonylation of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids is also achieved.







Abstract
The development of C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalizations of free carboxylic acids has provided a wide range of versatile C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Y (Y=heteroatom) bond&#8208;forming reactions. Additionally, C&#8211;H functionalizations have lent themselves to the one&#8208;step preparation of a number of valuable synthetic motifs that are often difficult to prepare through conventional methods. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids using Mo(CO)6 as a convenient solid CO source and enabled by a bidentate ligand, leading to convenient syntheses of cyclic anhydrides. Among these, the succinic anhydride products are versatile stepping stones for the mono&#8208;selective introduction of various functional groups at the &#946; position of the parent acids by decarboxylative functionalizations, thus providing a divergent strategy to synthesize a myriad of carboxylic acids inaccessible by previous &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H activation reactions. The enantioselective carbonylation of free cyclopropanecarboxylic acids has also been achieved using a chiral bidentate thioether ligand

         <title>A Fully Coplanar Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymeric Semiconductor with Promoted Charge Separation Kinetics for Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polyarylether&#8208;based polymers with single/double linking patterns were investigated to establish the effect of the linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process in D&#8211;A conjugated polymer photocatalysts, thus achieving remarkable photocatalytic HER and HPER performances.







Abstract
Charge generation and separation are regarded as the major constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein, two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8211;CPs) with distinct linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influence of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results revealed that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linker, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern strengthens donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in PAE&#8211;CPs and generates a coplanar structure, facilitating charge generation and separation, and enabling red&#8208;shifted light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8211;CP interlinked with a double&#8208;stranded linker exhibits markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to that of its single&#8208;strand&#8208;linked analogue. Such findings can facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Two polyarylether-based polymers with single/double linking patterns were investigated to establish the effect of the linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process in D&#8211;A conjugated polymer photocatalysts, thus achieving remarkable photocatalytic HER and HPER performances.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge generation and separation are regarded as the major constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein, two new linear polyarylether-based polymers (PAE&#8211;CPs) with distinct linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs were tailor-made to investigate the influence of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results revealed that compared to the traditional single-stranded linker, the double-stranded linking pattern strengthens donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in PAE&#8211;CPs and generates a coplanar structure, facilitating charge generation and separation, and enabling red-shifted light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8211;CP interlinked with a double-stranded linker exhibits markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to that of its single-strand-linked analogue. Such findings can facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge-induced reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unprecedented Noncanonical Features of the Nonlinear Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Assembly Line for WS9326A Biosynthesis</title>

Systematic manipulation of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains in combination with elucidation of the interactions between the unique domains and structure revealed several hitherto unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A.







Abstract
Systematic inactivation of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains and translocation of the thioesterase (TE) domain revealed several unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of the cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A in Streptomyces sp. SNM55. First, two sets of type &#921;&#921; TE (TE&#921;&#921;)&#8208;like enzymes mediate the shuttling of activated amino acids between two sets of stand&#8208;alone adenylation (A)&#8208;thiolation (T) didomain modules and an &#8220;A&#8208;less&#8221; condensation (C)&#8208;T module with distinctive specificities and flexibilities. This was confirmed by the elucidation of the affinities of the A&#8208;T didomains for the TE&#921;&#921;s and its structure. Second, the C&#8208;T didomain module operates iteratively and independently from other modules in the same protein to catalyze two chain elongation cycles. Third, this biosynthetic pathway includes the first example of module skipping, where the interpolated C and T domains are required for chain transfer.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free, Base&#8208;Promoted 1,2&#8208;Additions of Polyfluorophenylboronates to Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a transition metal&#8208;free procedure for the base&#8208;promoted 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluorophenylboronates to aldehydes and ketones to generate organofluorine&#8208;containing alcohols in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel protocol for the transition metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluoroaryl boronate esters to aldehydes and ketones is reported, which provides secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, and ketones. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that both the ortho&#8208;F substituents on the polyfluorophenyl boronates and the counterion K+ in the carbonate base are critical. The distinguishing features of this procedure include the employment of commercially available starting materials and the broad scope of the reaction with a wide variety of carbonyl compounds giving moderate to excellent yields. Intriguing structural features involving O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding, as well as arene&#8208;perfluoroarene interactions, in this series of racemic polyfluoroaryl carbinols have also been addressed.

         <title>Healable and Rearrangeable Networks of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Diselenide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel exchangeable diselenide chain extender is incorporated into an LCE system, bringing about the reprogrammability and the healability under visible&#8208;light irradiation or upon thermal treatment. These properties enable the utilization of a self&#8208;welding strategy to fabricate the complex LCE&#8208;based soft actuators without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator).







Abstract
Based on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, hierarchically structured soft actuators can meet some requirements for &#8220;human&#8208;friendly&#8221; working mode and execute complex tasks with intelligent adaptation to environmental changes. However, few researchers have paid much attention to the preparation methods of multicomponent/hierarchical LCE actuators. In this communication, we demonstrate the successful integration of an exchangeable diselenide chain extender for the preparation of dynamic LCEs, which could be reprogrammed on heating or under visible light illumination. Moreover, the rearrangeable polydiselenide networks could be applied to develop the self&#8208;welding technology toward fabricating hierarchically structured LCE actuators with sophisticated deformability without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator) during the assembling process.

         <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Photodetachment of Amino Acid Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chirality of chemical compounds is of undisputed importance in science and technology. In particular with respect to pharmacological application most molecules of interest cannot be accessed by the powerful techniques developed in recent years for gas phase analytes. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) with the detection of photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) provides access to chirality information applicable to molecular materials with negligible vapor pressure, e.g. amino acids. To this end, glutamic acid and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) have been electrosprayed into the source of a chirality spectrometer, where photodetachment is enforced and the PECD is detected. The technique can be expected to be conceptually applicable to all chemical systems with chirality based on molecular properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by virtue of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Herein, we designed a novel bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and for the first time combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant  S. aureus  . These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new synergistic strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt; 99%.

         <title>Successive Storage of Cations and Anions by Ligands of &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers Enabling Robust Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) accompanied with anion insertion has the merits of increasing the capacity and elevating the discharge voltages. However, the previous reports on this mechanism either required more investigations or showed low capacity and poor cyclablity. Herein, triphenylene catecholate&#8208;based two dimensional CCPs are constructed by employing inactive transition metal ions (Zn  2+  ) as nodes, forming Zn&#8208;HHTP. Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations indicated the successive storage of cations and anions by redox of only ligands, leading to a high reversible capacity of ~150 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and remarkable capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. On the contrary, as a control experiment, the analogue CCPs (Cu&#8208;HHTP) with Cu  2+  nodes, involved the redox of both ligands and metal ions and accompanied with the storage of only Na  +  &#8208;cations, showing much poorer cyclability. These results highlighted the importance of redox of only ligands for long&#8208;term cycle life and the insight into the storage mechanisms would deepen our understanding on CCPs for further design of CCPs with high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Boron Difluoride Curcuminoid&#8208;Based Polymers Exhibiting Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence as Biological Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared emitting polymers were prepared using four boron&#8208;difluoride curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Well&#8208;defined polymers with molecular weights of ~20 kDa and dispersities &lt; 1.07 were produced and exhibited near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission in solution and in the solid state with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;  PL  ) as high as 0.72. Time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy revealed thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in polymers containing highly planar dopants, whereas room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence dominated with twisted species. Density functional theory demonstrated that rotation about the donor&#8208;acceptor linker can give rise to TADF, even where none would be expected based on calculations using ground&#8208;state geometries. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) gave NIR&#8208;emissive nanoparticles, and conjugation of these Pdots with antibodies enabled immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Organic Fluid Phosphorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has become an accepted approach to construct room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials by suppressing the non&#8208;radiative decay process. However, there is limited success in developing fluid phosphorescence materials due to the ultrafast non&#8208;radiation relaxation of vibration and collision of molecules in fluid matrixes. In this study, a universal deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent strategy was proposed for developing pure organic phosphorescent fluid materials that are able to generate effective phosphorescent emissions at both room temperature (&#934;  RTP, 293 K  ~ 30%) and even higher temperature (&#934;  RTP, 358 K  ~ 4.53%). Based on these findings, a qualitative analytical method was developed for leak detection and a quantitative analytical technique was further validated to help visually identify the heat distribution of irregular surfaces. This advancement greatly empowers the current organic phosphorescent system offering an alternative approach to determine moisture and heat from non&#8208;invasive photoluminescence emission colors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of nanocrystal self&#8208;assembly into superlattices or superstructures is of great significance in nanoscience. Carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs), being a promising new group of nanomaterials, however, have hardly been explored in their self&#8208;organizing behavior. Here we report of a unique irradiation&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization phenomenon of crystalline CNQDs (c&#8208;CNQDs) terminated by abundant oxygen&#8208;containing groups. Unlike the conventional self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into ordered superstructures, the photoinduced self&#8208;assembly of c&#8208;CNQDs resembles a &#8220;click reaction&#8221; process of macromolecules, in which the activated &#8211;OH and &#8211;NH  2  functional groups along the perimeters initiate cross&#8208;linking of adjacent QDs through a photocatalytic effect. Our findings unveil fundamental physiochemical features of CNQDs and open up new possibilities of manipulating carbon nitride nanomaterials via controlled assembly. Prospects for potential applications are discussed as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Isomerization Revitalizes the Coates&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first investigated by Coates nearly four decades ago, is set apart from other variants of the Claisen rearrangement owing to the versatile monoprotected 1,5 dicarbonyl motif featured in the products. Unfortunately, the synthetically elusive nature of the substrates has thus far precluded the widespread application of this attractive transformation. Herein, we show that the key allylic vinyl acetals can be efficiently generated through alkene isomerization of their readily available regioisomeric counterparts (derived from allylic alcohols and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes), thus enabling the first systematic study into the substrate scope of this rearrangement, as well as the discovery of exceptionally mild conditions for its mediation by Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high  &#272;  and one of low  &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and renders them accessible to all researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Single Crystals of Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Oligomer Frameworks Synthesized under Kinetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14664-14670, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various porous organic single crystals were self&#8208;assembled via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, based on in situ&#8208;formed oligomers linked by imine bonds that appeared via condensation between tetratopic amine and ditopic aldehyde compounds. These structures were noted to remain sufficiently robust even after guest removal, and offered accessible porosity that was comparable, or even superior, to that of other COF materials.







Abstract
Various robust, crystalline, and porous organic frameworks based on in situ&#8208;formed imine&#8208;linked oligomers were investigated. These oligomers self&#8208;assembled through collaborative intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions via liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial reactions. The soluble oligomers were kinetic products with multiple unreacted aldehyde groups that acted as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and directed the assembly of the resulting oligomers into 3D frameworks. The sequential formation of robust covalent linkages and highly reversible hydrogen bonds enforced long&#8208;range symmetry and facilitated the production of large single crystals, with structures that were unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The unique hierarchical arrangements increased the steric hindrance of the imine bond, which prevented attacks from water molecules, greatly improving the stability. The multiple binding sites in the frameworks enabled rapid sequestration of micropollutant in water.

&lt;p&gt;Various porous organic single crystals were self-assembled via intermolecular hydrogen bonding, based on in situ-formed oligomers linked by imine bonds that appeared via condensation between tetratopic amine and ditopic aldehyde compounds. These structures were noted to remain sufficiently robust even after guest removal, and offered accessible porosity that was comparable, or even superior, to that of other COF materials.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Metal Nanoparticle Superlattices Enabled by Porphyrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Structures</title>

Chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices with diverse structures were engineered by templating from porphyrin based supramolecular structures. The chirality transfer from molecular systems to colloidal systems is on the basis of weak chain&#8208;chain van der Waals forces.







Abstract
Herein, we show that chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices can be produced through coassembly of achiral metal nanoparticles and porphyrin&#8208;based organic molecules. This chirality transfer from molecules to nanoparticle superstructures across three orders of magnitude in length scale is enabled by the hetero chain&#8208;chain van der Waals interactions. As far as we know, these are the first chiral nanoparticle assemblies based on chirality transfer through weak van der Waals forces. The dimensionality of the nanoparticle superlattices (1D chiral chains, 2D chiral sheets (cones), and 3D chiral particles) can be controlled based on a same synthetic chiral porphyrin molecule. Metalation of these porphyrin molecules with zinc cations results in the switching of molecular packing from J&#8208;type to H&#8208;type, which thereby produces 1D chiral nanoparticle chains. Functionalization of these zinc porphyrins with oleylamine can induce the assembly of nanoparticles into 2D chiral nanoparticle sheets.

A library of ultrasmall multi&#8208;metallic nanoparticles confined in both micro&#8208; and mesopores of molecular sieves was created by the trifunctional templating route.







Abstract
The development of materials integrated with ultrasmall multi&#8208;metal nanoparticles (UMMNs) and mesoporous zeolite is a considerable challenge in chemistry and materials science. We designed a trifunctional surfactant, in which the pyridyl benzimidazole in the hydrophobic tail generates the mesopores through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking; the diquaternary ammonium in the hydrophilic headgroup direct the formation of MFI zeolite sheets and the nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic rings coordinate with various metal ions to form UMMNs confined in the zeolite matrix after calcination and reduction. A library of 56 UMMNs confined within both micropores and mesopores of MFI zeolites (MMZs) with 4 mono&#8208;, 14 bi&#8208; and 38 tri&#8208;metallic nanoparticles (sizes of 1.3&#8211;4.7&#8197;nm) of combinations of Rh, Pd, Pt, Au, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn were made. An improved catalytic performance was exhibited in the sequence of Rh&#8208;MMZ&lt;Rh/Pt&#8208;MMZ&lt;Rh/Pt/Ni&#8208;MMZ for the mild oxidation of methane to methanol or liquid acid.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electro&#8208;reforming of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural on Vertically Oriented Nickel Nanosheet/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts: Structure&#8211;Function Relationships</title>

Highly efficient and stable electro&#8208;reforming of HMF into FDCA on a Ni nanosheet/carbon paper electrode is achieved at a potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with 99.7&#8201;% conversion. A precursor&#8208;limiting electrodeposition method creates a unique Ni nanosheet forest structure with vastly different physical appearance and catalytic activity comparing with conventional Ni catalysts.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;promoted electrocatalytic biomass reforming has shown promising prospect in enabling high value&#8208;added product synthesis. Here, we developed a novel hybrid catalyst with Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper. The hybrid catalyst exhibits high efficiency in electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA coupling with H2 production in high purity. The Ni nanosheets have small crystal grain sizes with abundant edges, which is able to deliver an efficient HMF oxidation to FDCA (selectivity &gt;99&#8201;%) at low potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with high stability. The post&#8208;reaction structure analysis reveals the Ni nanosheets would transfer electrons to carbon and readily turn into NiOx and Ni(OH)x during the reaction. DFT results suggest high valence Ni species would facilitate the chemical adsorption (activation) of HMF revealing the reaction pathway. This work emphasizes the importance of the precise control of Ni activity via atomic structure engineering.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Tracking and Dynamically Quantifying of Reversible Changes of Extracellular Ca2+ in Multiple Brain Regions of Freely Moving Animals</title>

         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array was created to real&#8208;time tracking and reversibly quantifying of extracellular concentration of Ca2+ together with neuron activity across many regions in freely moving mammalian brain for 60&#8197;days. The changing sequence and rate of Ca2+ in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke, and ROS scavenger could protect Ca2+ influx and neuronal activity after stroke.







Abstract
Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. We developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to real&#8208;time quantify extracellular Ca2+ concentrations together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60&#8197;days, in which the signal degradation was &lt; ca. 8&#8201;%. The microarray with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution (ca. 10&#8197;&#956;m, ca. 1.3&#8197;s) was implanted into 7 brain regions of free&#8208;moving mice to monitor reversible changes of extracellular Ca2+ upon ischemia&#8208;reperfusion processes. The changing sequence and rate of Ca2+ in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke. ROS scavenger could protect Ca2+ influx and neuronal activity after stroke, suggesting the significant influence of ROS on Ca2+ overload and neuron death. We demonstrated this microarray is a versatile tool for investigating brain dynamic during pathological processes and drug treatment.

         <title>Hybrid Amyloid&#8208;Based Redox Hydrogel for Bioelectrocatalytic H2 Oxidation</title>

A biohybrid prion&#8208;forming domain was synthesized that is capable of undergoing hierarchical self&#8208;assembly into single&#8208;stranded protein nanowires, nanofibers, and supramolecular redox hydrogels. This property enabled us to immobilize a [NiFeSe] hydrogenase within a water&#8208;swollen network of conductive nanofibers by a gentle non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking process while ensuring its wiring to carbon electrodes for electrocatalysis.







Abstract
An artificial amyloid&#8208;based redox hydrogel was designed for mediating electron transfer between a [NiFeSe] hydrogenase and an electrode. Starting from a mutated prion&#8208;forming domain of fungal protein HET&#8208;s, a hybrid redox protein containing a single benzyl methyl viologen moiety was synthesized. This protein was able to self&#8208;assemble into structurally homogenous nanofibrils. Molecular modeling confirmed that the redox groups are aligned along the fibril axis and are tethered to its core by a long, flexible polypeptide chain that allows close encounters between the fibril&#8208;bound oxidized or reduced redox groups. Redox hydrogel films capable of immobilizing the hydrogenase under mild conditions at the surface of carbon electrodes were obtained by a simple pH jump. In this way, bioelectrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2 were fabricated that afforded catalytic current densities of up to 270&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with an overpotential of 0.33&#8197;V, under quiescent conditions at 45&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Dynamics in Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks to Generate Metal&#8211;Oxide and Metal&#8211;Carbon Networks</title>

Supramolecular metal&#8211;phenolic networks, consisting of metal ions coordinated with phenolic motifs, can undergo selective thermodynamic transformations into nanoporous structures, including metal&#8211;carbon networks and metal&#8211;oxide networks, with tunable network organization and surface wettability.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexation is a powerful strategy for engineering materials in bulk and at interfaces. Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), which are assembled through supramolecular complexes, have emerged as suitable candidates for surface and particle engineering owing to their diverse properties. Herein, we examine the supramolecular dynamics of MPNs during thermal transformation processes. Changes in the local supramolecular network including enlarged pores, ordered aromatic packing, and metal relocation arise from thermal treatment in air or an inert atmosphere, enabling the engineering of metal&#8211;oxide networks (MONs) and metal&#8211;carbon networks, respectively. Furthermore, by integrating photo&#8208;responsive motifs (i.e., TiO2) and silanization, the MONs are endowed with reversible superhydrophobic (&gt;150&#176;) and superhydrophilic (&#8776;0&#176;) properties. By highlighting the thermodynamics of MPNs and their transformation into diverse materials, this work offers a versatile pathway for advanced materials engineering.

         <title>Merging Pincer Motifs and Potential Metal&#8211;Metal Cooperativity in Cobalt Dinitrogen Chemistry: Efficient Catalytic Silylation of N2 to N(SiMe3)3</title>

A ligand scaffold with two fused PNN pincer compartments combines two beneficial features for N2 fixation with molecular catalysts, viz. a bimetallic pocket and ligand&#8208;based protonation sites. Its cobalt(I) dinitrogen complexes are shown to efficiently mediate the reductive silylation of N2.







Abstract
Using a pyrazolate&#8208;bridged dinucleating ligand that provides two proximate pincer&#8208;type PNN binding sites (&#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one pincer&#8221;), different synthetic routes have been developed towards its dicobalt(I) complex 2 that features a twice deprotonated ligand backbone and two weakly activated terminal N2 substrate ligands directed into the bimetallic pocket. Protonation of 2 is shown to occur at the ligand scaffold and to trigger conversion to a tetracobalt(I) complex 4 with two end&#8208;on &#956;1,2&#8208;bridging N2; in THF 4 is labile and undergoes temperature&#8208;dependent N2/triflate ligand exchange. These pyrazolate&#8208;based systems combine the potential of exhibiting both metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity, viz. two concepts that have emerged as promising design motifs for molecular N2 fixation catalysts. Complex 2 serves as an efficient (pre)catalyst for the reductive silylation of N2 into N(SiMe3)3 (using KC8 and Me3SiCl), yielding up to 240&#8197;equiv N(SiMe3)3 per catalyst.

         <title>Human Oxygenase Variants Employing a Single Protein FeII Ligand Are Catalytically Active</title>

A human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate and FeII dependent oxygenase was engineered to possess only one protein FeII binding ligand. The resultant variants retained significant levels of catalytic activity. Biomimetic catalysts containing only one metal binding site are therefore of interest.







Abstract
Aspartate/asparagine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (AspH) is a human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) and FeII oxygenase that catalyses C3 hydroxylations of aspartate/asparagine residues of epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domains (EGFDs). Unusually, AspH employs two histidine residues to chelate FeII rather than the typical triad of two histidine and one glutamate/aspartate residue. We report kinetic, inhibition, and crystallographic studies concerning human AspH variants in which either of its FeII binding histidine residues are substituted for alanine. Both the H725A and, in particular, the H679A AspH variants retain substantial catalytic activity. Crystal structures clearly reveal metal&#8208;ligation by only a single protein histidine ligand. The results have implications for the functional assignment of 2OG oxygenases and for the design of non&#8208;protein biomimetic catalysts.

         <title>Observation of Borane&#8211;Olefin Proximity Interaction Governing the Structure and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;Containing Macrocycles</title>

With borane&#8208;containing macrocyclic polyenes obtained by multi&#8208;step insertion of a strained alkyne into 9&#8208;borafluorene, the first direct crystallographic evidence of attractive borane&#8211;olefin interaction, which is beyond van der Waals force and governs the reactivity of the molecules, is provided.







Abstract
While attractive interactions between borane and olefin have been postulated to trigger various boron&#8208;mediated organic transformations, proximity structures of these functional groups, other than the formation of weak van der Waals complexes, have never been directly observed. Here we show that a close intramolecular borane&#8211;olefin interaction operates in macrocyclic systems containing borane and olefinic groups obtained by multi&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;carboboration between a strained alkyne and 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives. Depending on Lewis acidity of the borane moiety and the size of the macrocycles, the magnitude of interaction changes, resulting in different reaction modes. The whole picture of the multi&#8208;step reactions has been revealed experimentally with theoretical supports. The present finding may not only provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental boron&#8208;mediated interaction but also lead to the development of new organic transformations involving molecular activation by boranes.

         <title>Off&#8208;Set Interactions of Ruthenium&#8211;bda Type Catalysts for Promoting Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>

Tuning the position of substituents on the axial ligand of the popular Ru(bda)L2 water&#8208;splitting catalyst can enable catalysis at low concentrations with high turnover frequencies. Kinetic results indicate superiority of asymmetric catalysts and DFT studies show that this is through positioning of two catalytic units in parallel planes minimizing the X&#8211;&#960; distance and optimizing stacking.







Abstract
O&#8722;O bond formation with Ru(bda)L2&#8208;type catalysts is well&#8208;known to proceed through a bimolecular reaction pathway, limiting the potential application of these catalysts at low concentrations. Herein, we achieved high efficiencies with mononuclear catalysts, with TOFs of 460&#177;32&#8197;s&#8722;1 at high catalyst loading and 31&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 at only 1&#8197;&#956;M catalyst concentration, by simple structural considerations on the axial ligands. Kinetic and DFT studies show that introduction of an off&#8208;set in the interaction between the two catalytic units reduces the kinetic barrier of the second&#8208;order O&#8722;O bond formation, maintaining high catalytic activity even at low catalyst concentrations. The results herein furthermore suggest that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions may only play a minor role in the observed catalytic activity, and that asymmetry can also rationalize high activity observed for Ru(bda)(isoq)2 type catalysts and offer inspiration to overcome the limitations of 2nd order catalysis.

         <title>Discovery of Oligosaccharide Antigens for Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads against Streptococcus suis Serotypes 2, 3, 9 and&#8197;14**
</title>

30 novel oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharides related to four major serotypes (2, 3, 9, 14) of Streptococcus suis (S.&#8197;suis) were synthesized. The conjugation&#8208;ready glycans were used to screen the sera of pigs and rabbits. With a glycan array study, glycan epitopes of lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines to protect from S.&#8197;suis serotypes 2 and 9 were identified.







Abstract
Streptococcus suis bacteria are one of the most serious health problems for pigs and an emerging zoonotic agent in humans working in the swine industry. S.&#8197;suis bacteria express capsular polysaccharides (CPS) a major bacterial virulence factor that define the serotypes. Oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of S. suis serotypes 2, 3, 9, and 14 have been synthesized, glycans related to serotypes 2 and 9 were placed on glycan array surfaces to screen blood from infected pigs. Lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic S. suis serotypes 2 and 9 glycoconjugate veterinary vaccines were identified in this way.

         <title>Wearable Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Achieved by a Crystallographic Size Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14693-14700, June 21, 2021. </description>

We developed a size effect that controls the crystallization of perovskite and enhances the passivation effect with g&#8208;C3N4 additive. The similarity in value of lattice constant and distance between double hydrogen binding sites affects crystallization. The combination allows g&#8208;C3N4 to cover tin&#8208;based perovskite, thus improves hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance of films and leads to splendid PCE of wearable device with excellent stability.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrate a potential application in wearable electronics due to its hypotoxicity. However, poor crystal quality is still the bottleneck for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible devices. In this work, graphite phase&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4) is applied into tin&#8208;based perovskite as a crystalline template, which delays crystallization via a size&#8208;effect and passivates defects simultaneously. The double hydrogen bond between g&#8208;C3N4 and formamidine cation can optimize lattice matching and passivation. Moreover, the two&#8208;dimensional network structure of g&#8208;C3N4 can fit on the crystals, resulting an enhanced hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance. Therefore, the flexible tin&#8208;based PSCs with g&#8208;C3N4 realize a stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.56&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. In addition, the PSCs can maintain 91&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1000&#8197;h under N2 environment and keep 92&#8201;% of their original PCE after 600&#8197;cycles at a curvature radius of 3&#8197;mm.

A bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system is established by integrating bipolar electrochemistry with a redox&#8208;controlled micelle disruption process. Using the BEMD approach, gradient and patterned organic films with a wide range of a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules, were successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Bipolar electrochemistry could be regarded as a powerful approach for selective surface modification due to the beneficial feature that a wirelessly controllable potential distribution on bipolar electrodes (BPEs). Herein we report a bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system for the preparation of shaped organic films. A U&#8208;shaped bipolar electrolytic system with a sigmoidal potential gradient on the BPE gave gradient&#8208;thin films including various interesting organic compounds, such as a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules. The gradient feature was characterized by UV&#8211;Vis absorption, thickness measurements and surface morphology analysis. Corresponding patterned films were also fabricated using a cylindrical bipolar electrolytic setup that enables site&#8208;selective application of the potential on the BPE. Such a facile BEMD approach will open a long&#8208;term perspective with respect to organic film preparation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14473-14479, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based 2D conductive MOFs were developed and employed as electrocatalysts for converting CO2 into CH3OH. Cu3(HHTQ)2 with electron&#8208;deficient but nitrogen&#8208;rich TQ cores displays the best electrocatalytic CO2RR performance, showing high selectivity toward CH3OH with Faradic efficiency up to 53.6&#8201;% at a low overpotential of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V and maintained good durability.







Abstract
2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are promising candidates for efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based multitopic catechol ligand was used to coordinate with transition&#8208;metal ions (Cu2+ and Ni2+), which formed 2D graphene&#8208;like porous sheets: M3(HHTQ)2 (M=Cu, Ni; HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;Hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline). M3(HHTQ)2 can be regarded as a single&#8208;atom catalyst where Cu or Ni centers are uniformly distributed in the hexagonal lattices. Cu3(HHTQ)2 exhibited superior catalytic activity towards CO2RR in which CH3OH is the sole product. The Faradic efficiency of CH3OH reached up to 53.6&#8201;% at a small over&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V. Cu3(HHTQ)2 exhibited larger CO2 adsorption energies and higher activities over the isostructural Ni3(HHTQ)2 and the reported archetypical Cu3(HHTP)2. There is a strong dependence of both metal centers and the N&#8208;rich ligands on the electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Interfacial Polymerization at the Alkane/Ionic Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14636-14643, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface has been designed. The extendibility, designability, and controllability brought by the ionic liquid replace the instability and low solubility caused by water in conventional polymerization. The polyamide nanofilms synthesized at the new delicate water&#8208;insoluble monomer interfaces possess adjustable pore size and exhibit unprecedented performance in various separation applications.







Abstract
Polymerization at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface has attracted much attention for synthesizing ultrathin polymer films for molecular sieving. However, it remains a major challenge to conduct this process outside the alkane&#8211;water interface since it not only suffers water&#8208;caused side reactions but also is limited to water&#8208;soluble monomers. Here, we report the interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface (IP@AILI) where the ionic liquid acts as the universal solvent for diversified amines to synthesize task&#8208;specific polyamide nanofilms. We propose that IP@AILI occurs when acyl chloride diffuses from the alkane into the ionic liquid instead of being triggered by the diffusion of amines as in the conventional alkane&#8211;water system, which is demonstrated by thermodynamic partitioning and kinetic monitoring. The prepared polyamide nanofilms with precisely adjustable pore sizes display unprecedented permeability and selectivity in various separation processes.

         <title>Correlation between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity for a Model Electrode: PrBaCo2O5+&#948;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14609-14619, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies content and ordering are influencing the oxygen evolution reaction activity of one of the most active perovskite electrocatalyst, PrBaCo2O5+&#948;. It is suggested that a high oxygen vacancy content in the perovskite lattice is beneficial for the activity, while lattice oxygen ordering leads to a drop in the OER activity.







Abstract
The role of the perovskite lattice oxygen in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically studied in the PrBaCo2O5+&#948; family. The reduced number of physical/chemical variables combined with in&#8208;depth characterizations such as neutron dif&#8208;fraction, O K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), magnetization and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies, helps investigating the complex correlation between OER activity and a single perovskite property, such as the oxygen content. Larger amount of oxygen vacancies appears to facilitate the OER, possibly contributing to the mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen, i.e., the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Furthermore, not only the number of vacancies but also their local arrangement in the perovskite lattice influences the OER activity, with a clear drop for the more stable, ordered stoichiometry.

PEGylated, phenylboronic acid modified L&#8208;DOPA&#8208;derived nanoparticles (pPADN) specifically integrated reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and anti&#8208;inflammatory drug delivery to treat osteoarthritis. The pPADN sensed and eliminated elevated ROS via cascade oxidative reactions and delivered glucocorticoids to the site of inflammation.







Abstract
We have synthesized a PEGylated, phenylboronic acid modified L&#8208;DOPA pro&#8208;antioxidant (pPAD) that can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (pPADN) for the loading of a model glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) through 1,3&#8208;diol/phenylboronic acid chemistry and hydrophobic interactions for more effective treatment of inflammation. Upon exposure to ROS, pPADN convert into the active form of L&#8208;DOPA, and a cascade of oxidative reactions transform it into antioxidative melanin&#8208;like materials. Concomitantly, the structural transformation of pPADN triggers the specific release of Dex, along with the acidic pH of inflammatory tissue. In a rat model of osteoarthritis, Dex&#8208;loaded pPADN markedly mitigate synovial inflammation, suppress joint destruction and cartilage matrix degradation, with negligible in vivo toxicity. Moreover, in situ structural transformation makes pPADN suitable for noninvasive monitoring of therapeutic effects as a photoacoustic imaging contrast agent.

         <title>Intrinsic Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution of Crystalline 3d&#8208;Transition Metal Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14446-14457, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activities for oxygen evolution on crystalline 3d transition metal layered double hydroxides are derived using electrochemical surface area based normalization. Density functional calculations reveal a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;site feature of the reaction centers that provides opportunities to design new catalysts with improved performance.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are among the most active and studied catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. However, previous studies have generally either focused on a small number of LDHs, applied synthetic routes with limited structural control, or used non&#8208;intrinsic activity metrics, thus hampering the construction of consistent structure&#8211;activity&#8208;relations. Herein, by employing new individually developed synthesis strategies with atomic structural control, we obtained a broad series of crystalline &#945;&#8208;MA(II)MB(III) LDH and &#946;&#8208;MA(OH)2 electrocatalysts (MA=Ni, Co, and MB=Co, Fe, Mn). We further derived their intrinsic activity through electrochemical active surface area normalization, yielding the trend NiFe LDH &gt; CoFe LDH &gt; Fe&#8208;free Co&#8208;containing catalysts &gt; Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Our theoretical reactivity analysis revealed that these intrinsic activity trends originate from the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;site nature of the reaction centers, which lead to composition&#8208;dependent synergies and diverse scaling relationships that may be used to design catalysts with improved performance.

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14707-14714, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise regulation of protein activity is important to understand complex biological signaling networks and to devise new therapeutic approaches. Here, we use either polyaptamers or split aptamer&#8208;conjugated AuNPs to inhibit the activity of thrombin. Mechanical force generated by ultrasound is exploited to activate thrombin, thereby catalyzing the formation of fibrin from fibrinogen.







Abstract
The regulation of enzyme activity is a method to control biological function. We report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for secondary hemostasis. First, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin, inhibiting its catalytic activity. With ultrasound generating inertial cavitation and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound, the interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved, restoring the activity to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Second, we used split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates reversibly disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. We envision that this approach will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli in the sonogenetics field.

         <title>Tailored Synthesis of Skeletally Diverse Stemona Alkaloids through Chemoselective Dyotropic Rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;Lactones</title>

Three types of multisubstituted chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones have been constructed in a predictable and controllable manner through chemoselective dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones involving alkyl, hydrogen, and aryl migration. These transformations enabled the tailored synthesis of a series of skeletally diverse Stemona alkaloids with high efficiency (see scheme).







Abstract
The collective synthesis of skeletally diverse Stemona alkaloids featuring tailored dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones as key elements is described. Specifically, three typical 5/7/5 tricyclic skeletons associated with stemoamide, tuberostemospiroline and parvistemonine were first accessed through chemoselective dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones involving alkyl, hydrogen, and aryl migration, respectively. By the rational manipulation of substrate structures and reaction conditions, these dyotropic rearrangements proceeded with excellent efficiency, good chemoselectivity and high stereospecificity. Furthermore, several polycyclic Stemona alkaloids, including saxorumamide, isosaxorumamide, stemonine and bisdehydroneostemoninine, were obtained from the aforementioned tricyclic skeletons through late&#8208;stage derivatizations. A novel visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] cycloaddition was also developed, which offers a valuable tool for accessing oxaspirobutenolide and related scaffolds.

         <title>The Electrophilicity of Surface Carbon Species in the Redox Reactions of CuO&#8208;CeO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14420-14428, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the oxidation of CO over the surface of a CuO&#8208;CeO2 catalyst, electrons are simultaneously transferred from Cu0 to lattice Ce4+ and surface carbon species deposited from CO. These &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support&#8211;carbon interactions&#8221; (EMSCI) are thought to play an important role in the reactions involving the support and surface carbon species in C1 chemistry.







Abstract
Electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSI) describe the electron flow between metal sites and a metal oxide support. It is generally used to follow the mechanism of redox reactions. In this study of CuO&#8208;CeO2 redox, an additional flow of electrons from metallic Cu to surface carbon species is observed via a combination of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, near ambient pressure near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. An electronic metal&#8211;support&#8211;carbon interaction (EMSCI) is proposed to explain the reaction pathway of CO oxidation. The EMSCI provides a complete picture of the mass and electron flow, which will help predict and improve the catalytic performance in the selective activation of CO2, carbonate, or carbonyl species in C1 chemistry.

         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complexes as catalysts. Direct vinylogous additions via dienolates of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes were realized. A series of chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones were synthesized in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex catalysts. The vinyl epoxides, as masked &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, via direct vinylogous additions with isatins, 2&#8208;alkenoylpyridines or methyleneindolinones, provided a facile and efficient way for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones, respectively with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual&#8208;tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Spin State Cobalt Cations in Spinel Zinc Cobalt Oxide for Spin Channel Propagation and Active Site Enhancement in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14536-14544, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering high&#8208;spin state cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 propagates a spin channel for spin&#8208;selected charge transport and enhances active sites for intermediate adsorption. High&#8208;spin cobalt cations can be directly engineered by varying the calcination temperature.







Abstract
Spinel zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo2O4) is not considered as a superior catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck reaction in water&#8208;electrolysis. Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low&#8208;spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t2g6eg0 configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin&#8208;selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high&#8208;spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo2O4, while not working for Co3O4. The activity of the best spin&#8208;state&#8208;engineered ZnCo2O4 outperforms other typical Co&#8208;based oxides.

&lt;p&gt;Spinel zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is not considered as a superior catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck reaction in water-electrolysis. Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low-spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin-selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high-spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, while not working for Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The activity of the best spin-state-engineered ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; outperforms other typical Co-based oxides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Surgery at Microporous MOF for Mesopore Generation and Renovation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14601-14608, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plane&#8208;oriented mesopore formation and closure in microporous MOFs were demonstrated mimicking the surgical operation but at molecular level. The established strategy enables formation of hierarchical MOF with tunable porosity. The anisotropic nature of the MOF lattice planes enabled not only engineering the mesopore size and volume, but also controlling the pore shape that could be beneficial for certain kind of new applications in the MOF field.







Abstract
Hierarchically porous MOFs (HP&#8208;MOFs) present advantageous synergism of micro&#8208; and mesopore but challenging in synthetic control at molecular scale. Herein, we present the first example of reversible and controllable mesopore generation and renovation in a microporous MOF of HKUST&#8208;1 via synthetic manipulation at molecular scale. An ammonia&#8208;gas etching strategy is proposed to create mesopores in carboxylate&#8208;based microporous MOFs and thus produce HP&#8208;MOFs. Gas&#8208;phase etching ensures uniform mesopore formation inside the MOF crystals via plane&#8208;oriented cutting the carboxylate&#8208;metal bonds off without affecting the crystal size and morphology. The mesopore size is controlled by the etching temperature, while the mesopore volume could be tuned by adjusting etchant pressure. The generated mesopores could be renovated using MOF precursors solutions so that to achieve controllable mesopore generation/closure, and encapsulation of the adsorbed molecules. This work demonstrates a powerful protocol for precisely tailoring and tuning the properties of MOF materials at molecular scale.

         <title>carba Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate: Robust Cofactor for Redox Biocatalysis</title>

A robust cofactor analog (carba&#8208;NADP+) is described here with a 33&#8208;times longer half&#8208;life time when the cofactor is heated up to 50&#8201;&#176;C. Decomposition experiments on the reduced form at low pH values showed a drastic increase in stability. The cofactor is found to make a significant contribution to the field of redox&#8208;biocatalysis under harsh conditions retaining most of its enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Here we report a new robust nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate cofactor analog (carba&#8208;NADP+) and its acceptance by many enzymes in the class of oxidoreductases. Replacing one ribose oxygen with a methylene group of the natural NADP+ was found to enhance stability dramatically. Decomposition experiments at moderate and high temperatures with the cofactors showed a drastic increase in half&#8208;life time at elevated temperatures since it significantly disfavors hydrolysis of the pyridinium&#8208;N&#8722;glycoside bond. Overall, more than 27 different oxidoreductases were successfully tested, and a thorough analytical characterization and comparison is given. The cofactor carba&#8208;NADP+ opens up the field of redox&#8208;biocatalysis under harsh conditions.

         <title>Simultaneous Broadening and Enhancement of Cr3+ Photoluminescence in LiIn2SbO6 by Chemical Unit Cosubstitution: Night&#8208;Vision and Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Applications</title>

Controllable photoluminescence tuning of ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], and its potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopic applications is demonstrated.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting phosphor materials have been extensively developed for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor with emission peak at 965&#8197;nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217&#8197;nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892&#8197;nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], which can be ascribed to the upshift of 4T2g energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235&#8197;nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.

We report herein the photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes using newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2. The hydroborated products were obtained under mild conditions in high yields, excellent diastereoselectivities, a high functional group tolerance and developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. Finally, the reaction mechanism was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes is reported. The use of newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2 permits the formation a boryl radical, which is used for hydroboration of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes. The hydroborated products were isolated in high yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and a high functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The hydroboration reactions were developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. The reaction mechanism was studied and suggested an oxidation reaction between an in situ formed borate and the Cu&#8208;photocatalyst in its excited state for the boryl radical formation.

Active sites for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO were experimentally identified for the first time using atomically well&#8208;defined Au nanoclusters. The partially dethiolated Au site bridging S and Au atoms in the staple motif exhibits higher charge density and upshift of d&#8208;states, which promote the catalytic process by stabilizing the reaction intermediate.







Abstract
Accurate identification of active sites is critical for elucidating catalytic reaction mechanisms and developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the atomic&#8208;level identification of active sites using atomically well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) Au25, Au38, and Au144 as model catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The studied Au NCs exhibited remarkably high CO2RR activity, which increased with increasing NC size. Electrochemical and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the Au NCs were activated by removing one thiolate group from each staple motif at the beginning of CO2RR. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed higher charge densities and upshifts of d&#8208;states for dethiolated Au sites. The structure&#8211;activity properties of the studied Au NCs confirmed that dethiolated Au sites were the active sites and that CO2RR activity was determined by the number of active sites on the cluster surface.

         <title>Discovery of First Magnesium Fluorooxoborate with Stable Fluorine Terminated Framework for Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Application</title>

The first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO application. More importantly, we demonstrated that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.







Abstract
The generated light can be tuned to cover almost the entire spectral range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths by utilizing the nonlinear optical crystals with a simple frequency doubling process. Among them, the discovery of novel candidates for the production of deep&#8208;ultraviolet light is by extension a great challenge toward realizing the vast potential. Actually, the availability for this process mainly depends on whether the critical performance can be well coexisted in one practical crystal. Herein, the first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical application. It has a sufficiently large nonlinearity and a deep&#8208;ultraviolet phase matching wavelength, indicating that it holds great potential for the production of coherent light below 200&#8197;nm. The critical performance enhancement of MgB5O7F3 when compared with its isomorphic phases was demonstrated and discussed. More importantly, we proposed that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.

Enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning of heme reactivity: Free&#8208;electron laser crystal structures of two different heme&#8208;containing peroxidases&#8212;cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase&#8212;show differences in the nature of the ferryl species. Precise enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning within structurally similar heme active sites is implicated.







Abstract
Oxygen activation in all heme enzymes requires the formation of high oxidation states of iron, usually referred to as ferryl heme. There are two known intermediates: Compound I and Compound II. The nature of the ferryl heme&#8212;and whether it is an FeIV=O or FeIV&#8208;OH species&#8212;is important for controlling reactivity across groups of heme enzymes. The most recent evidence for Compound I indicates that the ferryl heme is an unprotonated FeIV=O species. For Compound II, the nature of the ferryl heme is not unambiguously established. Here, we report 1.06&#8197;&#197; and 1.50&#8197;&#197; crystal structures for Compound II intermediates in cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), collected using the X&#8208;ray free electron laser at SACLA. The structures reveal differences between the two peroxidases. The iron&#8208;oxygen bond length in CcP (1.76&#8197;&#197;) is notably shorter than in APX (1.87&#8197;&#197;). The results indicate that the ferryl species is finely tuned across Compound I and Compound II species in closely related peroxidase enzymes. We propose that this fine&#8208;tuning is linked to the functional need for proton delivery to the heme.

A series of pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating nanoprobes that dually respond to acidity and myeloperoxidase of phagosome in inflammatory macrophages were synthesized. The nanoparticles exhibit excellent imaging capability for identification of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes in diverse animal tumor models.







Abstract
Noninvasive imaging strategies have been extensively investigated for in vivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the current imaging strategies fail to accurately assess tumor metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity. Here we report pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles, which integrate chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) and signal amplification strategy, enabling accurate identification of metastatic SLNs. After draining into lymph nodes, the nanoparticles were phagocytosed and dissociated in acidic phagosomes of inflammatory macrophages to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescent light. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully differentiated tumor metastatic lymph nodes from benign ones. These nanoparticles also exhibited excellent imaging capability for early detection of metastatic SLNs in diverse animal tumor models with small tumor volume (100&#8211;200&#8197;mm3).

         <title>Structural and Functional Analyses of the Tridomain&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase FmoA3 for 4&#8208;Methyloxazoline Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14554-14562, June 21, 2021. </description>

The dimeric structure of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), FmoA3 which consists of Cy&#8208;A&#8208;PCP domains, was solved by two strategies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. The molecular basis of the &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid recognition mechanism of the A domain of FmoA3 was proposed. The Cy domain of FmoA3 was expected to lose peptide bond formation activity by eliminating its ability to bind with a donor PCP.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides. FmoA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It uses &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine to synthesize a 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X&#8208;ray crystallography (apo&#8208;form, with adenylyl&#8208;imidodiphosphate and &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;seryl&#8208;AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activity. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides. FmoA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It uses &#945;-methyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine to synthesize a 4-methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head-to-tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X-ray crystallography (&lt;i&gt;apo&lt;/i&gt;-form, with adenylyl-imidodiphosphate and &#945;-methyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-seryl-AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945;-methyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activity. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.&lt;/p&gt;

Selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral nanocrystal quantum dots yielded the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna architecture, which manifests an electromagnetic&#8208;photocatalytic hotspot at its epicenter.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down fabricated nanoantenna architectures of both metallic and dielectric materials show powerful functionalities for Raman and fluorescence enhancement with relevance to single molecule sensing while inducing directionality of chromophore emission with implications for single photon sources. We synthesize the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna by selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) forming a dimer. While the tetrahedral monomers emit non&#8208;polarized light, the bow&#8208;tie architecture manifests nanoantenna functionality of enhanced emission polarization along the bow&#8208;tie axis, as predicted theoretically and revealed by single&#8208;particle spectroscopy. Theory also predicts the formation of an electric&#8208;field hotspot at the bow&#8208;tie epicenter. This is utilized for selective light&#8208;induced photocatalytic metal growth at that location, unlike growth on the free tips in dark conditions, thus demonstrating bow&#8208;tie dimer functionality as a photochemical reaction center.

         <title>Poly&#8208;Adenine&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient Live&#8208;Cell MicroRNA Capture</title>

PolyA&#8208;SNAs (poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids) exhibit high cell entry efficiency and programmable lateral spacing of anti&#8208;microRNA (miRNA) units, enabling efficient miRNA capture in living cells and mice. The in vivo inhibition of oncogenic miRNA results in potent suppression of tumor growth.







Abstract
Direct delivery of exogenous non&#8208;coding nucleic acids into living cells has attracted intense interest in biological applications. However, the cell entry efficiency and target capture ability remain to be improved. Herein, we report a method for compartmenting the nucleic acids on the surface of poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (polyA&#8208;SNAs) for efficient capture of oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. We find that polyA&#8208;SNAs exhibit high cell entry efficiency, which is insensitive to the configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences. By programming the length of polyAs, we precisely engineered the spatial configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences in polyA&#8208;SNAs. Compartmentalized polyA&#8208;SNAs bind to miRNAs with improved capture ability as compared to densely compacted SNAs. We further demonstrate that polyA&#8208;SNAs serve as high&#8208;efficacy miRNA sponges for capturing oncogenic miRNAs both in living cells and in mice. The efficient inhibition of miRNAs results in significant suppression of tumor growth.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ionic Organic Microcrystals</title>

As a result of the efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated chirality transfer and light&#8208;harvesting energy transfer, well&#8208;ordered ionic microcrystals formed between pyridine&#8208;containing achiral molecules and chiral camphor sulfonic acid display full&#8208;color and homogeneously white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with &#934;FL of up to 80&#8201;% and glum in the order of 10&#8722;2.







Abstract
A simple and general method is presented herein for the in situ preparations of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active microcrystals with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor glum, high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#934;FL), wide emission color tenability, and well&#8208;ordered morphology. The reactions of pyridine&#8208;containing achiral molecules 1&#8211;7 with chiral camphor sulfonic acid ((&#177;)&#8208;CSA) gave crystalline microplates formed by hydrogen bonding interactions between the protonated pyridinium units and the sulfonic anions. The chiral information of CSA are effectively transferred to the microcrystals by hydrogen bonding to afford full&#8208;color CPL from deep&#8208;blue to red with glum in the order of 10&#8722;2 and &#934;FL up to 80&#8201;%. Moreover, organic microcrystals with high&#8208;performance white CPL (&#934;FL=46&#8201;%; |glum|=0.025) are achieved via the light&#8208;harvesting energy transfer between blue and yellow emitters.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Superprotonic Conductivity of MOF&#8208;808 Achieved by Controlling the Binding Mode of Grafted Sulfamate (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
The superprotonic conductivity of sulfamate&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 is described by Yung&#8197;Sam Kim, Seung&#8197;Bin Baek, Myoung Soo Lah, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;14334. The modulation of the binding mode of the grafted sulfamate from the monodentate mode to the bridging bidentate mode resulted in more efficient proton conduction by generating more acidic cationic sulfiliminium groups (&#8211;S=NH2+).

2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks show promising applications in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol. In their Research Article on page&#8197;14473, Yanhang Ma, Shubin Yang, Long Chen, and co&#8208;workers report a new nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) copper(II) catecholate based MOF (Cu3(HHTQ)2). This MOF exhibits high crystallinity, good electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic activity in CO2RR with high selectivity for CH3OH production.

Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. In their Research Article on page&#8197;14429, Yang Tian and co&#8208;workers developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to monitor in real time the reversible changes and quantify extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60 days. Based on this powerful new sensor, the significant influence of ROS on Ca2+ overload and neuron death was discovered during pathogenesis and the treatment of stroke.

Dynamic color is essential for practical applications such as dynamic displays, sensors, cryptography, and camouflage. In their Communication on page 14307, Mingzhu Li et&#8197;al. demonstrate a flexible, mechanically triggered color switchable sheet based on a photonic crystal&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane kirigami (PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami) inspired by the structural color modulation of the male hummingbird. The PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami shows precisely programmable structural color and keeps the color very well after recycling over 10&#8201;000 times.

         <title>Amine&#8211;Boranes as Transfer Hydrogenation and Hydrogenation Reagents: A Mechanistic Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14272-14294, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on the growing area of transfer hydrogenation (TH) using amine&#8211;boranes, looking specifically at the mechanisms by which TH takes place. There are three distinct pathways of TH: 1)&#8197;classical TH process where double hydrogen transfer comes from both amine and borane; 2)&#8197;nonclassical TH process where hydroboration from the amine&#8211;borane is followed by solvolysis; and 3)&#8197;hydrogenation from H2 release.







Abstract
Transfer hydrogenation (TH) has historically been dominated by Meerwein&#8211;Ponndorf&#8211;Verley (MPV) reactions. However, with growing interest in amine&#8211;boranes, not least ammonia&#8211;borane (H3N&#8901;BH3), as potential hydrogen storage materials, these compounds have also started to emerge as an alternative reagent in TH reactions. In this Review we discuss TH chemistry using H3N&#8901;BH3 and their analogues (amine&#8211;boranes and metal amidoboranes) as sacrificial hydrogen donors. Three distinct pathways were considered: 1)&#8197;classical TH, 2)&#8197;nonclassical TH, and 3)&#8197;hydrogenation. Simple experimental mechanistic probes can be employed to distinguish which pathway is operating and computational analysis can corroborate or discount mechanisms. We find that the pathway in operation can be perturbed by changing the temperature, solvent, amine&#8211;borane, or even the substrate used in the system, and subsequently assignment of the mechanism can become nontrivial.

         <title>Chemical Conversion and Locking of the Imine Linkage: Enhancing the Functionality of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14236-14250, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of the reversible imine connection has been instrumental for the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, to ensure the generation of more robust, functional, and conjugated materials, alternative linkages based on the chemical locking and conversion of the imine bond have been devised. This Minireview focuses on examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards COFs beyond the imine linkage.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation. This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.

         <title>Tethering Flexible Polymers to Crystalline Porous Materials: A Win&#8211;Win Hybridization Approach</title>

This minireview highlights state of the art for the hybrid materials formed by tethering crystalline porous materials with flexible polymers via strong chemical bonds, and provides a perspective on their potential applications and future directions.







Abstract
Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied over the past few decades due to their well&#8208;defined, customizable, and porous structures. However, the limited stability and machinability restrict their particle applications. Recently, a new trend to use hybrid strategies to bridge the gap between CPMs and flexible polymers has emerged as an effective solution to tackle the above issues. Polymers can be either cross&#8208;linked within the framework or anchored to the outer surface of the materials, that endow CPMs with polymer features, such as flexibility, ductility, and machinability. Such resulting polymer&#8208;tethered CPMs (named as polyCPMs) have demonstrated improved performances in many application scopes such as membrane separation, heterogeneous catalysis and smart response. This minireview highlights state of the art for the hybridization strategies of CPMs with flexible polymers, and provide a perspective on their potential applications and future directions.

         <title>Strategies for the Syntheses of Pactamycin and Jogyamycin</title>

The aminocyclopentitol natural products pactamycin and jogyamycin are challenging synthetic targets, due to the dense polar functionality displayed in the core cyclopentane ring. This review describes strategies that have been developed for the total syntheses of these potent antimalarial compounds.







Abstract
Pactamycin and jogyamycin are aminocyclopentitol natural products, where each core carbon bears a stereodefined alcohol or amine moiety. Their structural complexity, coupled with the diversity of functional groups coexisting in a condensed space, make them fascinating synthetic targets in their own right. Pactamycin and its derivatives bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit and display activity against parasites responsible for drug&#8208;resistant malaria and African sleeping sickness; however, efforts to develop their therapeutic potential have been hampered by their cellular toxicity. Interestingly, bioengineered analogues display differences in selectivity and toxicity towards mammalian cells, spurring efforts to develop flexible strategies to thoroughly probe structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR), particularly in analogues lacking the C7 hydroxyl group of pactamycin. This review compares and contrasts approaches towards pactamycin and jogyamycin, including two successful total syntheses of the former. The implications of each route for preparing analogues to inform SAR and lead to compounds with increased selectivity for binding malarial over human ribosomes are briefly discussed.

Cu(ts) both ways: Carbene&#8208;supported copper&#8208;alumanyl complexes, [LCu&#8208;Al(SiNDipp)], display divergent reactivity with carbodiimides and CO2, implying an ambiphilicity in the Cu&#8211;Al interaction that is dependent on the identity of the carbene co&#8208;ligand.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;alumanyl complexes, [LCu&#8208;Al(SiNDipp)], where L=carbene=NHCiPr (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and Me2CAAC (1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and featuring unsupported Al&#8722;Cu bonds, have been prepared. Divergent reactivity observed with carbodiimides and CO2 implies an ambiphilicity in the Cu&#8211;Al interaction that is dependent on the identity of the carbene co&#8208;ligand.

&lt;p&gt;Copper-alumanyl complexes, [LCu-Al(SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;)], where L=carbene=NHC&lt;sup&gt;iPr&lt;/sup&gt; (N,N&#8242;-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethyl-2-ylidene) and &lt;sup&gt;Me2&lt;/sup&gt;CAAC (1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrrolidin-2-ylidene) and featuring unsupported Al&#8722;Cu bonds, have been prepared. Divergent reactivity observed with carbodiimides and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; implies an ambiphilicity in the Cu&#8211;Al interaction that is dependent on the identity of the carbene co-ligand.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Copper&#8211;DNAzyme Nanohybrids for Dual&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14324-14328, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohybrid was reported for highly efficient combined gene silencing and chemodynamic therapy. The system can effectively co&#8208;deliver DNAzyme and Cu2+ into cancer cells for dual&#8208;catalytic therapy to fight against tumors, thus providing an intelligent self&#8208;driven strategy for smart theranostics.







Abstract
Despite the great efforts of using DNAzyme for gene therapy, its clinical success is limited by the lack of simple delivery systems and limited anticancer efficacy. Here, we develop a simple approach for the synthesis of hybrid nanostructures that exclusively consist of DNAzyme and Cu2+ with ultra&#8208;high loading capacity. The Cu&#8211;DNAzyme nanohybrids allow to effectively co&#8208;deliver DNAzyme and Cu2+ into cancer cells for combinational catalytic therapy. The released Cu2+ can be reduced to Cu+ by glutathione and then catalyze endogenous H2O2 to form cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), while the 10&#8211;23 DNAzyme enables the catalytic cleavage of VEGFR2 mRNA and activates gene silencing for gene therapy. We demonstrate that the system can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity. Our work paves an extremely simple way to integrate DNAzyme with CDT for the dual&#8208;catalytic tumor treatment.

         <title>Engineering of a Peptide &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Methyltransferase to Methylate Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14319-14323, June 21, 2021. </description>

Peptide backbone methylation is a highly desired modification. Using split intein, synthetic peptides and an engineered variant of the methylase, fOphMA2, it was possible to enzymatically methylate amide bonds involving non&#8208;natural amino acids. This has application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.







Abstract
Introduction of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methylated non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids into peptides can improve their biological activities, membrane permeability and proteolytic stability. This is commonly achieved, in nature and in the lab, by assembling pre&#8208;methylated amino acids. The more appealing route of methylating amide bonds is challenging. Biology has evolved an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;automethylating enzyme, OphMA, which acts on the amide bonds of peptides fused to its C&#8208;terminus. Due to the ribosomal biosynthesis of its substrate, the activity of this enzyme towards peptides with non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids has not been addressed. An engineered OphMA, intein&#8208;mediated protein ligation and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis have allowed us to demonstrate the methylation of amide bonds in the context of non&#8208;natural amides. This approach may have application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.

         <title>Effect of External Surface Diffusion Barriers on Platinum/Beta&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of n&#8208;Pentane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14394-14398, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
External surface diffusion barriers on zeolite Beta crystals significantly reduce their apparent catalytic activity in catalyzing isomerization of n&#8208;pentane. Eliminating surface barriers can lead to an improvement in apparent catalytic activity higher than 131&#8201;%.







Abstract
We have developed a generalizable strategy to quantify the effect of surface barriers on zeolite catalysis. Isomerization of n&#8208;pentane, catalyzed by Pt/Beta, is taken as a model reaction system. Firstly, the surface modification by chemical liquid deposition of SiO2 was carried out to control the surface barriers on zeolite Beta crystals. The deposition of SiO2 leads to a very slight change in the physical properties of Beta crystals, but an obvious reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Diffusion measurements by the zero&#8208;length column (ZLC) method show that the apparent diffusivity of n&#8208;pentane can be more than doubled after SiO2 deposition, indicating that the surface barriers have been weakened. Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor, showing that the apparent catalytic activity improved by 51&#8211;131&#8201;% after SiO2 deposition. These results provide direct proof that reducing surface barriers can be an effective route to improve zeolite catalyst performance deteriorated by transport limitations.

         <title>Bioinspired Color Switchable Photonic Crystal Silicone Elastomer Kirigami</title>

The color of photonic crystal&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane kirigami sheets (PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami) can be switched mechanically. The material offers programmable structural color, which is retained after recycling &gt;10&#8201;000 times. The visibility of PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami is high&#8212;even in bright sunlight&#8212;and technical flexibility and mechanical durability are achieved.







Abstract
Bioinspired dynamic structural color has great potential for use in dynamic displays, sensors, cryptography, and camouflage. However, it is quite rare for artificial structural color devices to withstand thousands of cycles. Male hummingbird's crowns and gorgets are brightly colored, demonstrating frequent color switching that is induced by regulating the orientation of the feathers through movement of skin or joints. Inspired by this unique structural color modulation, we demonstrate a flexible, mechanically triggered color switchable sheet based on a photonic crystal (PhC)&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) kirigami (PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami) made by laser cutting. Finite element modeling (FEM) simulation reveals that the thickness of PDMS kirigami and the chamfer at the incision induced by laser cutting both dominate the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformation through in&#8208;plane stretching. The bioinspired PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami shows precisely programmable structural color and keeps the color very well after recycling over 10&#8201;000 times. This bioinspired PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami also shows excellent viewability even in bright sunlight, high readability, robust functionality, technical flexibility, and mechanical durability, which are readily exploitable for applications, such as chromic mechanical monitors for the sports industry or for medical applications, wearable camouflage, and security systems.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electric Directional Anisotropy in Polar Soft Ferromagnets of Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14350-14354, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation in two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) is demonstrated with a polar soft ferromagnetic system for the first time. The polarity of 2D&#8208;OIHPs is found in the nonmagnetic organic layers and also in the magnetic inorganic layers, where the ME response should be induced. Reflecting the soft magnetic nature, the ME&#8208;response is achieved by a low magnetic field.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) are attracting interest due to their structural tunability and rich functional characteristics, such as ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. Here, we report the chiral&#8208;polar ferromagnetic 2D&#8208;OIHP copper chlorides with discernable electric polarization in the inorganic layers. In these systems, the magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation has been clearly observed by measuring a magneto&#8208;electric directional anisotropy (MEA), in which an optical absorption coefficient changes with reversal of the light propagating direction. We have found that the MEA can be induced by a low magnetic field of about 50&#8197;mT, reflecting soft magnetic nature. The present results suggest a new paradigm for designing functional ME multiferroics, which effectively couples magnetic and electric properties.

&lt;p&gt;Magneto-electric (ME) correlation in two-dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-OIHPs) is demonstrated with a polar soft ferromagnetic system for the first time. The polarity of 2D-OIHPs is found in the nonmagnetic organic layers and also in the magnetic inorganic layers, where the ME response should be induced. Reflecting the soft magnetic nature, the ME-response is achieved by a low magnetic field.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Production of Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam Chemicals from Biomass&#8208;Derived Triacetic Acid Lactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14405-14409, June 21, 2021. </description>

A novel tandem catalytic route was developed for the selective production of 2&#8208;methyl piperidine (MP) or 6&#8208;methylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (MPO) from biomass&#8208;derived triacetic acid lactone (TAL), which opens the way for efficient production of piperidine and &#948;&#8208;lactam chemicals from renewable biomass.







Abstract
Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam chemicals have wide application, which are currently produced from fossil resource in industry. Production of this kind of chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass is of great importance, but is challenging and the reported routes give low yield. Herein, we demonstrate the strategy to synthesize 2&#8208;methyl piperidine (MP) and 6&#8208;methylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (MPO) from biomass&#8208;derived triacetic acid lactone (TAL) that is produced microbially from glucose. In this route, TAL was firstly converted into 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (HMPO) through facile aminolysis, subsequently HMPO was selectively transformed into MP or MPO over Ru catalysts supported on beta zeolite (Ru/BEA&#8208;X, X is the molar ratio of Si to Al) via the tandem reaction. It was found that the yield of MP could reach 76.5&#8201;% over Ru/BEA&#8208;60 in t&#8208;BuOH, and the yield of MPO could be 78.5&#8201;% in dioxane. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent catalytic performance of Ru/BEA&#8208;60 was closely correlated with the cooperative effects between active metal and acidic zeolite with large pore geometries. The related reaction pathway was studied on the basis of control experiments.

1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. The radical cascade features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved as well as 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethoxy carbonyl protected &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;oxy acids are used as amidyl radical precursors. anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of the amidyl radical to the alkene and Ni&#8208;mediated radical/transition metal cross over lead to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation product. The radical cascade, which can be conducted under practical and mild conditions, features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved using a L&#8208;(+)&#8208;lactic acid derived vinyl ether as the substrate, offering a novel route for the preparation of protected enantiopure &#945;&#8208;arylated &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. In addition, 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers is achieved by using an acyl succinimide as the electrophile for the Ni&#8208;mediated radical coupling.

         <title>Introduction of Photolatent Bases for Locally Controlling Dynamic Exchange Reactions in Thermo&#8208;Activated Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14302-14306, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vitrimers are covalently crosslinked polymers capable of rearranging their network topology through thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions. However, a locally controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions at elevated temperatures is a major challenge. A fundamental concept is demonstrated that enables controlled and, moreover, spatially resolved topology rearrangements triggerable by UV irradiation.







Abstract
Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure, as is characteristic of classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serious lack of methods that enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above Tv. Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8211;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network's Tv, only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterification in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.

         <title>Spatial Confinement Tunes Cleavage and Re&#8208;Formation of C=N Bonds in Fluorescent Molecules</title>

Spatial confinement dramatically changes the pathway and energy profile of chemical reactions. Confinement effect promoted increased local concentration and reduced steric hindrance of reactive groups, which realized the reversible conversion of molecular fluorescence. This fluorescence switching system has potential applications in information encryption and multi&#8208;informational display.







Abstract
Molecules in confined spaces exhibit unusual behaviors that are not typically observed in bulk systems. Such behavior can provide alternative strategies for exploring new reaction pathways. Cleavage of the C=N bond of Nile red (NR) in solution is an irreversible reaction. Here, we used spatial confinement within a cationic micelle&#8208;confined system to convert this reaction to a reversible process. The fluorescence of NR shifted between red and green for nine cycles. The new chemical pathway based on spatial confinement can be attributed to two factors: increasing the local concentration of reactants and reducing the reaction energy barrier. This effect is supported by both experimental evidence and theoretical calculations. The cross&#8208;linked silica shell comprising the confinement chamber stabilizes the enclosed molecules. This reduces fluorophore leakage and maintains fluorescence intensity in most environments, including in solution, on paper, and in hydrogel films, and expands practical applications in encrypted information and multi&#8208;informational displays.

A generation of sodium metal free, hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor in a continuous flow set&#8208;up was reported. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium proved to be a very useful sodium organometallic reagent and was used for in&#8208;line sodiations as well as Br/Na&#8208;exchange reactions. The arylsodiums were trapped with various electrophiles. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was reported.







Abstract
We report the on&#8208;demand generation of hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (1) from 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)heptane (2) using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Thus, the resulting solution of 1 is free of elemental sodium and therefore suited for a range of synthetic applications. This new procedure avoids the storage of an alkylsodium and limits the handling of metallic sodium to a minimum. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (1) proved to be a very useful reagent and undergoes in&#8208;line Br/Na&#8208;exchanges as well as directed sodiations. The resulting arylsodium intermediates are subsequently trapped in batch with various electrophiles such as ketones, aldehydes, Weinreb&#8208;amides, imines, allyl bromides, disulfides and alkyl iodides. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was also reported.

         <title>Synthesis, Electronic Structure, and Reactivity of a Planar Four&#8208;Coordinate, Cobalt&#8211;Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14376-14380, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;coordinate, planar cobalt&#8211;imido compound was isolated and characterized. Integrated experimental and computational studies identified radical character on the iminyl nitrogen accounting for a reduction in overall bond order. Upon thermolysis, the complex underwent selective P&#8211;N coupling with the desymmetrized pincer. Transition state analysis revealed that thermodynamic control is the origin of the observed selectivity.







Abstract
A four&#8208;coordinate cobalt&#8211;imido complex, (tBumPNP)Co=NMes (tBumPNP=modified PNP pincer ligand) has been synthesized from addition of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenylazide (Mes&#8211;N3) to the corresponding dinitrogen complex. The solid&#8208;state structure determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction established a rare, idealized planar geometry with a Co=N bond distance of 1.716(2)&#8197;&#197;. Magnetic measurements revealed an S=1 ground state with CAS&#8208;SCF calculations supporting radical character on the imide nitrogen. Thermolysis of the cobalt&#8211;imido compound induced selective insertion of the imido group into a Co&#8722;P bond and yielded a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt complex with a distorted T&#8208;shaped geometry. Transition state analysis conducted with DFT calculations established the thermodynamic stability of the P&#8211;N coupled product and provided insight into the exclusive selectivity.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Alkene Hydromethylation via Protonolysis of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14360-14364, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the direct Markovnikov hydromethylation of unactivated alkenes by protonolysis of titanacyclobutanes has been developed. This approach enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a methyl group into complex, polyfunctional molecules and has been demonstrated with a series of mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.







Abstract
Methyl groups are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules. Thus, new tactics to introduce this alkyl fragment into polyfunctional structures are of significant interest. With this goal in mind, a direct method for the Markovnikov hydromethylation of alkenes is reported. This method exploits the degenerate metathesis reaction between the titanium methylidene unveiled from Cp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#956;&#8208;CH2)AlMe2 (Tebbe's reagent) and unactivated alkenes. Protonolysis of the resulting titanacyclobutanes in&#8197;situ effects hydromethylation in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and site&#8208;selective manner. The broad utility of this method is demonstrated across a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade to Benzoxepins by Using Vinyl&#8208;Substituted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14410-14414, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomerically enriched benzoxepins were synthesized from phosphonate&#8208;functionalized vinylcyclopropanes and salicylaldehydes by palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring opening followed by Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons olefination and subsequent O&#8208;allylation (see scheme). In contrast to existing cycloaddition reactions of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes, the two bonds are each formed in a separate event, thus allowing greater flexibility in reaction design.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cascade (4+3) cyclocondensation of salicylaldehydes and vinylcyclopropanes is reported. A key feature of the reaction is the use of a phosphonate group as an acceptor moiety on the cyclopropane, exploiting its propensity to undergo olefination with aldehydes. Subsequent O&#8208;allylation enabled the formation of a range of substituted benzoxepinsWith a novel chiral ligand, the products were obtained in generally good yield and with reasonable enantioselectivity.

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOF&#8208;808 Achieved by Controlling the Binding Mode of Grafted Sulfamate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14334-14338, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity in a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by modulating the binding mode of sulfamate&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 to produce the more acidic cationic sulfiliminium group (&#8722;S=NH2+), which results in more efficient proton conduction.







Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having superprotonic conductivity, MOF&#8208;808, is prepared by modulating the binding mode of the sulfamate (SA) moieties grafted onto the metal clusters. The activation of the SA&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 at 150&#8201;&#176;C changes the binding mode of the grafted SA from monodentate to bridging bidentate, thus converting the neutral amido (&#8208;S&#8722;NH2) moiety of the grafted SA to the more acidic cationic sulfiliminium (&#8208;S=NH2+) moiety. Further, the acidic sulfiliminium moiety of MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;150 results in more efficient proton conduction than the amido moiety of MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;60. At 60&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity, MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;150 is found to have a proton conductivity of 7.89&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is more than 30&#8208;times higher than that of MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;60. Moreover, this superprotonic conductivity is well maintained over 1000&#8197;cycles of conductivity measurements and for similar cyclic measurements each day for seven days.

The activation of the SA-grafted MOF-808 at 150&#8201;&#176;C changes the binding mode of the grafted SA from monodentate to bridging bidentate, thus converting the neutral amido (-S&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moiety of the grafted SA to the more acidic cationic sulfiliminium (-S=NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) moiety. Further, the acidic sulfiliminium moiety of MOF-808-4SA-150 results in more efficient proton conduction than the amido moiety of MOF-808-4SA-60. At 60&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity, MOF-808-4SA-150 is found to have a proton conductivity of 7.89&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is more than 30-times higher than that of MOF-808-4SA-60. Moreover, this superprotonic conductivity is well maintained over 1000&#8197;cycles of conductivity measurements and for similar cyclic measurements each day for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Supramolecular Complex of C60&#8211;S with High&#8208;Density Active Sites as a Cathode for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14313-14318, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) was synthesized as a cathode material for Li&#8211;S batteries by a simple one&#8208;step process. All C60 molecules in the complex provide active sites to adsorb LiPSs (see picture). Under practical conditions with a high S loading and a low electrolyte/S ratio, a Li&#8211;S battery delivered a high capacity of 809&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
The well&#8208;known &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and low sulfur utilization hinder the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, we describe a novel C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for LiPS adsorption that was formed by a simple one&#8208;step process as a cathode material for Li&#8211;S batteries. Benefiting from the cocrystal structure, 100&#8201;% of the C60 molecules in the complex can offer active sites to adsorb LiPSs and catalyze their conversion. Furthermore, the lithiated C60 cores promote internal ion transport inside the composite cathode. At a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, the C60&#8211;S cathode with a sulfur loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibited a high capacity of 809&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The development of the C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex will inspire the invention of a new family of S/fullerenes as cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and extend the application of fullerenes.

         <title>Titanocene&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2] Cycloaddition of Bisenones and Comparison with Photoredox Catalysis and Established Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14339-14344, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For [2+2] cycloaddition reactions of bisenones, higher yields and diastereoselectivities as well as greater substrate scope were observed under catalysis by Cp2Ti(TFA) than with previously established methods (see scheme). The mechanism is characterized by a highly unusual combination of an unfavorable and rate&#8208;determining 5&#8208;exo and favorable 4&#8208;exo cyclization, as established by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Cp2Ti(TFA) is a broadly applicable catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenones by inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer. The attractiveness of this mechanism is shown by comparison with outer&#8208;sphere ET methods. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a unique unfavorable 5&#8208;exo (the rate&#8208;determining step) and a favorable 4&#8208;exo cyclization.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products over a Copper&#8208;Copper Iodide Catalyst</title>

A Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE, substantially higher than Cu or CuI alone. It is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon hydrocarbon and oxygenate (C2+) products with high energy density and wide availability is of great importance, as it provides a promising way to achieve the renewable energy storage and close the carbon cycle. Herein we design a Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst with abundant Cu0/Cu+ interfaces by physically mixing Cu nanoparticles and CuI powders. The composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell, substantially higher than Cu (329&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and CuI (96&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) counterparts. Induced by alkaline electrolyte and applied potential, the Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst undergoes significant reconstruction under CO2RR conditions. The high&#8208;rate C2+ production over Cu&#8208;CuI is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Heterometallic Coinage Metal Acetylenediide Clusters Showing Tailored Thermochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14381-14384, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of heterometallic coinage metal acetylenediide clusters (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgM6 (M=Ag/Cu) were prepared via a heterometallic precursor approach. They are isostructural but display different thermochromic luminescence. The replacement of silver with copper changes the HOMO character to induce dual&#8208;emission in (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgCu6, and this dual&#8208;emission is associated from two emissive states favored at different temperatures.







Abstract
Acetelyenediide (C22&#8722;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)6Ag7(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (2) and [(AuL)6AgCu6(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (3), L=phenylbis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy2). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in 2 are replaced with copper in 3. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;AuL)M2Ag (M=Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu&#8208;doping significantly increases the energy level of (C2&#8208;Cu)&#8208;involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual&#8208;emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi&#8208;congeneric metal components.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and [(AuL)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;AgCu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), L=phenylbis(2-pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are replaced with copper in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu-C&#8801;C-AuL)M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag (M=Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu-doping significantly increases the energy level of (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu)-involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual-emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi-congeneric metal components.&lt;/p&gt;

The first all&#8208;amidinate&#8208;supported gold nanocluster Au28 has been synthesized and structurally resolved. This cluster is quite robust manifested by the fact that it can stay intact in solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;d and maintain high FE(CO)s and activity over 40&#8197;hour operation for electroreduction of CO2. The strong gold&#8211;ligand binding and geometric closure account for the superior stability of Au28.







Abstract
The first all&#8208;amidinate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster [Au28(Ph&#8722;form)12](OTf)2 (Ph&#8208;form=N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate) (Au28) has been synthesized and structurally resolved. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that Au28 has a compact Au4@Au24 tetrahedral core&#8211;shell structure of T symmetry, which is fully protected by 12 bridging formamidinate ligands. This cluster is quite robust as indicated by the fact that it can stay intact in solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;d. It exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the electroreduction of CO2 with 96.5&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.57&#8197;V and a maximum TOF of 1731&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.87&#8197;V. Its superior stability is also manifested in the fact that the supported catalyst Au28/CNTs maintains stable potentials at ca. &#8722;0.69&#8197;V for 40&#8197;h with FE(CO)s&gt;91&#8201;%. A superatomic electron configuration of 1S21P62S21D4 has been clarified by DFT computations, and the strong gold&#8211;ligand binding and geometric shell closure account for the superior stability of Au28.

         <title>Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Anion Coinage Bonds: The Case of Tetrachloridoaurate</title>

The gold atom of the AuCl4&#8722; moiety forms attractive anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion and anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;neutral electron&#8211;donor interactions. These interactions are rationalized as &#960;&#8208;hole coinage bonds and give rise to robust and reliable supramolecular synthons which control recognition and organization phenomena in the solid state. Hence, they might be considered for tuning structural and functional features in materials and biosystems.







Abstract
Interactions in crystalline tetrachloridoaurates of acetylcholine and dimethylpropiothetine are characterized by Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl and Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O short contacts. The former interactions assemble the AuCl4&#8722; units into supramolecular anionic polymers, while the latter interactions append the acetylcholine and propiothetine units to the polymer. The distorted octahedral geometry of the bonding pattern around the gold center is rationalized on the basis of the anisotropic distribution of the electron density, which enables gold to behave as an electrophile (&#960;&#8208;hole coinage&#8208;bond donor). Computational studies prove that gold atoms in negatively charged species can function as acceptors of electron density. The attractive nature of the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl/O interactions described here complement the known aurophilic bonds involved in gold&#8208;centered interactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclization for the Synthesis of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14355-14359, June 21, 2021. </description>

The quinazolinone motif is an important feature in natural products and drug candidates although enantioselective approaches to such scaffolds remain rare. An enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization delivers pyrroloquinazolines, featuring quaternary stereocenters and synthetic handles for further derivatization, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Quinazolinones are common substructures in molecules of medicinal importance. We report an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization for the assembly of privileged pyrroloquinazolinone motifs. The reaction proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, and can deliver products containing quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the products is demonstrated through further manipulations.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Supported Atomically Dispersed Gold Catalysts for Efficient Fenton&#8208;like Reaction</title>

A substituted solid solution was used to achieve self&#8208;exfoliation of synthetic materials and optimize electronic metal&#8211;carrier interactions to increase the material's high efficiency and stable water treatment catalytic performance.







Abstract
The atomically dispersed metal is expected as one of the most promising Fenton&#8208;like catalysts for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants (ROPs) by the strong &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support interactions&#8221; (EMSIs). Here, we develop an atomically dispersed metal&#8211;atom alloy made by guest Au atoms substitute host V atoms in the two&#8208;dimensional VO2(B) nanobelt support (Au/VO2) to activate Fenton&#8208;like oxidation for elimination of ROPs. The 2D nanobelt structure enlarges the exposure of atomically Au thus increasing the number of active sites to absorb more S2O82&#8722; ions. And the EMSIs regulate the charge density in Au atoms to present positive charge Au+, lowering the energy barrier of S2O82&#8722; decomposition to produce SO4.&#8722;. The Au/VO2 catalyst possesses excellent durable and reliable characteristics and exhibits record&#8208;breaking efficiency with TOF as high as 21.42&#8197;min&#8722;1, 16.19&#8197;min&#8722;1, and 80.89&#8197;min&#8722;1 for rhodamine, phenol, and bisphenol&#8197;A degradation, respectively.

         <title>Cluster From Cluster: A Quantitative Approach to Magic Gold Nanoclusters [Au25(SR)18]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 26, Page 14415-14419, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cluster from cluster&#8221; approach was developed to assemble gold nanoclusters via preformed atomically precise Au13 precursors. This facile approach has attractive advantages: very high overall yield (&#8776;100&#8201;%), large scale (gram&#8208;scale) and generally applicable in the synthesis of magic cluster Au25 (10 examples).







Abstract
High&#8208;yield and large&#8208;scale synthesis are highly demanded for the studies of gold nanoclusters. We developed a &#8220;cluster from cluster&#8221; approach to assemble gold nanoclusters with preformed atomically precise Au13 precursors. This facile approach has proved to be very effective in the synthesis of the well&#8208;known magic cluster [Au25(SR)18]&#8722;, which could prepare the target cluster in high yield (overall yield up to &#8776;100&#8201;%) at large scale (gram&#8208;scale based on gold). This method can be applied in the synthesis of 10 Au25 clusters with different R groups. This work presents an important approach that may be extended to high&#8208;yield and large&#8208;scale synthesis of other metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Cyclobutanes: An Alternative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cleavage Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical activation of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes has been applied for the formal insertion of molecular oxygen into these compounds. C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage of the ring moieties was achieved either by direct anodic electrolysis or by utilizing a DDQ&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and supportive experiments provided mechanistic understanding of the electrocatalytic process.







Abstract
We describe the first electrochemical activation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes leading after C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage to the formation of highly reactive radical cations. This concept is utilized to formally insert molecular oxygen after direct or DDQ&#8208;assisted anodic oxidation of the strained carbocycles, delivering &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and 1,2&#8208;dioxanes electrocatalytically. Furthermore, insights into the mechanism of the oxidative process, obtained experimentally and by additional quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are presented. The synthetic potential of the reaction products is demonstrated by diverse derivatizations.

         <title>Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol on Mononuclear Copper(II) Sites Supported on Al2O3: Structure of Active Sites from Electron Paramagnetic Resonance**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;dispersed CuII sites generated on transition alumina using a molecular approach were employed in the stepwise partial oxidation of methane to methanol. The reactive CuII centers could be identified spectroscopically due to their unique EPR signature. A structure for these unusual CuII monomers, working in pairs, was proposed based on advanced spectroscopic characterization, reactivity studies, and DFT modeling.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to methanol remains one of the holy grails of chemistry, where Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites have been shown promote this reaction under stepwise conditions. Over the years, several active sites have been proposed, ranging from mono&#8208;, di&#8208; to trimeric CuII. Herein, we report the formation of well&#8208;dispersed monomeric CuII species supported on alumina using surface organometallic chemistry and their reactivity towards the selective and stepwise conversion of methane to methanol. Extensive studies using various transition alumina supports combined with spectroscopic characterization, in particular electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), show that the active sites are associated with specific facets, which are typically found in &#947;&#8208; and &#951;&#8208;alumina phase, and that their EPR signature can be attributed to species having a tri&#8208;coordinated [(Al2O)CuIIO(OH)]&#8722; T&#8208;shape geometry. Overall, the selective conversion of methane to methanol, a two&#8208;electron process, involves two monomeric CuII sites that play in concert.

         <title>Real&#8208;time NMR monitoring of spatially segregated enzymatic reactions in multilayered hydrogel assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalized chemical reactions at the microscale are important in biotechnology, yet monitoring the molecular content at these small scales is challenging. To address this challenge, we integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the operation of this system by monitoring the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. As a benchmark, we observed the parallel activities of urease (Urs), catalase (Cat), and glucose oxidase (GOx) by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time. Simultaneous monitoring of an independent enzymatic process (Urs) together with a cooperative process (GOx + Cat) was achieved, with chemical conversion modulation of the GOx + Cat process demonstrated by varying the order in which the hydrogel was assembled. Construction of complex reaction cascades with spatial control is thereby enabled, as would be interesting in, for example, metabolic engineering and multiplexed sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Azide&#8211;Thioalkyne Cycloaddition Catalyzed by Photoactivatable Ruthenium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored cationic RuII complexes are highly effective precatalysts for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (see scheme). These reactions can now be carried out under very dilute conditions and in complex biorelevant media; they are also compatible with and mutually orthogonal to CuAAC. Moreover, ruthenium&#8211;arene sandwich complexes function as photoactivatable precatalysts, providing for temporal control of the reactivity.







Abstract
Tailored ruthenium sandwich complexes bearing photoresponsive arene ligands can efficiently promote azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (RuAtAC) when irradiated with UV light. The reactions can be performed in a bioorthogonal manner in aqueous mixtures containing biological components. The strategy can also be applied for the selective modification of biopolymers, such as DNA or peptides. Importantly, this ruthenium&#8208;based technology and the standard copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) proved to be compatible and mutually orthogonal.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral S&#8208;nitrosation Mediated by a Dicopper Center</title>

         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.







Abstract
A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO. and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)2]2+ or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)]2+, which readily release RSNO in 88&#8211;94&#8201;% yield. The S&#8208;nitrosation proceeds by a mixed&#8208;valence [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic &#956;&#8208;O site and nitrosates RS&#8722; at the &#956;&#8208;NO site. The [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ complex is also competent for O&#8208;nitrosation of MeOH. A rare [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(OMe)]2+ intermediate was isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the S&#8208;nitrosation may proceed through the intermediary of analogous [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(SR)]2+ species. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.

         <title>Tricyanidoferrates(&#8722;IV) and Ruthenates(&#8722;IV) with Non&#8208;Innocent Cyanido Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;rich cyanidometalates [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; represent the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with an oxidation state of &#8722;IV. DFT calculations reveal a nominal d10s0 configuration, which corresponds to an effective charge of 2&#8722;. The high negative charge also weakens the C&#8722;N bonds by the population of antibonding states.







Abstract
Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and AE3.5[M(CN)3] (AE=Sr, Ba; M=Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8722;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in P63/m, the polar space group P63 with three&#8208;fold cell volume for AE3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation. X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy reveal longer C&#8722;N distances (124&#8211;128&#8197;pm) and much lower stretching frequencies (1484&#8211;1634&#8197;cm&#8722;1) than in classical cyanidometalates. Weak C&#8722;N bonds in combination with strong M&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonding is a scheme also known for carbonylmetalates. Instead of the formal notation [Fe&#8722;IV(CN&#8722;)3]7&#8722;, quantum chemical calculations reveal non&#8208;innocent intermediate&#8208;valent CN1.67&#8722; ligands and a closed&#8208;shell d10 configuration for Fe, that is, Fe2&#8722;.

         <title>Stable Acidic Water Oxidation with a Cobalt&#8211;Iron&#8211;Lead Oxide Catalyst Operating via a Cobalt&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Healing Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox water oxidation anode catalyst facilitates long&#8208;term O2 evolution reaction in acidic electrolytes at elevated temperatures. Through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism, this catalyst operates in the absence of dissolved Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors deeming it a prospective anode material for low&#8208;cost water electrolyzer systems.







Abstract
The instability and expense of anodes for water electrolyzers with acidic electrolytes can be overcome through the implementation of a cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide electrocatalyst, [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox, that is self&#8208;healing in the presence of dissolved metal precursors. However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half&#8208;reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum H2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox in acidic solutions through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80&#177;1&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56&#177;0.01&#8197;V on a one&#8208;week timescale.

         <title>A Bubble&#8208;Assisted Approach for Patterning Nanoscale Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams has been developed, and this approach can achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm currently. Using a kind of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin, we elucidate the hierarchal assembly structure and molecular interactions in bubble system.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams, and achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm. The bubble&#8208;assisted assembly (BAA) process is consisted of two periods, including bubble evolution and molecular assembly, which are dominated by the Laplace pressure and molecular interactions, respectively. Using TPPS (meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin), we systematically investigate the patterns and assembly behaviour in the bubble system with a series of characterizations, which show good uniformity in nanoscale resolution. Theoretical simulations reveal that TPPS's J&#8208;aggregates contribute to the ordered construction of molecular patterns. Finally, we propose an empirical rule for molecular patterning approach, that the surfactant and functional molecules should have the same type of charge in a two&#8208;component system. This approach exhibits promising feasibility to assemble molecular patterns at nanoscale resolution for micro/nano functional devices.

         <title>A Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;Tenon Joint Inspired Mechanically Interlocked Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that the delicate mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint was precisely mimicked to construct a mechanically interlocked network (MIN), which simultaneously integrates incompatible mechanical adaptivity, robustness, and dynamic stability in a single system.







Abstract
Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joints have been widely used for thousands of years in wooden architectures in virtue of their artistic and functional performance. However, imitation of similar structural and mechanical design philosophy to construct mechanically adaptive materials at the molecular level is a challenge. Herein, we report a mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint inspired mechanically interlocked network (MIN), in which the [2]rotaxane crosslink not only mimics the joint in structure, but also reproduces its function in modifying mechanical properties of the MIN. Benefiting from the hierarchical energy dissipative ability along with the controllable intramolecular movement of the mechanically interlocked crosslink, the resultant MIN simultaneously exhibits notable mechanical adaptivity and structural stability in a single system, as manifested by decent stiffness, strength, toughness, and deformation recovery capacity.

         <title>A Distannylated Monomer of a Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is readily synthesized and used to develop acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels and can be effectively n&#8208;doped, and thus lead to excellent thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
Acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8722;4.4&#8197;eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 24.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.

         <title>Isomeric Dibenzoheptazethrenes for Air&#8208;Stable Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dibenzoheptazethrene isomers with low diradical character, large singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, and narrow energy gaps were synthesized. Both compounds exhibited remarkably high stability, which allowed for the fabrication of single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors in air. A hole mobility of up to 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was obtained with good bias&#8208;stress and storage stability.







Abstract
Singlet diradicaloids hold great potential as semiconductors for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, their relative low material and device stabilities impede the practical applications. Here, to achieve balanced stability and performance, two isomeric dibenzoheptazethrene derivatives with singlet diradical character were synthesized in a concise manner. Benefitting from the aromatic stabilization, both compounds display a small diradical character and large singlet&#8211;triplet gap, as corroborated by variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, single&#8208;crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations. OFET devices based on single crystals showed a high hole mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest for zethrene&#8208;based semiconductors. Both isomers exhibited remarkable material stability in air&#8208;saturated solutions as well as excellent bias&#8208;stress and storage stability in device under ambient air.

         <title>Rational Design of a Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, we show that a carbamate as recognition unit has an excellent selectivity for a hepatocellular carcinoma chemotherapy (HCC)&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) without interference from other hydrolases. We developed a near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe with high selectivity and strong fluorescence signals towards CE activity, enabling it to successfully monitor CE activity for evaluating HCC chemotherapy in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarkers in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward the HCC&#8208;related biomarker carboxylesterase (CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. The in&#8197;vivo signals of the probe correlate well with tumor apoptosis, making it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. The probe enables the imaging of CE activity in&#8197;situ with a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional view for the first time. This study may promote advances in optical imaging approaches for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in&#8197;situ and its evaluation of treatment.

         <title>An All&#8208;in&#8208;One Organic Semiconductor for Targeted Photoxidation Catalysis in Hypoxic Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale organic semiconductor C5N2 NPs were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot bottom&#8208;up method. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one semiconductor, with a low band gap of 1.63&#8197;eV and inherent nucleus targeting and strong photooxidation capacity, could accumulate at cell nucleus, split H2O to produce O2 and also generate cytotoxia 1O2 under high&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable NIR irradiation, successfully achieving effective and enhanced PDT in a hypoxic tumor.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia severely limits the therapeutic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Although many methods for oxygen generation exist, substantial safety concerns, spatiotenporal uncontrollability, limited efficacy, and complicated procedures have compromised their practical application. Here, we demonstrate a biocompatiable all&#8208;in&#8208;one organic semiconductor to provide a photoxidation catalysis mechanism of action. A facile method is developed to produce gram&#8208;level C5N2 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based organic semiconductor. Under 650&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the semiconductor split water to generate O2 and simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), showing that the photocatalyst for O2 evolution and the photosensitizer (PS) for 1O2 generation could be synchronously achieved in one organic semiconductor. The inherent nucleus targeting capacity endows it with direct and efficient DNA photocleavage. These findings pave the way for developing organic semiconductor&#8208;based cancer therapeutic agents.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a Ruthenium&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Mobile Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was applied as the first ruthenium&#8208;based mobile catalyst to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. The RuII catalyst was discovered to interact with both CO2 molecules and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting CO2RR and delaying carbonate formation and consequently leading to lowered overpotential, enlarged capacity, and prolonged cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical devices. However, the greatest challenge arises from the formation of the discharge product, Li2CO3, which would accumulate and deactivate heterogenous catalysts to cause huge polarization. Herein, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was employed as a solution&#8208;phase catalyst for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries and proved to be the most effective one screened so far. Spectroscopy and electrochemical analyses elucidate that the RuII center could interact with both CO2 and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting electroreduction process and delaying carbonate transformation. As a result, the charge potential is reduced to 3.86&#8197;V and over 60 discharge/charge cycles are achieved with a fixed capacity of 1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work provides a new avenue to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with efficient mobile catalysts.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Resolved Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Reveals Dynamic CO Intermediates during Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) reveals the dynamics of the CO2 reduction reaction over Cu surfaces with a sub&#8208;second time resolution of 717&#8197;ms per spectrum. Anodic treatment and subsequent reduction result in a highly active surface for both SERS and ethylene production within 7&#8197;s. A dynamic CO intermediate below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1 correlates with CO&#8208;CO coupling and ethylene formation, and a static CO intermediate with a vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1 relates to CO production.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) into hydrocarbons is a promising approach for greenhouse gas mitigation, but many details of this dynamic reaction remain elusive. Here, time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) is employed to successfully monitor the dynamics of CO2RR intermediates and Cu surfaces with sub&#8208;second time resolution. Anodic treatment at 1.55&#8197;V vs. RHE and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hotspots for TR&#8208;SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to &#8776;0.7&#8197;s) and fourfold improved CO2RR efficiency toward ethylene. With TR&#8208;SERS, the initial restructuring of the Cu surface was followed (&lt;7&#8197;s), after which a stable surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1, is related to C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Formulating the Electrolyte Towards High&#8208;Energy and Safe Rechargeable Lithium&#8211;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formulation of conventional electrolyte composition yields a hybrid solid/liquid electrolyte that is electrochemically compatible with the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, which promises stable operation of a practical 10&#8208;Ah&#8208;grade pouch cell with a specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8211;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 are highly desired for next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8211;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. We demonstrate that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li&#8741;LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8197;Ah Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell demonstrates a practical specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our findings shed light on reasonable design principles for electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interfaces toward practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.

         <title>A Synthetic Galectin Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic galectin mimic was designed, synthesized, and shown to bind selectively to n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
Galectins are a galactoside specific subclass of carbohydrate binding proteins (lectins) involved in various cellular activities, certain cancers, infections, inflammations, and many other biological processes. The molecular basis for the selectivity of galectins is well&#8208;documented and revolves around appropriate interaction complementarity: an aromatic residue for C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and polar residues for (charge assisted) hydrogen bonds with the axial hydroxyl group of a galactoside. However, no synthetic mimics are currently available. We now report on the design and synthesis of the first galectin mimic (6), and show that it has a higher than 65&#8208;fold preference for n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galactoside (8) over n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside (7) in CD2Cl2 containing 5&#8201;% [D6]DMSO (with Ka&#8805;4500&#8197;M&#8722;1 for 6:8). Molecular modeling informed by nOe studies reveal a high degree of interaction complementarity between 6 and galactoside 8, which is very similar to the interaction complementarity found in natural galectins.

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motorized macrocycles have been successfully synthesized by combining molecular motors with crown ether macrocycles, enabling a unique photo&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems controlled by the multi&#8208;stable unidirectional rotation of molecular motors. The switchable chiral cavity can be also used for the enantioselective recognition of guests.







Abstract
Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. We designed photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. The octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8211;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems and dynamic materials.

         <title>Plastic Waste Conversion over a Refinery Waste Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the path to finding better catalysts for polyolefin plastic waste conversion to aromatics, we have found that a waste refinery catalyst performed better than the fresh catalyst with decreased accumulation of deactivating carbonaceous deposits. Fluorescence microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the interaction of the polymer with the catalyst and to map the location and type of bulky aromatic species.







Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) makes up a large share of our plastic waste. We investigated the conversion of PP over the industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking catalyst (FCC&#8208;cat) used to produce gasoline from crude oil fractions. We studied transport limitations arising from the larger size of polymers compared to the crude oil&#8208;based feedstock by testing the components of this catalyst separately. Infrared spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the role of the FCC matrix in aromatization, and the zeolite Y domains in coking. An equilibrium catalyst (ECAT), discarded during FCC operation as waste, produced the same aromatics content as a fresh FCC&#8208;cat, while coking decreased significantly, likely due to the reduced accessibility and activity of the zeolite domains and an enhanced cracking activity of the matrix due to metal deposits present in ECAT. This mechanistic understanding provides handles for further improving the catalyst composition towards higher aromatics selectivity.

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has drawn considerable interest since the discovery of its metal&#8208;free photocatalytic properties. The synthesis of a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN), azacalix[3]triazines, is reported. The material exhibits super strong basicity as well as anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has garnered broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possesses myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. We report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. We reveal the unique anion&#8208;&#960; interactions of AC3Ts that alters the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the usage scope and possibilities for GCNs.

Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium  tert  &#8208;butoxide was found to produce  N  &#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or  N  &#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of a purely covalent cage with homochirality via imine formation in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of host molecules in aqueous media via metal&#8208;ligand coordination is well developed. However, the preparation of purely covalent counterparts in water has remained a formidable task. Here, an anionic tetrahedron cage was successfully self&#8208;assembled in a [4+4] manner by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in water. Even although each individual imine bond is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze in water, the tetrahedron is remarkably stable or inert due to multivalence. The tetrahedral cages, as well as its neutral counterparts dissolved in organic solvent, have homochirality, namely that their four propeller&#8208;shaped trisformyl residues adopt the same rotational conformation. The cage is able to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of guest in water. When a chiral guest was recognized, the formation of one enantiomer of the cage becomes more favored relative to the other. As a consequence, the cage could be produced in an enantioselective manner. The tetrahedrons are able to maintain its chirality after removing the chiral guest, probably on account of the cooperative occurrence of intramolecular forces that restrict the intramolecular flipping of phenyl units in the cage framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulations of chiroptical properties in belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylenes via desymmetrization with heteroatom doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A desymmetrization strategy has been devised in the design of molecular cylinders to maximize the dissymmetry factor relevant to circularly polarized light. Although the highest dissymmetry factor of organic molecules was previously achieved with a chiral belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylene having magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in parallel, we noticed that an unbalanced magnitude of two moments was detrimental for higher dissymmetry factors. In this study, a molecular cylinder was desymmetrized by arraying doped and undoped panels via stereoselective cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization. The desymmetrization succeeded in balancing two moments by reducing the electric transition moment at the global minimum but failed to maximize the dissymmetry factor. Structural studies revealed that the dissymmetry factor is sensitive to subtle structural fluctuations, while the rotatory strength is not affected. This study is important for the development of chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissecting the Flash Chemistry of Electrogenerated Reactive Intermediates by Microdroplet Fusion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta&#8208;glass capillary.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta-glass capillary. The two individual microchannels of the theta-glass capillary are asymmetrically or symmetrically fabricated with a carbon bipolar electrode to produce intermediates  in situ  . Microdroplets containing the newly formed intermediates collide with those of the invoked reactants at sub-10 microsecond level, making it a powerful tool for exploring their ultrafast initial transformations. As a proof-of-concept, we present the identification of the key radical cation intermediate in the oxidative dimerization of 8-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline and also the first revealment of previously hidden nitrenium ion involved reaction pathway in the C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H cross-coupling between N,N&#8217;-dimethylaniline and phenothiazine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capture and Separation of SO2 Traces in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via Pre&#8208;synthetic Pore Environment Tailoring by Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO2 binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO2 adsorption and SO2/CO2 separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni2(BDC&#8208;X)2DABCO] (BDC&#8208;X = mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO2 affinity over the parent MOF. The SO2 separation potential by methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated breakthrough curves and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Reversible Semicrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous State Transitions of Stereoregular Azopolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over both the chirality and sequence of a synthetic polymer is critical for manipulating its material performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of a variety of isotactic azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) with main&#8208;chain chirality via highly enantioselective resolution copolymerization of  racemic  azobenzene&#8208;containing epoxides with cyclic anhydrides, using an enantiopure binuclear catalyst system. All the prepared polyesters bearing  trans  &#8208;azobenzene moieties were found to be typical semicrystalline materials with melting temperatures in the range of 153 to 231 &#176;C, while the corresponding isotactic  cis  &#8208;azopolyesters were amorphous. The azobenzene groups in the copolymers exhibited reversible  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  and  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  photoisomerization, upon irradiation with 365 and 450 nm light, respectively. These observations demonstrate that the crystallinity of isotactic azopolyesters can be manipulated via photoinduced reversible isomerization. In addition, mixing isotactic  trans  &#8208;polyesters with different enantiomeric configurations in a 1:1 mass ratio afforded crystalline stereocomplexes, for which the crystalline behaviors differed significantly from those of the component enantiomer. Also, photoinduced reversible transitions between semicrystalline and amorphous states were observed in various stereocomplexes of isotactic  trans  &#8208;azopolyesters, being similar to the isotactic azopolyesters themselves.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticle Sizes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the inherent performance limitations of intercalation&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state conversion batteries are promising systems for future energy storage. A high specific capacity and natural abundancy make iron disulfide (FeS  2  ) a promising cathode active material. In this work, FeS  2  &#160;nanoparticles were prepared solvothermally. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, samples with average particle diameters between 10&#160;nm and 35&#160;nm were synthesized. The electrochemical performance was evaluated in solid&#8208;state cells with a Li&#8209;argyrodite solid electrolyte. While the reduction of FeS  2  &#160;was found to be irreversible in the initial discharge, a stable cycling of the reduced species was observed subsequently. A positive effect of smaller particle dimensions on FeS  2  &#160;utilization was identified, which can be attributed to a higher interfacial contact area and shortened diffusion pathways inside the FeS  2  &#160;particles. These results highlight the general importance of morphological design to exploit the promising theoretical capacity of conversion electrodes in solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric&#160;Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent intramolecular interactions play an important role in the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene acceptors. Here, three nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5 and MQ6) are designed and synthesized by using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores which have one and two selenophene heterocycles, respectively. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#183;&#183;&#183;Se in comparison with that of O&#183;&#183;&#183;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport thereby leading to a higher power conversion ef&#64257;ciency (PCE) of 15.64% in comparison with MQ3 which shows a PCE of 13.51%. Additionally, based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows a further improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance which could be related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. Therefore, MQ6 exhibits an outstanding PCE of 16.39% with a  V  OC  of 0.88 V, a FF of 75.66% and a  J  SC  of 24.62 mA cm  &#8208;2  . These results suggest an important strategy to improve the performance of nonfullerene acceptors by using asymmetric&#160;cores with enhanced noncovalent intramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 13C&#8208;labels on repeating glycan oligomers to reveal protein binding epitopes through NMR: polylactosamine binding to Galectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis/NMR&#8208;based methodology is presented to identify, in unambiguous manner, the distinctive binding epitope within repeating sugar oligomers when binding to protein receptors. The concept is based on the incorporation of  13  C&#8208;labels at specific monosaccharide units, selected within a repeating glycan oligomeric structure. No new chemical tags are added, and thus the chemical entity remains the same, while the presence of the  13  C&#8208;labeled monosaccharide breaks the NMR chemical shift degeneracy that occurs in the non&#8208;labeled compound and allows the unique identification of the different components of the oligomer. The approach is demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study dealing with the interaction of a polylactosamine hexasaccharide with five different galectins that display distinct preferences for these entities.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis via Br&#248;nsted Acid Modulated Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Like Reaction in Carbodicarbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbodicarbene (CDC), unique carbenic entities bearing two lone pairs of electrons are well&#8208;known for their strong Lewis basicity. We demonstrate herein, upon introducing a weak Br&#248;nsted acid benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as a co&#8208;modulator, CDC is remoulded into a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;like reactivity. DFT calculation and experimental evidence show BnOH loosely interacting with the binding pocket of CDC via H&#8208;bonding and p&#8208;p stacking. Four distinct reactions in nature were deployed to demonstrate the viability of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as synergistic FLP/Modulator (CDC/BnOH), demonstrating enhanced catalytic reactivity in cyclotrimerization of isocyanate, polymerization process for  L  &#8208;lactide (LA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and dehydrosilylation of alcohols. Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity.

We demonstrate herein, upon introducing a weak Br&#248;nsted acid benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as a co-modulator, CDC is remoulded into a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)-like reactivity. DFT calculation and experimental evidence show BnOH loosely interacting with the binding pocket of CDC via H-bonding and p-p stacking. Four distinct reactions in nature were deployed to demonstrate the viability of proof-of-concept as synergistic FLP/Modulator (CDC/BnOH), demonstrating enhanced catalytic reactivity in cyclotrimerization of isocyanate, polymerization process for  L  -lactide (LA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and dehydrosilylation of alcohols. Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity. This finding also provides a new spin in diversifying FLP reactivity with co-modulator or co-catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Novel Bacterial Chalcone Isomerases by a Sequence&#8211;Structure&#8211;Function&#8211;Evolution Strategy for Enzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flavanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants. The first bacterial CHI (CHIera) was identified from Eubacterium ramulus, but its distribution, evolutionary source, substrate scope, and stereoselectivity are still unclear. Here, we describe the identification of 66 novel bacterial CHIs from Genbank using a novel Sequence&#8211;Structure&#8211;Function&#8211;Evolution (SSFE) strategy. These novel bacterial CHIs show diversity in substrate specificity towards various hydroxylated and methoxylated chalcones. The mutagenesis of CHIera according to the substrate binding models of these novel bacterial CHIs resulted in several variants with greatly improved activity towards these chalcones. Furthermore, the preparative scale conversion catalyzed by bacterial CHIs has been performed for five chalcones and revealed (S)&#8208;selectivity with up to 96% ee, which provides an alternative biocatalytic route for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;flavanones in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo Click Reaction of Acylsilanes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photo click reaction occurs under mild conditions (415 nm) mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals via light mediated siloxycarbene generation with subsequent indole&#8208;N&#8722;H insertion. We show that this very efficient and fully atom economic coupling process can be applied to conjugate complex systems, as documented by the clicking of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of polymer chains. The linking acetal moiety can be readily cleaved and it is also shown that wavelength&#8208;selective coupling and cleavage with acyl silanes bearing a second photoactive moiety is possible. This is documented by a successful polymerization/depolymerization sequence and by a polymer folding/unfolding process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Water Transport in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels Enabled by Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Controllable Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast water transport channels are crucial for water&#8208;related membrane separation processes. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between flux and selectivity is still a major challenge. To address this, we constructed spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) structures with a highly hydrophilic polyelectrolyte brush layer, and introduced them into GO laminates, which increased both the flux and the separation factor. At 70 &#176;C, the flux reached 5.23 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  , and the separation factor of butanol/water increased to ~8000, which places it among the most selective separation membranes reported to date. Interestingly, further studies demonstrated that the enhancement of water transport was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains, but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structure&#8211;performance correlations between water molecule migration and the flexibility of the ordered polymer chains in the 2D confined space.</dc:description>

         <title>Maximizing the Catalytic Performance of Pd@AuxPd1&#8208;x Nanocubes in H2O2 Production by Reducing Shell Thickness to Increase Compositional Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a simple route based upon seed&#8208;mediated growth to the synthesis of Pd@Au  x  Pd  1&#8208;x  (0.8&#8804;x&#8804;1) core&#8208;shell nanocubes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined {100} facets and an optimal Au/Pd ratio for the surface, the nanocubes bearing a shell made of Au  0.95  Pd  0.05  work as an efficient electrocatalyst toward H  2  O  2  production, with high selectivity of 93&#8211;100% in the low&#8208;overpotential region of 0.4&#8211;0.7 V. When the Au  0.95  Pd  0.05  alloy is confined to a shell of only three atomic layers in thickness, the electrocatalyst is able to maintain its surface structure and elemental composition, endowing continuous and stable production of H  2  O  2  during oxygen reduction at a high rate of 1.62 mol g  (Pd+Au)  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . This work demonstrates a versatile route to the rational development of active and durable electrocatalysts based upon alloy nanocrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Surface Titanium Activates Dephosphorylation Over TiO2 Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate for the first time that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation near room temperature. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine imposed on the TiO2(001) surface strongly manipulates the electronic state of surrounding Ti5C atoms by making them very acidic, facilitating not only the bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP but also its subsequent activation.







Abstract
Dephosphorylation that removes a phosphate group from substrates is an important reaction for living organisms and environmental protection. Although CeO2 has been shown to catalyze this reaction, cerium is low in natural abundance and has a narrow global distribution (&gt;90&#8201;% of these reserves are located within six countries). It is thus imperative to find another element/material with high worldwide abundance that can also efficiently extract the phosphate out of agricultural waste for phosphorus recycle. Using para&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (p&#8208;NPP) as a model compound, we demonstrate that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation at temperatures as low as 40&#8201;&#176;C. By probe&#8208;assisted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine makes Ti atoms (the active sites) on the (001) surface very acidic. The bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP on this surface further promotes its subsequent activation with a barrier &#8776;20&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower than that of the pristine (001) and (101) surfaces, allowing the activation of this reaction near room temperature (from &gt;80&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Regulating Twisted Skeleton to Construct Organ&#8208;Specific Perylene for Intensive Cancer Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we modulate perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of a twisted perylene PDIC&#8208;NC. The in vitro and in vivo biological functions of PDIC&#8208;NC are demonstrated and its molecular mechanism for the inhibiting activity on tumour cells is revealed.







Abstract
The systemic use of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer patients is a compromise between desirable therapy and side effects because of the intrinsic shortage of organ&#8208;specific pharmaceutical drug. Design and construction of pharmaceutical drug to achieve the organ&#8208;specific delivery is thus desperately desirable. We herein regulate perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of bay&#8208;twisted PDIC&#8208;NC. We further demonstrate that PDIC&#8208;NC can target into mitochondria to act as cellular respiration inhibitor, inducing insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate, promoting endogenous H2O2 and .OH burst, elevating calcium overload, efficiently triggering the synergistic apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress of lung cancer cells. The antitumor performance of PDIC&#8208;NC is verified on in vivo xenografted, metastasis and orthotopic lung cancer, presenting overwhelming evidences for potentially clinical application.

     alt="Regulating Twisted Skeleton to Construct Organ-Specific Perylene for Intensive Cancer Chemotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we modulate perylene skeleton to effect organ-specificity and present an example of lung-specific distribution on the basis of a twisted perylene PDIC-NC. The in vitro and in vivo biological functions of PDIC-NC are demonstrated and its molecular mechanism for the inhibiting activity on tumour cells is revealed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The systemic use of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer patients is a compromise between desirable therapy and side effects because of the intrinsic shortage of organ-specific pharmaceutical drug. Design and construction of pharmaceutical drug to achieve the organ-specific delivery is thus desperately desirable. We herein regulate perylene skeleton to effect organ-specificity and present an example of lung-specific distribution on the basis of bay-twisted PDIC-NC. We further demonstrate that PDIC-NC can target into mitochondria to act as cellular respiration inhibitor, inducing insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate, promoting endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH burst, elevating calcium overload, efficiently triggering the synergistic apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress of lung cancer cells. The antitumor performance of PDIC-NC is verified on in vivo xenografted, metastasis and orthotopic lung cancer, presenting overwhelming evidences for potentially clinical application. This study contributes a proof-of-concept demonstration of twisted perylene to well attain lung-specific distribution, and meanwhile achieves intensive lung cancer chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Converted In2O3 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#8208;nm In2O3 nanocubes as the precatalyst are observed to exhibit greater CO2 reduction selectivity towards formate than bulk&#8208;like samples as well as smaller nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways, suggesting that smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.







Abstract
The size modulation of catalyst particles represents a useful dimension to tune catalytic performances by impacting not only their surface areas but also local electronic structures. It, however, has remained inadequately explored and poorly elucidated. Here, we report the interesting size&#8208;dependent selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction on In2O3 nanocrystals. 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles and 15&#8208;nm nanocubes with focused size distribution are prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction in oleylamine by carefully controlling a set of experimental parameters. They serve as the precatalysts, and are reduced to In nanocrystals while largely inherit the original size feature during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Catalyst derived from 15&#8208;nm nanocubes exhibits greater formate selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) at lower overpotential and negligible side reactions compared to bulk&#8208;like samples (indium foil and 200&#8208;nm cubes) as well as the catalyst derived from smaller 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways by our theoretical computations. Smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.

         <title>Isolation of 1,4&#8208;Diarsinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide and 1,4&#8208;Diarsinine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KC8 reduction of a hypervalent arsenic heterocycle 4 affords the 1,4&#8208;diarsinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide 5 as a red crystalline solid. The C4As2 ring of 5, formally comprising 8&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electrons, is planar and exhibits antiaromatic character. Two electron oxidation of 5 with AgOTf gives the 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4As2&#8208;compound 6, which is an aromatic system.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;Diarsinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADCPh)As]2 (5) (ADCPh={C(DippN)}2CPh, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with a planar C4As2 ring fused between two 1,3&#8208;imidazole scaffolds has been isolated as a red crystalline solid. Compound 5, formally comprising an 8&#960;&#8208;electron C4As2 ring, is antiaromatic and undergoes 2e&#8208;oxidation with AgOTf to form the 6&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic system [(ADCPh)As]2(OTf)2 (6).

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Lived Triplet Excited State in Water at Room Temperature: Insights on the Molecular Design of Tridecafullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented ultra&#8208;long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (93&#8197;ms in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been measured for a globular glycodendrimeric tridecafullerene. The photophysics of S1 and T1, T1 quenching by O2 and N3&#8722;, and molecular modelling provide unequivocal evidence of the role played by the molecular design of the spacers connecting the core&#8211;shell C60 units and the C60&#8208;sugars on the degree of water solvation and its effect on this remarkable finding.







Abstract
Suitably engineered molecular systems exhibiting triplet excited states with very long lifetimes are important for high&#8208;end applications in nonlinear optics, photocatalysis, or biomedicine. We report the finding of an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;lived triplet state with a mean lifetime of 93&#8197;ms in an aqueous phase at room temperature, measured for a globular tridecafullerene with a highly compact glycodendrimeric structure. A series of three tridecafullerenes bearing different glycodendrons and spacers to the C60 units have been synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra and DLS experiments confirm their aggregation in water. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence experiments suggest a different degree of inner solvation of the multifullerenes depending on their molecular design. Efficient quenching of the triplet states by O2 but not by waterborne azide anions has been observed. Molecular modelling reveals dissimilar access of the aqueous phase to the internal structure of the tridecafullerenes, differently shielded by the glycodendrimeric shell.

         <title>Exceptional Electrochemical HER Performance with Enhanced Electron Transfer between Ru Nanoparticles and Single Atoms Dispersed on a Carbon Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based substrates with an inert surface provide weak metal&#8211;support interactions that are insufficient to effectively modulate the electronic structures of the loaded metal nanoparticles. Here we show that atomic metal species on the carbon substrate can remotely communicate with the supported metal nanoparticles, inducing synergistic electronic coupling with the nanoparticles and enabling the control of their electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Precisely regulating the electronic structures of metal active species is highly desirable for electrocatalysis. However, carbon with inert surface provide weak metal&#8211;support interaction, which is insufficient to modulate the electronic structures of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we propose a new method to control the electrocatalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles by dispersing single metal atoms on an O&#8208;doped graphene. Ideal atomic metal species are firstly computationally screened. We then verify this concept by deposition of Ru nanoparticles onto an O&#8208;doped graphene decorated with single metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consistent with theoretical predictions, such hybrid catalysts show outstanding HER performance, much superior to other reported electrocatalysts such as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. This work offers a new strategy for modulating the activity and stability of metal nanoparticles for electrocatalysis processes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme gas&#8208;phase chemistry with the exotic transactinide dubnium and its lighter homologues tantalum and niobium is described by Nadine&#8197;M. Chiera, Tetsuya&#8197;K. Sato, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102808). The sequence of volatility among group&#8208;5 elements, as deduced from the behavior of their oxychloride compounds, is in agreement with Mendeleev's law, establishing dubnium as one of the least volatile elements of the periodic table.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Fabrication and Atomic&#8208;Scale Characterization of Triply Linked, Laterally &#960;&#8208;Extended Porphyrin Nanotapes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first on&#8208;surface preparation of porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) on a gold surface. Structural and electronic characterization reveals that the Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. This study provides an alternative and versatile route to the fabrication of Por NTs and a detailed atomic&#8208;scale characterization of their structural and electronic properties.







Abstract
Porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) are promising structures for their use as molecular wires thanks to a high degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low HOMO&#8212;LUMO gaps, and exceptional conductance. Such structures have been prepared in solution, but their on&#8208;surface synthesis remains unreported. Here, meso&#8211;meso triply fused Por NTs have been prepared through a two&#8208;step synthesis on Au(111). The diradical character of the on&#8208;surface formed building block PorA2, a phenalenyl &#960;&#8208;extended ZnIIPor, facilitates intermolecular homocoupling and allows for the formation of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended tapes. The structural and electronic properties of individual Por NTs are addressed, both on Au(111) and on a thin insulating NaCl layer, by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy complemented by DFT calculations. These Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. Our study provides a versatile route towards Por NTs and the atomic&#8208;scale characterization of such tapes.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Based on a Phase&#8208;Stabilized &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and efficient CsPbI3 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are demonstrated by resurfacing perovskite with the aid of inorganic ligands (KI). The resurfaced perovskites show a 7&#215; higher phase stability and higher thermal conductivity than in films with organic ligands. The PLEDs exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;% and a 100&#8208;fold improvement in the operating stability compared to previous EQE devices.







Abstract
The all&#8208;inorganic nature of CsPbI3 perovskites allows to enhance stability in perovskite devices. Research efforts have led to improved stability of the black phase in CsPbI3 films; however, these strategies&#8212;including strain and doping&#8212;are based on organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;capped perovskites, which prevent perovskites from forming the close&#8208;packed quantum dot (QD) solids necessary to achieve high charge and thermal transport. We developed an inorganic ligand exchange that leads to CsPbI3 QD films with superior phase stability and increased thermal transport. The atomic&#8208;ligand&#8208;exchanged QD films, once mechanically coupled, exhibit improved phase stability, and we link this to distributing strain across the film. Operando measurements of the temperature of the LEDs indicate that KI&#8208;exchanged QD films exhibit increased thermal transport compared to controls that rely on organic ligands. The LEDs exhibit a maximum EQE of 23&#8201;% with an electroluminescence emission centered at 640&#8197;nm (FWHM: &#8776;31&#8197;nm). These red LEDs provide an operating half&#8208;lifetime of 10&#8197;h (luminance of 200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and an operating stability that is 6&#215; higher than that of control devices.

Biocatalytic late&#8208;stage modifications offer attractive methods to selectively functionalise complex molecules. Amidst an ever&#8208;growing number of enzymes, modular toolboxes of enzymatic transformations have been made available in synthesis today. Vast sets of biocatalysts are able to address manifold diversifications of interest, e.g., applied for drug development. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202014931), Nicholas&#8197;J.

         <title>Rotaxane CoII Complexes as Field&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Ion Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked ligands enable predictable metal ion coordination, offering a new strategy to engineer their properties. A series of field&#8208;induced CoII single&#8208;ion magnets illustrates this principle. The predictable coordination behaviour of the rotaxane enables remarkably accurate calculation of their zero&#8208;field splittings, which are in agreement with experimental observations, and can be rationalized in terms of metal&#8211;ligand bonding.







Abstract
Mechanically chelating ligands have untapped potential for the engineering of metal ion properties. Here we demonstrate this principle in the context of CoII&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnets. Using multi&#8208;frequency EPR, susceptibility and magnetization measurements we found that these complexes show some of the highest zero field splittings reported for five&#8208;coordinate CoII complexes to date. The predictable coordination behaviour of the interlocked ligands allowed the magnetic properties of their CoII complexes to be evaluated computationally a priori and our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to rationalize the observed trends. The predictable magnetic behaviour of the rotaxane CoII complexes demonstrates that interlocked ligands offer a new strategy to design metal complexes with interesting functionality.

The predictable coordination behaviour of the interlocked ligands allowed the magnetic properties of their Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes to be evaluated computationally a priori and our combined experimental and theoretical approach enabled us to rationalize the observed trends. The predictable magnetic behaviour of the rotaxane Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes demonstrates that interlocked ligands offer a new strategy to design metal complexes with interesting functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designer Nanomaterials through Programmable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles have long been recognized for their unique properties arising from their nanoscale morphology. While these phenomena offer exciting potential applications across optics, electronics, magnetism, and catalysis, these specific functions often require a designed organization of particles. This organizational control includes the type of order as well as placement and orientation of particles of the same or different kinds relative to each other. Although self&#8208;assembly processes can lead to a plethora of structures, the key aspect of rational material fabrication&#8212;designability&#8212;is difficult to achieve. DNA nanotechnology offers the ability to introduce highly addressable bonds, tailor particle interactions, and control the geometry of bindings motifs. Together, these features uniquely position DNA&#8208;based methods to tackle the problem of building fully designed nanomaterials. Here, we discuss how developments in structural DNA nanotechnology have enabled greater control over 1D, 2D, and 3D particle organizations through programmable assembly. This review focuses on how the use of DNA binding between nano&#8208;components and DNA structural motifs has progressively allowed rational formation of prescribed particle organizations. We offer insight into how DNA&#8208;based motifs and elements can be further developed to control particle organizations and how particles and DNA can be integrated into nanoscale building blocks, so called &#8216;material voxels&#8217;, to realize designer nanomaterials with desired functions.</dc:description>

         <title>From Selection to Instruction and Back &#8212; Competing Conformational Selection and Induced Fit Pathways in Abiotic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two limiting cases of molecular recognition, induced fit (IF) and conformational selection (CS), play a central role in allosteric regulation of natural systems. The IF paradigm states that a substrate &#8220;instructs&#8221; the host to change its shape after complexation, while CS asserts that a guest &#8220;selects&#8221; the optimal fit from an ensemble of preexisting host conformations. With no studies that quantitatively address the interplay of two limiting pathways in abiotic systems, we herein and for the first time describe the way by which twisted capsule&#160;  M  &#8208;  1,&#160;  encompassing two conformers&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  (+) and&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ), traps CX  4  &#160;(X = Cl, Br) to give CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  (+)  &#160;  and  &#160;  CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ), with all four states being in thermal equilibrium. With the assistance of 2D EXSY, we found that CBr  4  &#160;would, at its lower concentrations, bind&#160;  M  &#8208;  1&#160;  via&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  (+)&#8594;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; )&#8594;CBr  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ) pathway corresponding to conformational selection. Nudged elastic band (NEB) coupled with density functional theory (DFT) computations revealed the mechanism of&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; )/  M  &#8208;  1  (+) interconversion from which we deduced that the reduced rate for CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ) converting  &#160;  into  &#160;  CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  (+) resulted from favorable C&#8212;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl/Br&#8212;C host&#8208;guest contacts stabilizing the corresponding ground state. For&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  &#160;complexing CCl  4&#160;  though,  &#160;  we used data from 2D EXSY measurements and 1D NMR lineshape analysis to characterize the dynamics of every elementary step in the four&#8208;state equilibrium. Subsequently, the contribution of IF and CS was determined using flux analysis wherein the mass transport (i.e. flux) through each particular pathway was quantified. Importantly, we found that lower CCl  4  &#160;concentrations would favor CS while the IF pathway prevailed at higher proportions of the guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Crystallization&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Probes To Detect Amorphous Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission dyes were rationally designed to detect amorphous protein aggregation with controllable sensitivity, color, and cellular performance (see structure). A dimethylaminophenylene group enabled selective binding and fluorescence enhancement, and the emission wavelength could be tuned by altering the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the other ring while retaining selective detection.







Abstract
Unlike amyloid aggregates, amorphous protein aggregates with no defined structures have been challenging to target and detect in a complex cellular milieu. In this study, we rationally designed sensors of amorphous protein aggregation from aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission probes (AIEgens). Utilizing dicyanoisophorone as a model AIEgen scaffold, we first sensitized the fluorescence of AIEgens to a nonpolar and viscous environment mimicking the interior of amorphous aggregated proteins. We identified a generally applicable moiety (dimethylaminophenylene) for selective binding and fluorescence enhancement. Regulation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups tuned the emission wavelength while retaining selective detection. Finally, we utilized the optimized probe to systematically image aggregated proteome upon proteostasis network regulation. Overall, we present a rational approach to develop amorphous protein aggregation sensors from AIEgens with controllable sensitivity, spectral coverage, and cellular performance.

         <title>SO2 Capture using Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized porous organic cage (POC) demonstrating high SO2 capture capability and reversibility is reported by Andrew&#8197;I. Cooper, Ilich&#8197;A. Ibarra, Ming Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104555). The main source of SO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels, and alkaline scrubber&#8208;based technologies are the main desulphuratrion methods in industry, which often cause corrosion of pipes and generate huge amount of wasterwater. With good processibility and proven scalability, POC materials offer a more sustainable option for SO2 capture.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Coupling via Kinetic Resolution Enabled by a Bulky and Flexible Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented low&#8208;temperature, asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of sterically hindered secondary amines with aryl chlorides via kinetic resolution is reported. A bulky yet flexible, chiral NHC ligand enables both low barrier oxidative addition and reductive elimination and high levels of enantiocontrol. Computational studies indicate that multiple &#963;&#8208;bond rotations of the C2&#8208;symmetric chiral NHC adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling has revolutionized the construction of amines. Despite the innovations of multiple generations of ligands to modulate the reactivity of the metal center, ligands for the low&#8208;temperature enantioselective amination of aryl halides remain a coveted target of catalyst engineering. Designs that promote one elementary reaction often create bottlenecks at other steps. We here report an unprecedented low&#8208;temperature (as low as &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C), enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides with sterically hindered secondary amines via a kinetic resolution process (s factor up to &gt;300). A bulky yet flexible chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand is leveraged to drive both oxidative addition and reductive elimination with low barriers and control the enantioselectivity. Computational studies indicate that the rotations of multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds on the C2&#8208;symmetric chiral ligand adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes. We expect this design would be widely applicable to diverse transition states to achieve other challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Computational studies indicate that the rotations of multiple &#963;-bonds on the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric chiral ligand adapt to the changing needs of catalytic processes. We expect this design would be widely applicable to diverse transition states to achieve other challenging metal-catalyzed asymmetric cross-coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Total Structure of Bimetallic Coreshell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8208; Nanocluster and Its Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic coreshell nanostructures hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism. However, it remains a challenge to construct atomically precise core&#8208;shell with high&#8208;valence active metals on the gold surface. In this work, we report the total structure of a [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8208; coreshell nanocluster and multiple implications. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) reveals that the structure possesses a two&#8208;shelled Au6@Au36 core and a closed cadmium shell of Cd40, and the coreshell structure is then protected by 52 thiolate (&#8208;SR) ligands. The composition of the nanocluster is further confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). A catalytic test for styrene oxidation and a comparison with relevant nanoclusters reveal the surface effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Synthesis of Vicinal Diamines from Diols through Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein an unprecedented diastereoconvergent synthesis of vicinal diamines from diols through an economical, redox&#8208;neutral process. Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8208;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, the first enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.</dc:description>

         <title>A Primary Acyl Phosphine Stabilized by a Phosphonium Ylide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Primary acyl&#8208;phosphines are scare in the literature. Here we show that the reaction of Ph  3  GePCO with the ylide Ph  3  PCH  2  proceeds to give the species Ph  3  PCHC(O)PH(GePh  3  )  1  . Deprotonation of  1  with Na[N(SiMe  3  )  2  ] generates the salt [Na(THF)  2  ][Ph  3  PCHC(O)P(GePh  3  )]  2  which provides subsequent access to the  bis  &#8208;germanylated acylphosphine, Ph  3  PCHC(O)P(GePh  3  )  2  3  . Alternatively, treatment of  1  with HCl in dioxane affords the primary acylphosphine Ph  3  PCHC(O)PH  2  4  . Compound  4  is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines and the first devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems Based on AIEgen&#8208;branched Rotaxane Dendrimers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty&#8208;one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen&#8208;branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent&#8208;induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) process. Moreover, novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed based on these AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers, which revealed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of pi&#8208;donating amido with pi&#8208;accepting pyridine coordination units in a tridentate chelate ligand causes a strong nephelauxetic effect in a homoleptic Cr(III) complex, which shifts its luminescence to the NIR&#8208;II spectral range. Previously explored Cr(III) polypyridine complexes typically emit between 727 and 778 nm (in the red to NIR&#8208;I spectral region), and ligand design strategies have so far concentrated on optimizing the ligand field strength. The present work takes a fundamentally different approach and focusses on increasing metal&#8208;ligand bond covalence to shift the ruby&#8208;like 2E emission of Cr(III) to 1067 nm at 77 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrodiolide Diversification Reveals Broad Immunosuppressive Activity That Impairs the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new immunomodulatory agents can impact various areas of medicine. In particular, compounds with the ability to modulate innate immunological pathways hold significant unexplored potential. Here, we report a modular synthetic approach to the macrodiolide natural product (&#8208;)&#8208;vermiculine, an agent previously shown to possess diverse biological effects including cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity.&#160; The synthesis allows for a very high degree of flexibility in introducing new modifications to the macrocyclic framework including the formation of all possible stereoisomers. In total 18 analogues were prepared. Biological characterization revealed that analogues LH531 and LH519, which both possess very minor structural modifications, had clearly enhanced cancer cell line selectivity and reduced toxicity. Moreover, these compounds possessed broad inhibitory activity against innate immunological pathways in human PBMCs, including the DNA&#8208;sensing cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Initial mechanistic characterization suggests a surprising impairment on the STING&#8208;TBK1 interaction that prompts interesting questions for future studies of the immunosuppressive actions.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroleptic Ligation by an endo&#8208;Functionalized Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasiheteroleptic&#160;complexes with properly endo&#8208;functionalized cages as&#160;ligands is presented. The cage ligand&#160;reported here is of a covalent&#160;organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial&#160;chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine.&#160;Inspired by&#160;enzymatic active sites the described system bears one carboxylate&#160;and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through&#160;which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the&#160;iron(II) complex in solution and the solid&#8208;state validate the structure&#160;and show that no undesired, but commonly observed dimerization&#160;process takes place. The solid&#8208;state structure shows a five&#8208;coordinate&#160;metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which&#160;makes Fe@2 an unprecedently detailed structural model complex for&#160;this kind of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenases. As, proven by the crystal&#160;structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the&#160;biologically relevant ligand &#120572; &#8208;ketoglutarate is implemented. We&#160;observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens&#160;studies investigating Fe@2 as a functional model complex.</dc:description>

The cage ligand&#160;reported here is of a covalent&#160;organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial&#160;chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine.&#160;Inspired by&#160;enzymatic active sites the described system bears one carboxylate&#160;and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through&#160;which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the&#160;iron(II) complex in solution and the solid-state validate the structure&#160;and show that no undesired, but commonly observed dimerization&#160;process takes place. The solid-state structure shows a five-coordinate&#160;metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which&#160;makes Fe@2 an unprecedently detailed structural model complex for&#160;this kind of non-heme iron oxygenases. As, proven by the crystal&#160;structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the&#160;biologically relevant ligand &#120572; -ketoglutarate is implemented. We&#160;observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens&#160;studies investigating Fe@2 as a functional model complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Functionalized Nanowires to Construct Nanoelectrodes for Intracellular Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoelectrochemistry is widely recognized as a powerful tool for in situ studying processes at nanoscale. However, the exiting strategies for nanoelectrodes preparation usually suffer from limited variety of electrode materials, time&#8208;consuming fabrication procedures and difficulties in functionalization. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8208;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8208;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8208;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells. This work provides a brand new idea for facile construction of high&#8208;performance functionalized nanoelectrodes, which is of great benefit for the research on nanoscale processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Binding Initiated Activation of O&#8722;H Bonds on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Surface for Catalytic Oxidation of Biomass Hydroxyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen binding of molecules on specific solid surface is an attractive interaction that can be employed as driving force for chemical bond activation, material directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surface seriously limits its application. Herein, we measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G  0  ) of surface HBs using NMR technique. HBs accepting ability of surface was investigated in term of comparing &#916;G  0  values by employing model biomass platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;n catalysts with electron&#8208;rich doped&#8208;nitrogen contents adjusted. Reducing the &#916;G  0  effectively improves HBs accepting ability of the nitrogen&#8208;doped surface, and promotes the O&#8722;H bonds selectively initiated activation in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated and the rate constant is significantly increased. In addition to excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) value for this oxidation is extremely higher than the reported non&#8208;noble metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex&#160;N&#8208;glycans of the parasite&#160;S.mansoni&#160;to examine the importance of epitope presentation on DC&#8208;SIGN recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of multivalency&#160; for&#160;  N  &#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions&#160; has primarily been studied by attachment of minimal epitopes to artificial multivalent scaffold and not in the context of multi&#8208;antennary glycans.&#160;  N  &#8208;glycans can be modified by bisecting GlcNAc, core xylosides &#160;and fucosides, and extended&#160;  N  &#8208;acetyl lactosamine moieties. The impact of such modifications on glycan recognition are also not well understood. &#160;We describe here a &#160; chemoenzymatic &#160;methodology that can provide&#160;  N  &#8208;glycans expressed by the parasitic worm&#160;  S. mansoni  &#160; having &#160; unique epitopes at each antenna &#160;and contain core xyloside. NMR, computational and electron microscopy were employed to investigate recognition of the glycans by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN. It &#160;revealed that core xyloside does not influence terminal epitope recognition.&#160; The multi&#8208;antennary glycans bound with higher affinity to DC&#8208;SIGN compared to mono&#8208;valent&#160; counterparts, which was attributed to&#160;proximity&#8208;induced effective concentration.&#160; The multi&#8208;antennary glycans &#160;cross&#8208;linked &#160;DC&#8208;SIGN into a dense network, which likely is relevant for antigen uptake and intracellular routing.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Enabled Organocatalyzed Controlled Alternating Terpolymerization of Perfluorinated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerizations of perfluorinated vinyl ethers (PFVEs) provide an important category of fluoropolymers that have received considerable interests in applications. In this work, we report the development of an organocatalyzed controlled radical alternating terpolymerization of PFVEs and vinyl ethers (VEs) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method not only enables the synthesis of a broad scope of fluorinated terpolymers of low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity, facilitating tuning the chemical compositions by rationally choosing the type and/or ratio of comonomers, but also allows temporal control of chain&#8208;growth, as well as the preparation of a variety of novel fluorinated block copolymers. To showcase the versatility of this method, fluorinated alternating terpolymers have been synthesized and customized to simultaneously display a variety of desirable properties for solid polymer electrolyte design, creating new opportunities in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular basis for two stereoselective Diels&#8208;Alderases that produce decalin skeletons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyzing [4+2] cycloaddition&#160;have attracted increasing attention because of their key roles in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we solved the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular [4+2] cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds during biosynthesis of the HIV&#8208;1 integrase inhibitor equisetin and its stereochemical opposite, phomasetin. Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state&#8208;like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein&#8208;substrate interactions. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ implanting single tungsten site into defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by solvent&#8208;free route for efficient oxidative desulfurization at room temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of single site catalysts with catalytic sites at atomic&#8208;scale and high atom utilization, provides new opportunities to gain superior catalytic performance for targeted reactions. In this contribution, we report a one&#8208;pot green approach for in&#8208;situ implanting single tungsten site (up to 12.7 wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free condition. The catalysts displayed extraordinary activity for the oxidative removal of sulfur compounds (1000 ppm S) at room temperature within 30 min. The turnover frequency (TOF) value can reach 44.0 h  &#8208;1  at 30&#176;C, which is 109.0, 12.3 and 1.2 times higher than that of pristine UiO&#8208;66(Zr), WO  3  , and WCl  6  (homogeneous catalyst). Theoretical and experimental studies show that the anchored W sites can react with oxidant readily and generate W(VI)&#8208;peroxo intermediates that determine the reaction activity. Our work not only manifests the application of SSCs in the field of desulfurization of fuel oil but also opens a new solvent&#8208;free avenue for fabricating MOFs based SSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Triple Vertex Linkage of (BO4)&#8208;Tetrahedra in a Borosulfate: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Quantum Chemical Investigation of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borosulfates are classified as silicate analogue materials. The number of crystallographically characterized compounds is still limited, whereas the structural diversity is already impressive. The anionic substructures of borosulfates exhibit vertex connected (BO  4  )&#8208; and (SO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra, whereas bridging between two (SO  4  )&#8208; or even between two (BO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra is scarce. The herein presented compound Sr[B  3  O(SO  4  )  4  (SO  4  H)] is the first borosulfate with a triple vertex linkage of three (BO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra  via  one common oxygen atom. DFT calculations complement the experimental studies. Bader charges (calculated for all atoms) as well as charge density calculations give hint to the electron distribution within the anionic substructure and DOS calculations support the interpretation of the bonding situation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Decorated Amorphous/Crystalline RuO2 with Rich Oxygen Vacancies: A Robust pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction for many electrochemical devices. To date, many OER electrocatalysts function well in alkaline media, but exhibit poor performances in neutral and acidic media, especially the acidic stability. Herein, sodium&#8208;decorated amorphous/crystalline RuO  2  with rich oxygen vacancies (a/c&#8208;RuO  2  ) was developed as a pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. The a/c&#8208;RuO  2  shows remarkable resistance to acid corrosion and oxidation during OER, which leads to an extremely high catalytic stability, as confirmed by a negligible overpotential increase after continuously catalyzing OER for 60 h at pH = 1. Besides, a/c&#8208;RuO  2  also exhibits superior OER activities to commercial RuO  2  and most reported OER catalysts under all pH conditions. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Na dopant and oxygen vacancy in RuO  2  weakens the adsorption strength of the OER intermediates by engineering the  d  &#8208;band center, thereby lowering the energy barrier for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Mitochondrial MicroRNAs via Optically Programmable Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNA (miRNA) functions are tightly regulated by their sub&#8208;compartmental location in living cells, and the ability to imaging of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs) is essential for understanding of the related pathological processes. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based methods could not be used for this purpose. Here, we report the development of a DNA nanoreporter technology for imaging of mitomiRs in living cells through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNA strand displacement reactions. The sensing function of the DNA nanoreporters are silent (OFF) during the delivery process, but can be photoactivated (ON) with NIR light after targeted mitochondrial localization, enabling spatially&#8208;restricted imaging of two types of cancer&#8208;related mitomiRs with improved detection accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate imaging of mitomiRs in vivo through spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled delivery and activation. Therefore, this study illustrates a simple methodology that may be broadly applicable for investigating the mitomiRs&#8208;associated physiological events.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Osteopontin Fragment Orders During Interfacial Calcium Oxalate Mineralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium oxalate (CaC  2  O  4  ) is the major component of kidney stone, a prevalent chronic human disease worldwide. The acidic osteopontin (OPN) protein in human urine can effectively inhibit the growth of CaC  2  O  4  crystals, thereby acting as a potent stone preventer. Previous studies in bulk solution all attest to the importance of binding and recognition of OPN at the CaC  2  O  4  mineral surface, yet molecular level insights into the active interface during CaC  2  O  4  mineralization are still lacking. Here, we probe the structure of the central OPN fragment and its interaction with Ca  2+  and CaC  2  O  4  at the water&#8208;air interface using surface&#8208;specific non&#8208;linear vibrational spectroscopy. While OPN peptides remain largely disordered in solution, our results reveal that the bidentate binding of Ca  2+  ions refold the interfacial peptides into well&#8208;ordered and assembled beta turn motifs. One critical intermediate directs mineralization by releasing structural freedom of backbone and binding side chains. These insights into the mineral interface are crucial for understanding the pathological development of kidney stones and possibly relevant for calcium oxalate biomineralization in general.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to block copolymers from monomers that do not polymerize via a common mechanism requires initiation from a multifunctional species that allows orthogonal polymerization chemistries. We disclose a strategy to provide well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;  b  &#8208;polyether block copolymers by a one&#8208;pot combination of photoiniferter polymerization and organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using a hydroxy&#8208;functionalized trithiocarbonate photoiniferter as the dual initiator at ambient temperature. Our results reveal good compatibility between the two polymerization systems and highlight that they can be performed in arbitrary order or simultaneously with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality. We also demonstrate selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP. We harnessed the efficiency of combining these polymerization systems to provide tailor&#8208;made block copolymers from chemically distinct monomers.</dc:description>

The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual surface texture, dimensions and morphology variations of chiral and single crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here a unique metallo&#8208;organic material where the appearance and the internal crystal structure are in contradiction. The egg&#8208;shaped (ovoid) crystals have a brain&#8208;like texture. Although these micro&#8208;sized crystals are monodispersed; like fingerprints their grainy surfaces are never exactly alike. Remarkably, our X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction studies unexpectedly revealed that these structures are single&#8208;crystals comprising a continuous coordination network of two differently shaped homochiral channels. By using the same building blocks under different reaction conditions, a rare series of crystals have been obtained that are uniquely rounded in their shape. In stark contrast to the brain&#8208;like crystals, these isostructural and monodispersed crystals have a comparatively smooth appearance. The sizes of these crystals vary by several orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

         <title>Shadow electrochemiluminescence microscopy of single mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are the subcellular bioenergetic organelles. The analysis of their morphology and topology is essential to provide useful information on their activity and metabolism. Herein, we report a label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting reactive layer to image single living mitochondria deposited on the electrode surface. The ECL mechanism of the freely&#8208;diffusing [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  dye with the sacrificial tri&#8208;  n  &#8208;propylamine&#160;coreactant restrains the light&#8208;emitting region to a micrometric thickness allowing to visualize individual mitochondria with a remarkable sharp negative optical contrast. The imaging approach named &#8220;shadow ECL&#8221; (SECL) reflects the negative imprint of the local diffusional hindrance of the ECL reagents by each mitochondrion. The statistical analysis of the colocalization of the shadow ECL spots with the functional mitochondria revealed by classical fluorescent biomarkers, MitoTracker Deep Red and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH, validates the reported methodology. The versatility and extreme sensitivity of the approach are further demonstrated by visualizing single mitochondria, which remain hardly detectable with the usual biomarkers. Finally, by alleviating problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with conventional microscopy methods, SECL microscopy should find promising applications in the imaging of subcellular structures.</dc:description>
