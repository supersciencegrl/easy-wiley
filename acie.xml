         <title>Branched Poly(aryl piperidinium) Membranes for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising, next&#8208;generation fuel cell technology. AEMFCs require highly conductive and robust anion exchange membranes (AEMs), which are challenging to develop due to the tradeoff between conductivity and water uptake. Here we report a method to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs. We show that branching reduces water uptake, leading to improved dimensional stability. The optimized membrane, b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5, exhibits simultaneously high OH  &#8208;  conductivity (&gt;145 mS cm  &#8208;1  at 80  o  C), high mechanical strength and dimensional stability, good processability, and excellent alkaline stability (&gt; 1500 h) in 1 M KOH at 80  o  C. AEMFCs based on b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 reached peak power densities of 2.3 W cm  &#8208;2  in H  2  &#8208;O  2  and 1.3 W cm  &#8208;2  in H  2  &#8208;air at 80  o  C. The AEMFCs can run stably under a constant current of 0.2 A cm  &#8208;2  over 500 h, during which the b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 membrane remains stable.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Covalent Headpiece Enables Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of a proper encoding methodology is one of the most important aspects when practicing DEL technology. A &#8220;headpiece&#8221;&#8208;based double&#8208;stranded DEL encoding method is currently the most widely used for productive DEL. However, the robustness of double&#8208;stranded DEL construction conflicts with the versatility presented by single&#8208;stranded DEL applications. We here report a novel encoding method, which is based on a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221;. The RCHP allows reversible interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA formats, providing an avenue to robust synthesis and allowing for the applications in distinct setups. We have validated the versatility of this encoding method with encoded self&#8208;assembled chemical library and DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic library technology. Notably, based on the RCHP&#8208;settled library construction, a unique &#8220;ternary covalent complex&#8221; mediating ligand isolation methodologies against non&#8208;immobilized targets was developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious and Efficient ortho&#8208;Selective Trifluoromethanesulfonylation of Arylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal and oxidant&#8208;free, practical and efficient method for the synthesis of highly versatile and synthetically useful  ortho  &#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated anilines from arylhydroxylamines and trifluoromethanesulfinic chloride was developed. This rapid transformation proceeded smoothly with good yields and excellent  ortho  &#8208;selectivity in the absence of any metals or ligands. Mechanistically, the reaction comprised a noncanonical  O  &#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfinylation of the arylhydroxylamine, and the subsequent [2, 3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to afford  ortho  &#8208;trifluoromethane&#8208;sulfonylated aniline derivatives. The practical application of this reaction was demonstrated by further conversion into a series of functional molecules under different reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature,    many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape morphing and reversible color changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with   dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes,  hrmI  /  belK  and  hrmJ  /  belL  , were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using  in vivo  and  in vitro  assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#949;&#8208;amino group of L&#8208;lysine to afford L&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine. Subsequently, HrmJ and BelL, which are iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases, effectively convert L&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine to 3&#8208;(  trans  &#8208;2&#8208;nitrocyclopropyl)alanine through C4&#8211;C6 bond installation. These observations disclose a novel pathway of cyclopropane ring construction and exemplify the new chemistry involving metalloenzymes in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and  n  &#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091%, tensile strength up to 11.5 MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180 &#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to hindrance, the TPE helicates could emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that could emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) light, exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives in CPL spectra, enable CPL further enhancement. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possessed amino groups with a planar structure and sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen that are never reported, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and highly chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.</dc:description>

The influences of the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents on the N&#8208;F bond lengths are evaluated for the series N  2  F  +  , N  2  F  3  +  , NF  2  O  +  , NH  3  F  +  , NH  2  F  2  +  , and NF  4  +  . It is shown that the N&#8208;F bond length decreases from 1.40 &#197; to 1.26 &#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom, and that unusual N&#8208;F bond lengths reported in the previous literature are caused by disorder problems</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Homologation of 4&#8208;Substituted Cyclohexanones with CF3CHN2: Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Cycloheptanones</title>

         <dc:description>Introduction of trifluoromethyl group (CF  3  ) into organic molecules in enantioselective manner has attracted significant attentions, but still remains a challenging problem. We herein report a catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylation of cyclic ketones via Sc(III)/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed homologation reaction by employing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane (CF  3  CHN  2  ) as the CF  3  source. This desymmetrization process is highly efficient and generates two chiral centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, affording chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl cyclic ketones in a straightforward manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabilisers allow GFP&#8208;imaging&#8208;compatible, optical control over the microtubule cytoskeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical methods to modulate microtubule dynamics have promise for reaching the micron&#8208; and millisecond&#8208;scale resolution needed to decrypt the roles of the cytoskeleton in biology. However, optical microtubule stabilisers are under&#8208;developed. We introduce "STEpos" as GFP&#8208;orthogonal, light&#8208;responsive epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabilisers. They use a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch in a design to modulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric effects that control epothilone potency. STEpos photocontrol microtubule dynamics and cell division with micron&#8208; and second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision. They substantially improve potency, solubility, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;use compared to previous optical microtubule stabilisers, and the structure&#8208;photoswitching&#8208;activity relationship insights in this work will guide future optimisations. The STEpo reagents can contribute greatly to high&#8208;precision research in cytoskeleton biophysics, cargo transport, cell motility, cell division, development, and neuroscience.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of Poly(silylether)s: Access to Degradable Polymers from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of new materials with tunable properties and intrinsic recyclability, derived from biomass under mild conditions, stands as a gold standard in polymer chemistry. Reported herein are platinum complexes which catalyze the formation of poly(silylether)s (PSEs) at low catalyst loadings. These polymers are directly obtained from dual&#8208;functional biobased building blocks such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or vanillin, coupled with various dihydrosilanes. Access to different types of copolymer architectures (statistical or alternating) is highlighted by several synthetic strategies. The materials obtained were then characterized as low  T  g  materials (ranging from &#8208;60 to 29&#176;C), stable upon heating (  T  &#8208;5%  up to 301&#176;C) and resistant towards uncatalyzed methanolysis. Additionally, quantitative chemical recycling of several PSEs could be triggered by acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis or methanolysis. These results emphasize the interest of biobased poly(silylether)s as sustainable materials with high recycling potential.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964; &gt; 0.7 s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function is relying on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed.

A strategy toward the optimization of photothermal conversion materials with broad optical absorption and high conversion efficiency via the d&#8208;d interband transitions is demonstrated. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles could realize an excellent solar harvesting performance especially compositing with up to seven 3d elements in a single phase, ascribing to the fully filled energy regions below and above the Fermi level.







Abstract
Photothermal materials with broadband optical absorption and high conversion efficiency are intensively pursued to date. Here, proposing by the d&#8208;d interband transitions, we report an unprecedented high&#8208;entropy alloy FeCoNiTiVCrCu nanoparticles that the energy regions below and above the Fermi level (&#177;4&#8197;eV) have been fully filled by the 3d transition metals, which realizes an average absorbance greater than 96&#8201;% in the entire solar spectrum (wavelength of 250 to 2500&#8197;nm). Furthermore, we also calculated the photothermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation rate towards the steam generation. Due to its pronounced full light capture and ultrafast local heating, our high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle&#8208;based solar steam generator has over 98&#8201;% efficiency under one sun irradiation, meanwhile enabling a high evaporation rate of 2.26&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Strongly Coupled Cobalt Diselenide Monolayers for Selective Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2 under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 26922-26931, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that narrows the interlayer distance of cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) is reported, which enables strong coupling between CoSe2 monolayers. The strongly coupled CoSe2 can catalyze electrosynthesis of H2O2 in acidic media efficiently, which yields Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming all catalysts reported previously in acidic environments.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth&#8208;abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), which creates high&#8208;performance catalyst to selectively drive two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction toward H2O2 in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe2 atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H2O2 production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe2 catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8722;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100&#8197;hours.

Guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) was firstly realized in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework with photochromic azobenzene guests.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that can be reversibly switched by light are of immense interest. Among them, photo&#8208;responsive spin crossover (SCO) complexes have great promises to combine the photoactive inputs with multifaceted outputs into switchable materials and devices. However, the reversible control the spin&#8208;state change by photochromic guests is still challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), [Fe(bpn){Ag(CN)2}2]&#8901;azobenzene. (1, bpn=1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)naphthalene). The reversible trans&#8211;cis photoisomerization of azobenzene guest upon UV/Vis irradiation in the solid&#8208;state results in the remarkable magnetic changes in a wide temperature range of 10&#8211;180&#8197;K. This finding not only establishes a new switching mechanism for SCO complexes, but also paves the way toward the development of new generation of photo&#8208;responsive magnetic materials.

Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks have been designed and prepared following a novel strategy for the construction of endurable and reliable memory devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memristor&#8208;based COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT thin film showed typical rewritable resistive switching behavior, a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105), good endurance of 319 cycles, and a long retention time of 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s.







Abstract
Developing new materials for the fabrication of resistive random&#8208;access memory is of great significance in this period of big data. Herein, we present a novel design strategy of embedding donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments into imine&#8208;linked frameworks to construct resistive switching covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for high&#8208;performance memristors. Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional COFs, COF&#8208;BT&#8208;TT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT, were designed and synthesized using a conventional solvothermal approach, and high&#8208;quality thin films of these materials deposited on ITO substrate exhibited great potential as an active layer for memristors. Rewritable memristors based on 100&#8197;nm thick COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT films showed a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105 and 104) and low driving voltage (1.30 and 1.60&#8197;V). The cycle period and retention time for COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT&#8208;based rewritable devices were as high as 319 cycles and 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s at a constant voltage of 0.1&#8197;V (160 cycles and 1.2&#215;104&#8197;s for the COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT memristor).

A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine (1) and arborisidine (2) was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine (1) and arborisidine (2) and their hidden topological connection.







Abstract
A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine and arborisidine was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine and arborisidine and their hidden topological connection. The branch point was reached through a Michael and Mannich cascade process. A site&#8208;selective intramolecular Mannich reaction was developed to construct the tetracyclic core of arboridinine, while a site&#8208;selective intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of ketone was used to access the tetracyclic core of arborisidine. A strategic Peterson olefination through intramolecular nucleophile delivery was able to set up the exocyclic olefin of arboridinine.

         <title>Parahydrogen Hyperpolarization Allows Direct NMR Detection of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids in Complex (Bio)mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 26954-26959, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization allows the detection and quantification of &#945;&#8208;amino acids down to sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method can also be applied to aqueous mixtures after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment. This direct approach was tested on human urine, allowing a well&#8208;resolved detection of amino acids despite the complexity of the mixture.







Abstract
The scope of non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization (nhPHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low&#8208;cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to nhPHIP for unmodified &#945;&#8208;amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method was tested on human urine, in which natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids could be measured after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Alkyl Iodides Enabled by Aryl Radical Activation of Carbon&#8211;Iodine Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27070-27077, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aryl radical activation strategy has been developed that can engage unactivated alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The strategy is based on the largely overlooked yet highly efficient reactivity of aryl radicals to abstract iodine atoms from alkyl iodides.







Abstract
The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8208;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Photoinduced Unfolding of Supramolecular Polymers Leading to Topological Block Nanofibers</title>

Helically folded supramolecular polymers with a high internal rigidity undergo non&#8208;uniform unfolding upon UV&#8208;irradiation, affording topological block nanofibers consisting of two distinct domains with helically folded and unfolded structures.







Abstract
Synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional nanofibers with distinct topological (higher&#8208;order structural) domains in the same main chain is one of the challenging topics in modern supramolecular polymer chemistry. Non&#8208;uniform structural transformation of supramolecular polymer chains by external stimuli may enable preparation of such nanofibers. To demonstrate feasibility of this post&#8208;polymerization strategy, we prepared a photoresponsive helically folded supramolecular polymers from a barbiturate monomer containing an azobenzene&#8208;embedded rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold. In contrast to previous helically folded supramolecular polymers composed of a more flexible azobenzene monomer, UV&#8208;light induced unfolding of the newly prepared helically folded supramolecular polymers occurred nonuniformly, affording topological block copolymers consisting of folded and unfolded domains. The formation of such blocky copolymers indicates that the photoinduced unfolding of the helically folded structures initiates from relatively flexible parts such as termini or defects. Spontaneous refolding of the unfolded domains was observed after visible&#8208;light irradiation followed by aging to restore fully folded structures.

         <title>Ultrahigh Supramolecular Cascaded Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Capturing System</title>

An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded RTP&#8208;capturing system was constructed based on a multivalent supramolecular aggregate using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD) in aqueous medium. Energy transfer from G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD to primary (RhB or DBT) and then to secondary energy acceptors (Cy5 or NiB) gives rise to long&#8208;range and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence, especially NIR delayed emission (675&#8197;nm).







Abstract
An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded phosphorescence&#8208;capturing aggregate was constructed by multivalent co&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and amphipathic sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD). The initial dibromophthalimide derivative (G) generated a weak phosphorescent emission at 505&#8197;nm by host&#8211;guest interaction with CB[7], which further assembled with SC4AD to form homogeneously spherical nanoparticles with a dramatic enhancement of both phosphorescence lifetime to 1.13&#8197;ms and emission intensity by 40&#8208;fold. Notably, this G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD aggregate exhibited efficient phosphorescence energy transfer to Rhodamine B (RhB) and benzothiadiazole (DBT) with high efficiency (&#981;ET) of 84.4&#8201;% and 76.3&#8201;% and an antenna effect (AE) of 289.4 and 119.5, respectively, and then each of these can function as a bridge to further transfer their energy to second near&#8208;IR acceptors Cy5 or Nile blue (NiB) to achieve cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer. The final aggregate with long&#8208;range effect from 425&#8197;nm to 800&#8197;nm and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence was further employed as an imaging agent for multicolour cell labeling.

Structural snapshots and mechanistic investigation of a key spiroketal synthase provide insights into extensive oxidative backbone rearrangements and spiroketal pharmacophore assembly in rubromycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]&#8208;spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]&#8208;spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Our work illustrates an exceptional strategy for the biosynthesis of stable chroman spiroketals.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Dearomatization by Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation/Claisen Rearrangement: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirolactams</title>

A Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement is disclosed that involves an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds and allows the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of various valuable spirolactams. Moreover, the asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization is also achieved via kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis.







Abstract
Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a range of valuable spirolactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Importantly, an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds is involved in this tandem sequence. Moreover, an asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization was also achieved by efficient kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. In addition, the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement is shown to be kinetically preferred over the related [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement by theoretical calculations.

We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) inducer, which can specifically accumulate in cancer cell lysosomes for evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD) and converting immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors.







Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death induced by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) has recently attracted increasing attention. However, nearly no studies show that currently available LMP inducers can evoke immunogenic cell death (ICD) or convert immunologically cold tumors to hot. Herein, we report a LMP inducer named TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY, which can respond to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leading to formation of nanoassembies along with fluorescence and singlet oxygen turn&#8208;on. TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY tends to accumulate in ALP&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell lysosomes as well as induce LMP and rupture of lysosomal membranes to massively evoke ICD. Such LMP&#8208;induced ICD effectively converts immunologically cold tumors to hot as evidenced by abundant CD8+ and CD4+ T cells infiltration into the cold tumors. Exposure of ALP&#8208;catalyzed nanoassemblies in cancer cell lysosomes to light further intensifies the processes of LMP, ICD and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor conversion. This work thus builds a new bridge between lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ion Intercalation and High Volumetric Capacitance in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Porous Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27119-27125, December 20, 2021. </description>

A two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (Ni3BHT) demonstrates rapid and reversible intercalation of both cations and anions in an electrochemical capacitor (EC). This first observation of dual&#8208;ion intercalation in ECs presents a unique scenario, wherein cation intercalation in Ni3BHT is pseudocapacitive but anion intercalation is capacitive in nature.







Abstract
Intercalation is a promising ion&#8208;sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to the electrochemical surface area. It requires a rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material, and it must occur without phase transformations. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni3(benzenehexathiol) (Ni3BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni3BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.

         <title>Flower&#8208;Like Colloidal Particles through Precipitation Polymerization of Redox&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27026-27030, December 20, 2021. </description>

Flower&#8208;like particles of a redox&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline mixture prepared by precipitation polymerization are reported. The influences of monomer composition, polymerization temperature, and solvent on the particle shape are investigated. The shapes formed in the early stage of polymerization remain unchanged. Under reducing conditions, the flower&#8208;like particles are degraded much more rapidly than the spherical particles due to their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of monodisperse, flower&#8208;like, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles by precipitation polymerization of a LC mixture consisting of benzoic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylates and disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates. Introduction of a minor amount of redox&#8208;responsive disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates (&#8804;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) induced the formation of flower&#8208;like shapes. The shape of the particles can be tuned from flower&#8208; to disk&#8208;like to spherical by elevating the polymerization temperature. The solvent environment also has a pronounced effect on the particle size. Time&#8208;resolved TEM reveals that the final particle morphology was formed in the early stages of the polymerization and that subsequent polymerization resulted in continued particle growth without affecting the morphology. Finally, the degradation of the particles under reducing conditions was much faster for flower&#8208;like particles than for spherical particles, likely a result of their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27151-27157, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical hydroxyborate, NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), was constructed by a covalent bond modification strategy via a facile hydrothermal reaction. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH is SHG&#8208;active at both 1064&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm, with deep&#8208;UV transparency to wavelengths below 190&#8197;nm, and good phase&#8208;matchability in the near deep&#8208;UV region, a rare combination for NLO hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064&#8197;nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532&#8197;nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190&#8197;nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.

         <title>Rotation in an Enantiospecific Self&#8208;Assembled Array of Molecular Raffle Wheels</title>

A kagome network on the Ag(111) surface hosts guest molecules with enantiomeric selectivity. Each larger pore confines a single guest molecule. The punctuated pirouette of the guest molecule in this confined space is unravelled by a combination of density functional theory and variable temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy in real time at the single molecule level.







Abstract
Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic system&#8212;a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule&#8212;employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the chemically modified guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95&#8197;eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilises the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest's enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.

Safety is always a topic of concern after reports of devices catching fire due to battery failure. Using non&#8208;flammable electrolyte as an ultimate solution is difficult to be applied to commercial batteries because of various problems such as poor compatibility, high viscosity and so on. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with excellent comprehensive performance, and applied it to sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells with different promising materials.







Abstract
The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt;85&#8201;% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7&#8201;%).

         <title>Hyperbranched Microwire Networks of Organic Cocrystals with Optical Waveguiding and Light&#8208;Harvesting Abilities</title>

Hierarchical micro&#8208; and nanostructures made of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are not yet reported due to the weak control over intermolecular interactions and little&#8208;known complex assembly behavior of organic species. Hyperbranched microwire networks comprising binary organic arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals were created, which show optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of hyperbranched organic microwire (MW) networks comprising 1,4&#8208;bis(pentafluorostyryl)benzene (10Ft) and 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BA) using a simple solution co&#8208;assembly route. Pure 10Ft or BA assemblies cannot produce such complex MW networks; in contrast with a binary cocrystal of 10Ft and BA with a 2:1 molar ratio ((2:1)10Ft:BA), which is formed via intermolecular arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interactions. A new generation of multiple MWs grow epitaxially on the previous generation of MWs to form MW arrays in which BA may also act as an intermediate product to facilitate the regeneration of (2:1)10Ft:BA. Highly aligned and well&#8208;connected MW networks enable superior optical waveguiding ability. Moreover, a red&#8208;emitting dopant, 5,12&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN) was incorporated into (2:1)10Ft:BA host MWs, giving light&#8208;harvesting hierarchical MW networks via an energy&#8208;transfer (ET) process. The realization of the hyperbranched MWs provides us with deep insight into the rational creation of complex branched arrays from functional organic cocrystals.

         <title>Sink/Float Magnetic Immunoassays for In&#8208;Field Bioassays</title>

         <dc:description>
Sink/float magnetic immunoassays detect proteins, antibodies, and bacteria in samples using a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe protocol that uses a biofunctionalized small sphere, some liquid reagents and a small permanent magnet. A simple sink/float test of the sphere identifies if the analyte is above or below a predetermined level; the sphere sinks only if the analyte is above the concentration level.







Abstract
Analytical tests/devices that are used outside laboratory settings are required to have a very simple analytical protocol to get clearance by regulatory authorities. This study describes sink/float magnetic immunoassays, a new type of rapid, mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe, instrument&#8208;free tests for the detection of biomarkers in untreated biological samples that are very simple and might meet the simple&#8208;to&#8208;use criterion of authorities to be used in the field. These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8211;45&#8197;minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm&#8208;sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that uses reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C&#8208;Reactive Protein, anti&#8208;Treponema pallidum antibodies and E.&#8197;coli bacteria.

&lt;p&gt;Sink/float magnetic immunoassays detect proteins, antibodies, and bacteria in samples using a simple mix-and-observe protocol that uses a biofunctionalized small sphere, some liquid reagents and a small permanent magnet. A simple sink/float test of the sphere identifies if the analyte is above or below a predetermined level; the sphere sinks only if the analyte is above the concentration level.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Green Process to Synthesize MXene with Controllable Surface Terminations using Molten Salts</title>

This is the first study to use a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching (MS&#8208;E&#8208;etching) method to synthesize Ti3C2Cl2 without metallic impurities. The Tx surface terminations could be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S in this one&#8208;pot process. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx electrode exhibited a significant increase in capacity.







Abstract
Surface terminations of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti3C2Tx) considerably impact its physicochemical properties. Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8208;F surface terminations or metallic impurities in MXene. We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti3C2Cl2. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti3C2Cl2 product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, good rate performance (91.1&#8201;% at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), and excellent capacitance retention (100&#8201;% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), which is superior to multi&#8208;layered Ti3C2Tx prepared by other etching methods.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of a Rhombohedral Twelve&#8208;Connected Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Ordered Terephthalate and Fumarate Linkers</title>

The ordered arrangement of terephthalate and fumarate linkers over the fcu net produces a zirconium&#8208;based MOF Zr6(BDC)3(Fum)3 with two distinct windows and multiple guest diffusion pathways. This phase is formed by single&#8208;step synthesis in a narrow region of the available chemical space, and its identification required a large set of synthetic experiments that were facilitated by automated high&#8208;throughput methods.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8208;organic framework where an ordered array of two linkers with differing length and geometry connect [Zr6(OH)4O4]12+ clusters into a twelve&#8208;connected fcu net that is rhombohedrally distorted from cubic symmetry. The ordered binding of equal numbers of terephthalate and fumarate ditopic carboxylate linkers at the trigonal antiprismatic Zr6 core creates close&#8208;packed layers of fumarate&#8208;connected clusters that are connected along the single remaining threefold axis by terephthalates. This well&#8208;defined linker arrangement retains the three&#8208;dimensional porosity of the Zr cluster&#8208;based UiO family while creating two distinct windows within the channels that define two distinct guest diffusion paths. The ordered material is accessed by a restricted combination of composition and process parameters that were identified by high&#8208;throughput synthesis.

Through rational molecular design, simple chemical synthesis, and structure&#8211;property computation analysis, a new catholyte with high potential, two&#8208;electron transfer, and high solubility is developed for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries.







Abstract
This report describes the design of diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;phenothiazine hybrid catholytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries. The molecules are synthesized in a rapid and modular fashion by appending a diaminocyclopropenium (DAC) substituent to the nitrogen of the phenothiazine. Combining a versatile C&#8208;N coupling protocol (which provides access to diverse derivatives) with computation and structure&#8208;property analysis enabled the identification of a catholyte that displays stable two&#8208;electron cycling at potentials of 0.64 and 1.00&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ as well as high solubility in all oxidation states (&#8805;0.45&#8197;M in TBAPF6/MeCN). This catholyte was deployed in a high energy density two&#8208;electron RFB, exhibiting &gt;90&#8201;% capacity retention over 266&#8197;hours of flow cell cycling at &gt;0.5&#8197;M electron concentration.

         <title>Tailoring Co3d and O2p Band Centers to Inhibit Oxygen Escape for Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27102-27112, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode. The oxygen escape is significantly inhibited by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band centers and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping, which enables a stable cycling of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 delivers a high capacity but sharp fading is a critical issue, and the capacity decay mechanism is also poorly understood. Herein, we clarify that the escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2. We propose the inhibition of the oxygen escape for achieving stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band center and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping. This enhances the ionicity of the Co&#8722;O bond and the redox activity of Co and improves cation migration reversibility. The inhibition of oxygen escape suppresses the formation of Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 and maintains the surface structure integrity. Mg acts as a pillar, providing a stable and enlarged channel for fast Li+ intercalation/extraction. The modulated LiCoO2 shows almost zero strain and achieves a record capacity retention at 4.6&#8197;V: 92&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1C and 86.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5C.

&lt;p&gt;High-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivers a high capacity but sharp fading is a critical issue, and the capacity decay mechanism is also poorly understood. Herein, we clarify that the escape of surface oxygen and Li-insulator Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We propose the inhibition of the oxygen escape for achieving stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band center and enlarging their band gap with MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doping. This enhances the ionicity of the Co&#8722;O bond and the redox activity of Co and improves cation migration reversibility. The inhibition of oxygen escape suppresses the formation of Li-insulator Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and maintains the surface structure integrity. Mg acts as a pillar, providing a stable and enlarged channel for fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/extraction. The modulated LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows almost zero strain and achieves a record capacity retention at 4.6&#8197;V: 92&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1C and 86.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water Splitting by C60&#8208;Supported Vanadium Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27095-27101, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting of water by a single vanadium is greatly facilitated by a C60 support, which can be regarded as a small piece of porous carbon nanomaterials, especially those with intrinsic pentagonal defects and curvatures. The compelling experimental and theoretical evidence demonstrates the important role of support in single vanadium atom catalysis.







Abstract
Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60 supported vanadium atom, C60V++H2O&#8594;C60VO++H2. We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+, and observe the formation of H2 as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60&#8208;supported V+, whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+ ion by a high energy barrier. The C60 support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60 support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60&#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.

         <title>Spatial Structure Regulation: A Rod&#8208;Shaped Viologen Enables Long Lifetime in Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 26971-26977, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) anolyte for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs). R&#8208;Vi possesses a low membrane&#8208;penetration rate of &#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologens in AORFBs simultaneously. The R&#8208;Vi&#8208;based AORFB exhibits an extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous charging&#8211;discharging processes.







Abstract
A stable rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) derivative is developed through a spatial&#8208;structure&#8208;adjustment strategy for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). The obtained R&#8208;Vi features four individual methyl groups on the 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine core ring. The tethered methyls confine the movement of the alkyl chain as well as the sulfonic anion, thus driving the spatial structure from sigmoid to rod shape. The R&#8208;Vi with weak charge attraction and large molecular dimension displays an ultralow membrane permeability that is only 14.7&#8201;% of that of typical sigmoid viologen. Moreover, the electron&#8208;donating effect of methyls endows R&#8208;Vi with the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologen&#8208;based AORFBs. The AORFB with the R&#8208;Vi anolyte and a K4Fe(CN)6 catholyte exhibits an energy efficiency up to 87&#8201;% and extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous cycles.

Iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on an amorphous metal boride array are reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induces the formation of high&#8208;valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridges between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ 18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.

         <title>Oil&#8211;Water&#8211;Oil Triphase Synthesis of Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27078-27085, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on a phase engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs). A favourable reaction region with moderate monomer concentration is achieved in the middle water phase. The resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs show potential for ultrathin biogas separation membranes.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs) with long&#8208;range ordered and mono&#8208;dispersed ionic groups hold great potential in many advanced applications. Considering the inherent drawbacks of oil&#8211;water biphase method, herein, we explore an oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on phase engineering strategy for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of iCOFNs. The middle water phase serves as a confined reaction region, and the two oil phases are reservoirs for storing and supplying monomers to the water phase. A large aqueous space and low monomer concentration lead to the anisotropic gradual growth of iCOFNs into few&#8208;layer thickness, large lateral size, and high crystallinity. Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra&#8208;high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect&#8208;free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.

Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra-high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect-free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27031-27038, December 20, 2021. </description>

Quinones are used for quantitative UV/CD sensing of the concentration and enantiomeric excess of more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids. The integration of redox switching into the sensing protocol allows spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra that are obtained with challenging compound mixtures.







Abstract
(Pseudo)halogenated quinones react smoothly with chiral amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids toward push&#8211;pull conjugates with optical sensing and switching applications. The chiroptically active conjugates serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states with remarkably different UV and CD signatures. Addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone derivative that is quantitatively re&#8208;oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox switch system combines several attractive features such as simple set&#8208;up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, and thermal and photochemical stability. A conceptually new sensing approach that is based on integrated chiroptical amplification and redox switching enables on&#8208;the&#8208;fly deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for quantitative er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers in varying enantiomeric compositions.

         <title>Construction of Tricyclic Nitrogen Heterocycles by a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Allenynes and Application to Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>

The gold&#8208;catalyzed biscyclization of hydroxyisobutyryl (Hib)&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was promoted by BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to give 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives, some of which were converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A hexacyclic indolium salt (see structure) showed concentration&#8208;dependent photophysical properties attributable to aggregate formation.







Abstract
A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected biscyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to produce 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives in good yields. When the reaction was combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A newly obtained hexacyclic indolium salt showed characteristic concentration&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27158-27163, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals is obtained in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical cholesteric superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch, which derives from the different conversion ratio of Z/E photoisomerization of the switch upon different light irradiations.







Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 1 and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 2, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch 2, exposure of the system incorporating switch 1 to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch 1.

Abstract
Herein, we disclose osmaelectrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activations that set the stage for electrooxidative alkyne annulations by benzoic acids. The osmium electrocatalysis enables site&#8208; and chemoselective electrooxidative C&#8722;H activations with unique levels of selectivity. The isolation of unprecedented osmium(0) and osmium(II) intermediates, along with crystallographic characterization and analyses by spectrometric and spectroscopic in&#8197;operando techniques delineate a synergistic osmium redox catalyst regime. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed a facile C&#8722;H cleavage, which allows for an ample substrate scope, providing provide robust and user&#8208;friendly access to annulated heterocycles.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reaction to 1,4,2&#8208;Diazaborole&#8208;Type Heteroarene Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27053-27061, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction product between the bulky FmesBH2 borane and an isonitrile serves as a B/N frustrated Lewis pair that adds nitriles to form the dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole heteroarene derivatives. One example of this class of compounds was shown to undergo a cycloaddition reaction with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide.







Abstract
The borane FmesBH2 reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product.

     alt="Three-Component Reaction to 1,4,2-Diazaborole-Type Heteroarene Systems"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction product between the bulky FmesBH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; borane and an isonitrile serves as a B/N frustrated Lewis pair that adds nitriles to form the dihydro-1,4,2-diazaborole heteroarene derivatives. One example of this class of compounds was shown to undergo a cycloaddition reaction with N-phenylmaleimide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borane FmesBH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts in a three-component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro-1,4,2-diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN-indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro-1,4,2-oxaza- or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro-1,4,2-diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3-dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro-1,4,2-diazaborole derivative with N-phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;&#8208;Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals**
</title>

A crystalline carbazolylaluminylene with a monocoordinated aluminium atom featuring a lone pair of electrons and two vacant orbitals has been isolated at room temperature. The coordination behavior of this aluminylene towards transition metal centers is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene and alumanyl complexes with diverse coordination modes in a one&#8208;step process.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N&#8208;aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene 2&#8201;b. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of 2&#8201;b towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes 3&#8211;6 with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the tri&#8208;active ambiphilic Al center in 2&#8201;b can behave as: 1.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; 2.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating, &#963;&#8208;accepting and &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; and 3.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#963;&#8208;accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of 2&#8201;b with IDippCuCl (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu&#8208;alumanyl complex 8. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Nuclear&#8208;spin driven relaxation collaborating with the ligands in lanthanide single molecule magnets (SMMs) remains ambiguous. In their Communication on page&#8197;27282, Liviu Ungur, Jun&#8208;Liang Liu, and co&#8208;workers report two HoIII isotopic&#8208;isomorphic SMMs, whose magnetization dynamics reveals a switch in the relative relaxation rates at low/high temperatures. A theoretical analysis suggests that the noticeable isotope effect arises from the tunnel splitting and the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the distinct nuclear spin numbers of 1H and 2H.

Like well&#8208;manicured trees in nature, hyperbranched nanotrees are generated by sequential growth of multiple generations of aligned branches on the trunks, giving efficient light absorption and trapping. In their Research Article on page&#8197;27046, Yilong Lei and co&#8208;workers develop a solution co&#8208;assembly strategy to access ordered binary and ternary hyperbranched microwires comprising arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals, which display optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.

This Review describes recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven preparation of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. We hope to encourage the design of a facile and efficient route for molecular optoelectronic and flexible electronic applications.







Abstract
Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by the assembly of either a single molecule or an ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis, which is often termed &#8220;molecular electronics&#8221;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules, which offer additional scope to create ultrafast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular thin&#8208;films on suitable electrodes, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique has emerged as highly efficient. In this Review we describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential driven growth of nanometric various molecular films on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena.

High&#8208;entropy alloys offer a huge variety of multielement active sites on a single catalytic surface. This special polyelemental arrangement implies several different fundamental concepts in structure&#8211;activity correlations compared to traditional electrocatalysts, which are summarised and their implications for the possibility to adjust the catalytic properties with different limitations are discussed in detail.







Abstract
The formation of a vast number of different multielement active sites in compositionally complex solid solution materials, often more generally termed high&#8208;entropy alloys, offers new and unique concepts in catalyst design, which mitigate existing limitations and change the view on structure&#8211;activity relations. We discuss these concepts by summarising the currently existing fundamental knowledge and critically assess the chances and limitations of this material class, also highlighting design strategies. A roadmap is proposed, illustrating which of the characteristic concepts could be exploited using which strategy, and which breakthroughs might be possible to guide future research in this highly promising material class for (electro)catalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Triazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived FeN4Cl1 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Hierarchical Porosity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27324-27329, December 20, 2021. </description>

A Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic metal&#8208;triazolate framework (MET) modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole (dcIm) was used to prepare the Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst FeN4Cl1/NC. In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the catalyst offers fast mass transfer and high catalytic activity because of abundant mesopores (pore:volume ratio 0.92), a high Fe loading (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%), and defined FeN4Cl1 sites with a distinct electronic structure.







Abstract
The construction of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high single atom densities, favorable electronic structures and fast mass transfer is highly desired. We have utilized metal&#8208;triazolate (MET) frameworks, a subclass of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high N content, as precursors since they can enhance the density and regulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites, as well as generate abundant mesopores simultaneously. Fe single atoms dispersed in a hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix with high metal content (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and a FeN4Cl1 configuration (FeN4Cl1/NC), as well as mesopores with a pore:volume ratio of 0.92, were obtained via the pyrolysis of a Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic MET modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole. FeN4Cl1/NC exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Cl can optimize the adsorption free energy of Fe sites to *OH, thereby promoting the ORR process. The catalyst demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This strategy selects, designs, and adjusts MOFs as precursors for high&#8208;performance SACs.

The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH binds with high affinity to respiratory complex I, thereby blocking NADH oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species. The tight interaction is mediated by residues conserved in complex I but lacking in other enzymes containing a Rossmann&#8208;fold. Accordingly, it is a lead structure for the development of new drugs for fighting oxygen stress.







Abstract
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nanomolar concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR spectroscopy have failed. Here, by using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, we report the structure of NADH&#8208;OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues that are specific and essential for binding NADH&#8208;OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH&#8208;OH towards the unique Rossmann&#8208;fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH&#8208;OH acts as a lead&#8208;structure for the synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.

         <title>Precise Spatial&#8208;Designed Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Energy Transfer and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27258-27263, December 20, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), especially MOF nanosheets (NS), are very good candidates for photocatalysis. In this work, two types of donor&#8211;acceptor MOF NSs were prepared, including an acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS and a donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS. It was found that the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS type has very good performance even with fewer catalytic centres. This may help future research to design photocatalysts.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy&#8208;transfer process (EnT) to increase charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H4TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties, respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, the donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process as well as a high degree of site isolation. Two templates, donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS and acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS catalysts, were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts.

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Hybrid Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanosheets of Phase Pure n=2: Stabilized Colloids Stored in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27312-27317, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confined nanosheets (NSs) of 3D perovskites with a thickness of two lead halide layers can be prepared by using the dodecylammonium/tosylate ligand pair. The addition of Eu&#8208;nanodots to the colloid prevented the NSs from a structural rearrangement and/or coalescence. Deep blue&#8208;emissive colloids were recovered by simply dispersing it in toluene.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nano&#8208;nanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (n=2&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4&#8197;&#956;m lateral size and 2.5&#8197;nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440&#8197;nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (pTS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr2 nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.

A highly efficient, versatile and atom&#8208;economic protocol to chiral allylic phosphine oxides is demonstrated via palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of allenes with phosphine oxides. A family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrophosphinylation of alkyl and aryl&#8208;oxyallenes with phosphine oxides has been developed for the efficient and rapid construction of a family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups. This methodology was further applied in the facile construction of chiral 2H&#8208;chromene and later stage functionalization of cholesterol.

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27282-27287, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the nuclear&#8208;spin driven magnetization dynamics involving both metal ion and the ligand, for first time, in two HoIII isomorphic single&#8208;molecule magnets, where the behavior is originated from the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in nuclear spin number of protium (I=1/2) and deuterium (I=1).







Abstract
Here we reported the deuteration of the metal&#8208;binding equatorial water molecules in a reported HoIII single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry, from [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5]3+ to [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(D2O)5]3+. The hyperfine structures originating from the nuclear spin of 165HoIII can be clearly observed. Moreover, the resulting magnetization dynamics revealed the switch of the relative relaxation rates for the two isotope&#8208;isomorphic complexes&#8212;respectively faster/slower at low/high temperature. The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the ab initio calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (1H, I=1/2) and deuterium (2H, I=1).

The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the ab initio calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super-hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;=&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;=1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Redox Non&#8208;Innocence in Iron&#8211;Carbene Complexes {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11 by 1,2H and 13C Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27220-27224, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein are detailed 1/2H and 13C pulse EPR and DFT investigations of an S=1/2 terminal iron&#8211;carbene species. These studies reveal substantial spin density localized at the carbene&#8208;bound Fe center, in contrast with what has been reported to date for radical metal&#8211;carbenoid species. The {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 complex serves as a well&#8208;defined reference compound for comparison to data reported for in situ trapped intermediates.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a series of iron&#8208;carbene complexes in redox states {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11. Pulse EPR studies of the 1,2H and 13C isotopologues of {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 reveal the high covalency of the Fe&#8211;carbene bonding, leading to a more even spin distribution than commonly observed for reduced Fischer carbenes.

Two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and a n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI) are synthesized, and electron mobility of 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics are achieved by TP&#8208;DMBI doped films, which out&#8208;perform N&#8208;DMBI doped films.







Abstract
Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor&#8208;acceptor n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI), high electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP&#8208;DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8722;1.94&#8197;eV than that of the common dopant 4&#8208;(1, 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2, 3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N&#8208;DMBI) (&#8722;2.36&#8197;eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n&#8208;type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work. The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N&#8208;DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP&#8208;DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 than films with N&#8208;DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP&#8208;DMBI, and 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <dc:description>
A kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both, tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, and transition metal complexes.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphines have wide applications in asymmetric catalysis, materials, and pharmaceutical chemistry, however, their practical synthesis still constitutes a significant challenge. Herein, a successful kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1).

         <title>The Formal Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amines and Carboxylic Acids to Form sp3&#8211;sp3 Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27293-27298, December 20, 2021. </description>

An amine&#8211;carboxylic acid C&#8722;C coupling would be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions. Using miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation, we have developed the first amine&#8211;acid cross&#8208;coupling to form C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds based on preactivation of the building blocks and nickel catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed a deaminative&#8211;decarboxylative protocol to form new carbon(sp3)&#8211;carbon(sp3) bonds from activated amines and carboxylic acids. Amines and carboxylic acids are ubiquitous building blocks, available in broad chemical diversity and at lower cost than typical C&#8722;C coupling partners. To leverage amines and acids for C&#8722;C coupling, we developed a reductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling utilizing building block activation as pyridinium salts and redox&#8208;active esters, respectively. Miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation studies were critical to our reaction optimization, with subtle experimental changes such as order of reagent addition, composition of a binary solvent system, and ligand identity having a significant impact on reaction performance. The developed protocol is used in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceuticals while more than one thousand systematically captured and machine&#8208;readable reaction datapoints are reposited.

The developed protocol is used in the late-stage diversification of pharmaceuticals while more than one thousand systematically captured and machine-readable reaction datapoints are reposited.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I: Biosynthetic Origins of the Elusive Racemic Papaveraceae Isoxazolidine Alkaloids**

The first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I, an isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloid, is realized through a biomimetic strategy. The synthesis sheds light to the possible biosynthetic origins of these elusive natural product family members.







Abstract
The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloids Setigerumine&#8197;I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse&#8208;electron demand 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate. The work opens this previously inaccessible family of natural products for biological studies.

         <title>A Molecular Compound for Highly Selective Purification of Ethylene</title>

Structurally flexible, copper scorpionate binds ethylene extremely selectively from an ethylene&#8211;ethane mixture and displays excellent performance as a reusable material for the important and challenging C2H4/C4H6 separation.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from an C2H4 /C2H6 mixture is one of the most challenging separation processes, which is achieved mainly through energy&#8208;intensive, cryogenic distillation in industry. Sustainable, non&#8208;distillation methods are highly desired as alternatives. We discovered that the fluorinated bis(pyrazolyl)borate ligand supported copper(I) complex {[(CF3)2Bp]Cu}3 has features very desirable in an olefin&#8211;paraffin separation material. It binds ethylene exclusively over ethane generating [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4). This molecular compound exhibits extremely high and record ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) C2H4 /C2H6 gas separation selectivity, affording high purity (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) ethylene that can be readily desorbed from separation columns. In&#8208;situ PXRD provides a &#8220;live&#8221; picture of the reversible conversion between [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4) and the ethylene&#8208;free sorbent in the solid&#8208;state, driven by the presence or removal of C2H4. Molecular structures of trinuclear {[(CF3)2Bp]Cu}3 and mononuclear [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4) are also presented.

         <title>Direct, Site&#8208;Selective and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tetrahydrofurans via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, THF is activated by visible light irradiation of quantum dots in a direct, site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The resultant &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl radicals, generated from &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H of THF on the surface of QD, enable either coupling with the &#945;&#8208;amino radical of amines, or addition to chromones and terminal alkynes.







Abstract
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of THF via forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8722;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent.

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27195-27200, December 20, 2021. </description>

We present an isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, all isomers showed bright phosphorescence with an efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA scintillators showed bright luminescence under X&#8208;ray irradiation, which was ascribed to both excellent electrical conductivity and efficient suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while o&#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.

The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordinating group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs). A series of tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) were generated with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5&#8201;% ee, and with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Experimental Observation of Hydrocarbon Growth by Resonance&#8208;Stabilized Radical&#8211;Radical Chain Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Radical&#8211;radical chain reactions may contribute to rapid growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in combustion and astrochemical environments. Phenyl and benzyl radicals were experimentally observed to complete this chain reaction, producing diphenylmethyl and triphenylmethyl radicals by prompt H&#8208;atom loss (see scheme). This observation confirms the plausibility of such chain reactions at high temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
Rapid molecular&#8208;weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8211;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C6H5) and benzyl (c&#8208;C6H5CH2) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8211;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8211;1600&#8197;K) and low pressure (ca. 3&#8197;kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.

         <title>An Iridium Catalytic System Compatible with Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Sources for Dual Asymmetric Reductive Amination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27307-27311, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two successive asymmetric reductive aminations (ARAs) have been merged into one reaction system to generate enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amines. The iridium&#8208;phosphoramidite complex successfully manages the dual ARAs by using two distinctly different types of amine sources: an inorganic ammonium salt and an organic primary amine.







Abstract
Asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) is one of the most promising methods for the synthesis of chiral amines. Herein we report our efforts on merging two ARA reactions into a single&#8208;step transformation. Catalyzed by a complex formed from iridium and a steric hindered phosphoramidite, readily available and inexpensive aromatic ketones initially undergo the first ARA with ammonium acetate to afford primary amines, which serve as the amine sources for the second ARA, and finally provide the enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amine products. The developed process competently enables the successive coupling of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources with ketones in the same reaction system. The Br&#248;nsted acid additive plays multiple roles in this procedure: it accelerates the formation of imine intermediates, minimizes the inhibitory effect of N&#8208;containing species on the iridium catalyst, and reduces the primary amine side products.

A new perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation protocol debuts: Consecutive triple fluorinations of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) generate (CF3)3C&#8722; species, which enables efficient nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation of various electrophiles. The C(CF3)3&#8208;containing products can be successfully applied in 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging.







Abstract
Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF3)3C&#8722; species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated product was successfully applied in 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.

The generation of FSO2 radicals under electrochemical conditions is reported. Various sulfonyl fluorides and heterocycles, including a novel oxathiazole dioxide heterocycle, can be obtained in good to excellent yields. Some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives showed potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.







Abstract
Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO2 radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides or &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

&lt;p&gt;Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of &#946;-keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo-fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (&#946;-keto sulfonyl fluorides or &#945;-chloro-&#946;-keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The &#946;-keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some &#946;-keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against &lt;i&gt;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum gloeosporioides&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme Catalysis in Non&#8208;Native Environment with Unnatural Selectivity Using Polymeric Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27189-27194, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic random copolymers were employed to construct enzyme nanoreactors for catalysis in an organic solvent. Unnatural selectivity over a range of substrates was introduced by tuning the cross&#8208;linking density.







Abstract
The utilization of enzymes for catalysis in organic solvents, while exhibiting selectivity to different substrates, is a big challenge. We report an amphiphilic random copolymer system that self&#8208;assembles with enzymes in an organic solvent to form nanoreactors. These encapsulated enzymes are not denatured and they do preserve the catalytic activity. The cross&#8208;linkable functional groups in the hydrophobic compartments of the polymers offer to control accessibility to the enzyme. This varied accessibility due to the polymer host, rather than the enzyme itself, endows the nanoreactor with an unnatural selectivity. The findings here highlight the significant potential of simple polymer&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors to execute selective organic reactions under non&#8208;native conditions.

         <title>Stable Singlet Carbenes as Organic Superbases</title>

Pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA), can be more basic than Verkade proazaphosphatrane and even Schwesinger phosphazene P4(tBu). With these results it is demonstrated that carbenes should not be overlooked as neutral purely organic superbases.







Abstract
A simple experimental procedure for scaling carbene Br&#248;nsted basicity is described. The results highlight the strong basicity of pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbene, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA). They are more basic (pKaH &gt;42.7 in acetonitrile) than the popular proazaphosphatrane Verkade bases, and even the Schwesinger phosphazene superbase P4(tBu). The basicity of these compounds can readily be tuned, and they are accessible in multigram quantities. These results open new avenues for carbon centered superbases.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Nitrene by Silylenes without Using a Reducing Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27206-27211, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncharged univalent and reactive nitrene is captured and stabilized by silylenes. Two nitrene compounds are synthesized and fully characterized. The nitrene character was established by X&#8208;ray analysis, first&#8208;principles electronic structure studies using density functional theory, and natural bond orbital&#8208;based bonding analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;incorporated R1LSi&#8208;N&#8592;SiLR2 (1) [L=PhC(NtBu)2; R1=NTMS2, R2=NTMS]. Compound 1 is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 3.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at low temperature to afford a triene&#8208;like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 2.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at room temperature produced silaimine 2 with a central four&#8208;membered Si2N2 ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment. 1 further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound 3 which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds 1 and 2 were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds 1 and 2 have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.

         <title>Combined Precursor Engineering and Grain Anchoring Leading to MA&#8208;Free, Phase&#8208;Pure, and Stable &#945;&#8208;Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites for Efficient Solar Cells</title>

Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based additives in precursor solutions suppressed the formation of the undesired &#948; phase during the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskites, and heat&#8208;induced permeation of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide (tBBAI) into inner perovskite grains stabilized the &#945; structure. Solar cells assembled from this material exhibited improved power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. The incorporation of volatile FA&#8208;based additives in the precursor solutions completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized when 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide is permeated into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained &#8776;90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after storage at 50&#8201;&#176;C for over 1600&#8197;hours.

         <title>Precatalyst&#8208;Enabled Selectivity: Enantioselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed anti&#8208;Hydrometalative Cyclization of Alkynones to Endo&#8208; and Heterocyclic Allylic Alcohols</title>

An unprecedented NiH&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and anti&#8208;selective intramolecular coupling of alkynones to construct O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;containing endocyclic allylic alcohols was developed. The choice of metal precursors plays a key role in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. This study offers a new anti&#8208;hydrocyclization mode for enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyclization of alkynones with unparalleled anti&#8208; and endocyclic selectivities is described. The choice of the precatalysts has significant influence in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Using Ni(OTs)2/Phox as a precatalyst and (EtO)2MeSiH as a hydride source, an array of enantioenriched O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing heterocyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are obtained in 24&#8211;81&#8201;% yields with 80:20&#8211;99:1 er. Mechanistic investigations and synthetic application are also carried out. This study represents an efficient access to a set of allylic alcohols that are unable to access by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coupling reactions.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27264-27270, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.







Abstract
Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine as a Reagent for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27178-27183, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a biocatalytic approach to the production of fluorinated compounds, halide methyltransferases (HMTs) were found to form fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Although too unstable for isolation, fluorinated SAM was accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) to enable the fluoromethylation of small molecules (see scheme).







Abstract
Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. Herein we introduce S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;S&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of small molecules.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: Shedding Light on Nano&#8211;Bio Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) has been advancing in biomedicine over the past decade. Its recent integration with nuclear medicine imaging has broadened our understanding of the bio&#8208;interfacing of FNAs. In this Minireview, we survey and discuss nuclear imaging of FNAs in&#8197;vivo with the aim of highlighting outstanding questions on nano&#8211;bio interactions and potential directions for translation.







Abstract
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8211;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for studies on nano&#8211;bio interactions and allows scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of recent progress with FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8211;bio interfacing.

     alt="Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: Shedding Light on Nano&#8211;Bio Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) has been advancing in biomedicine over the past decade. Its recent integration with nuclear medicine imaging has broadened our understanding of the bio-interfacing of FNAs. In this Minireview, we survey and discuss nuclear imaging of FNAs in&#8197;vivo with the aim of highlighting outstanding questions on nano&#8211;bio interactions and potential directions for translation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8211;Crick base-pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for studies on nano&#8211;bio interactions and allows scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure-activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of recent progress with FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8211;bio interfacing. We summarize the biological profiles and immune responses of various FNAs as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts to apply FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this Minireview can bring up-to-date information on FNAs and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Biobased Synthesis of Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient strategy was developed for the environmentally benign conversion of furfural into polymer building blocks, maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, using photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation, hydrolysis and metathesis. The method offers high yielding steps with excellent selectivity while integrating multiple principles of green chemistry.







Abstract
Petrochemical based polymers, paints and coatings are cornerstones of modern industry but our future sustainable society demands greener processes and renewable feedstock materials. A challenge is to access platform monomers from biomass resources while integrating the principles of green chemistry in their chemical synthesis. We present a synthesis route starting from biomass&#8208;derived furfural towards the commonly used monomers maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, implementing environmentally benign photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation and ethenolysis reactions. Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85&#8201;% (2 steps) and 81&#8201;% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.

         <title>MOF Encapsulating N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Ligated Copper Single&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst towards Efficient Methane Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;ligated Cu SAS as the active site, accompanied by many micro&#8208;nano reactors, synergistically promotes the electrochemical synthesis of methane.







Abstract
The exploitation of highly efficient carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) electrocatalyst for methane (CH4) electrosynthesis has attracted great attention for the intermittent renewable electricity storage but remains challenging. Here, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;ligated copper single atom site (Cu SAS) embedded in metal&#8211;organic framework is reported (2Bn&#8208;Cu@UiO&#8208;67), which can achieve an outstanding Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81&#8201;% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE with a current density of 420&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70&#8201;% within a wide potential range and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3&#8197;s&#8722;1. The &#963; donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates. The porosity of the catalyst facilitates the diffusion of CO2 to 2Bn&#8208;Cu, significantly increasing the availability of each catalytic center.

         <title>Designer Outer Membrane Protein Facilitates Uptake of Decoy Molecules into a Cytochrome P450BM3&#8208;Based Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of amino acid derivatives as decoy molecules has been developed. Co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 enabled the Escherichia coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene with the assistance of decoy molecules. Moreover, whole&#8208;cell&#8208;catalysed stereoselective hydroxylation was achieved by changing the decoy molecule.







Abstract
We report an OmpF loop deletion mutant, which improves the cellular uptake of external additives into an Escherichia coli whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. Through co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 in the presence of decoy molecules, the yield of the whole&#8208;cell biotransformation of benzene could be considerably improved. Notably, with the decoy molecule C7AM&#8208;Pip&#8208;Phe the yield duodecupled from 5.7&#8201;% to 70&#8201;%, with 80&#8201;% phenol selectivity. The benzylic hydroxylation of alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes was also examined, and with the aid of decoy molecules, propylbenzene and tetralin were converted to 1&#8208;hydroxylated products with 78&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (R) ee for propylbenzene and 92&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (S) ee for tetralin. Our results suggest that both the decoy molecule and substrate traverse the artificial OmpF channel, synergistically boosting whole&#8208;cell bioconversions.

         <title>Entropy Versus Enthalpy Controlled Temperature/Redox Dual&#8208;Triggered Cages for Selective Anion Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage 1P, which selectively encapsulates BPh4&#8722; over a wide range of temperatures, can be quantitatively oxidized to cage 1PO with more negative enthalpy (&#916;H&#176;) and entropy (&#916;S&#176;) that releases the captured BPh4&#8722; anions at high temperature but strongly encapsulates BPh4&#8722; at low temperature.







Abstract
New C3&#8208;symmetric imidazole ligands were designed with phosphine and phosphine oxide linkers (LP and LPO, respectively) to demonstrate a dual&#8208;triggered dynamic closed coordination cage. Both LP and LPO form discrete Zn4L4&#8208;closed cages (1P and 1PO, respectively) with excellent selectively for BPh4&#8722;, whereas 1P and 1PO encapsulate neither a slightly larger size anion [B(C6H4CH3)4&#8722;] nor smaller size anions (BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, SbF6&#8722;, and OSO2CF3&#8722;). 1PO exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343&#8197;K) (trigger 1: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1PO
1PO+BPh4&#8722;). In contrast 1P has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298&#8197;K to 343&#8197;K). The 1P cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the 1PO cage by a mild oxidant (Ox.=H2O2), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1P+Ox.&#8594;1PO+BPh4&#8722;).

&lt;/b&gt; with more negative enthalpy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;H&#176;&lt;/i&gt;) and entropy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;S&#176;&lt;/i&gt;) that releases the captured BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions at high temperature but strongly encapsulates BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;PO&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343&#8197;K) (trigger 1: BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8834;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;PO&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;PO&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;+BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298&#8197;K to 343&#8197;K). The &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;PO&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; cage by a mild oxidant (Ox.=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the nature of M+, the hydrides of the H2Cu11 reactant behave differently. In the cases of M=Cu or Ag, they act as regular 2&#8208;electron ligands yielding [CuH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3]+ (Cu12H2), [AgH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6((C&#8801;CPh)6]+ (AgH2Cu14); in the case of M=Au, they behave as electron donors to form [AuCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3Cl] (AuCu11). Details of the study are presented by Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113266).

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Inspired Fragment Merging and Growing Affords Efficacious LasB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient fragment merging and growing strategy with simple chemistry yielded a fragment&#8208;like inhibitor of the virulence factor LasB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a twelve&#8208;fold boost in activity. Our optimized structure shows an improved in vivo efficacy demonstrating the significance of exploiting alternative binding modes to succeed in simple fragment merging. The graphic was created with the software tool BioRender (biorender.com).







Abstract
Extracellular virulence factors have emerged as attractive targets in the current antimicrobial resistance crisis. The Gram&#8208;negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the virulence factor elastase&#8197;B (LasB), which plays an important role in the infection process. Here, we report a sub&#8208;micromolar, non&#8208;peptidic, fragment&#8208;like inhibitor of LasB discovered by careful visual inspection of structural data. Inspired by the natural LasB substrate, the original fragment was successfully merged and grown. The optimized inhibitor is accessible via simple chemistry and retained selectivity with a substantial improvement in activity, which can be rationalized by the crystal structure of LasB in complex with the inhibitor. We also demonstrate an improved in vivo efficacy of the optimized hit in Galleria mellonella larvae, highlighting the significance of this class of compounds as promising drug candidates.

         <title>Sortase&#8208;Mediated Multi&#8208;Fragment Assemblies by Ligation Site Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) of multiple peptide fragments is enabled by ligation site switching. An active sorting motif installed by default into the ligation product is switched from an active to an inactive state while a latent nucleophile in the ligation product is activated for SML. Repetitive cycles of SML and ligation site switching allow the assembly of multiple fragments with wild type sortase.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a powerful tool of protein chemistry allowing the ligation of peptides containing LPxTG sorting motifs and N&#8208;terminal glycine nucleophiles. The installation of a sorting motif into the product prohibits the assembly of multiple fragments by SML. Here we report multi&#8208;fragment SML based on switchable sortase substrates. Substitution of the Leu residue by disulfide&#8208;containing Cys(StBu) results in active sorting motifs, which are inactivatable by reduction. In combination with a photo&#8208;protected N&#8208;Gly nucleophile, multi&#8208;fragment SML is enabled by repetitive cycles of SML and ligation site switching. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept four&#8208;fragment ligation, the assembly of peptide probes for bivalent chromatin binding proteins and oligomerization of peptide antigens. Biochemical and immuno&#8208;assays demonstrated functionality of these probes rendering them promising tools for immunology and chromatin biochemistry.

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clip&#8208;off chemistry represents a new synthetic methodology based on the rational cleavage of reticular materials. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111228), Inhar Imaz, Daniel Maspoch et&#8197;al. report that, in reticular materials,&#160;the cleavage of bonds can be quantitative and selective,&#160;effective both in solid&#8208;phase and solution&#8208;phase chemistry,&#160;and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal fashion. This chemistry is first used to synthesize two 3&#8208;D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from precursor reticular materials.

         <title>Controlling the Complexity and Interconversion Mechanisms in Self&#8208;assembled [Fe2L3]4+ Helicates and [Fe4L6]8+ Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled coordination cages and metal&#8208;organic frameworks have relied extensively on symmetric ligands in their formation. Here we have prepared a relatively simple system employing an unsymmetric ligand that results in two distinct self&#8208;assembled structures, a [Fe  2  L  3  ]  4+  helicate and a [Fe  4  L  6  ]  8+  cage composed of 10 interconverting diastereomers and their enantiomers. We show that the steric profile of the ligand controls the complexity, thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversion of the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Indomethacin Polymorph &#948; Revealed to be Two Plastically Bendable Crystal Forms by 3D Electron Diffraction: Correcting a 47&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Misunderstanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indomethacin is a clinically classical non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;&#8208;indomethacin cannot be cultivated as a large single crystal suitable for X&#8208;ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;&#8208;indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt&#8208;crystallized and solution&#8208;crystallized &#948;&#8208;indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs. This discovery and correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that 3D electron diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific Conjugation of a Selenopolypeptide to Alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin Enhances Oxidation Resistance and Pharmacological Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin (A1AT), a native serine&#8208;protease inhibitor which protects tissue damages from excessive protease activities, is&#160;used as an augmentation therapy to treat A1AT&#8208;deficienct patients. However, A1AT is sensitive to oxidation&#8208;mediated deactivation and has a short circulating half&#8208;life. Currently, there is no method that can effectively protect therapeutic proteins from oxidative damage  in vivo  . Here we developed a novel biocompatible selenopolypeptide and site&#8208;specifically conjugated it with A1AT. The conjugated A1AT fully retained its inhibitory activity on neutrophil elastase, enhanced oxidation resistance, extended the serum half&#8208;life, and afforded long&#8208;lasting protective efficacy in a mouse model of acute lung injury. These results demonstrated that conjugating A1AT with the designed selenopolymer is a viable strategy to improve its pharmacological properties, which could potentially further be applied to a variety of oxidation sensitive biotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeted synthesis of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, especially those with non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated sulfates, has experienced considerable difficulties due to the need to reconcile the oft&#8208;competing requirements for deep&#8208;UV transparency and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). We report herein the designed synthesis of the first rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV sulfate La(NH4)(SO4)2 by a double&#8208;salt strategy involving introduction of complementary cations, together with optical studies that reveal a short&#8208;wavelength deep&#8208;UV absorption edge (below 190 nm) and the strongest SHG response among deep&#8208;UV NLO sulfates (2.4 &#215; KDP). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis suggest that the excellent balance between SHG response and deep&#8208;UV transparency can be attributed to a synergistic interaction of the hetero&#8208;cations La3+ and [NH4]+, which optimize alignment of the [SO4] tetrahedra and highly polarizable [LaO8] polyhedra.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reconstructed Cu2P2O7 Catalyst for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical in&#8197;situ reconstruction of Cu2P2O7 during CO2 electroreduction generates highly porous Cu with abundant defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites, which facilitate CO adsorption with bridge and atop configurations, thus resulting in a high&#8208;rate production of C2+ fuels and chemicals.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over Cu&#8208;based catalysts shows great potential for converting CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) fuels and chemicals. Herein, we introduce an A2M2O7 structure into a Cu&#8208;based catalyst through a solid&#8208;state reaction synthesis method. The Cu2P2O7 catalyst is electrochemically reduced to metallic Cu with a significant structure evolution from grain aggregates to highly porous structure under CO2RR conditions. The reconstructed Cu2P2O7 catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 73.6&#8201;% for C2+ products at an applied current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkably higher than the CuO counterparts. The reconstructed Cu2P2O7 catalyst has a high electrochemically active surface area, abundant defects, and low&#8208;coordinated sites. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that CO adsorption with bridge and atop configurations is largely improved on Cu with defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites, which decreased the energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling reaction for C2+ products.

         <title>Reductive Alkylation of Alkenyl Acetates with Alkyl Bromides by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reaction between alkenyl acetates and alkyl bromides was achieved by reductive nickel catalysis. This method offers very mild reaction conditions for facile and precise synthesis of structurally versatile aliphatic alkenes using readily available and stable alkenyl reagents. It allows for a gram&#8208;scale reaction and modification of biologically active molecules, and it affords access to useful building blocks.







Abstract
Catalytic alkylation of stable alkenyl C&#8722;O electrophiles is synthetically appealing, but studies to date have typically focused on the reactions with alkyl Grignard reagents. We report herein a cross&#8208;electrophile reaction of alkenyl acetates with alkyl bromides. This work has enabled a new method for the synthesis of aliphatic alkenes from alkenyl acetates to be established that can be used to add more structural complexity and molecular diversity with enhanced functionality tolerance. The method allows for a gram&#8208;scale reaction and modification of biologically active molecules, and it affords access to useful building blocks. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the NiI species plays an essential role for the success of the coupling of these two reactivity&#8208;mismatched electrophiles.

         <title>Nitridic Analogs of Micas AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE=Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitridic analogs of micas, AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE=Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr), have been prepared under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. These compounds expand the structural diversity of nitrides to mineral analogous structures, accommodating the high&#8208;pressure motif of sixfold coordinated Si. The luminescence properties of Eu2+&#8208;doped samples were investigated and narrow&#8208;band emission was revealed with emission maxima ranging from 451&#8197;nm to 492&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We present the first nitridic analogs of micas, namely AESi3P4N10(NH)2 (AE=Mg, Mg0.94Ca0.06, Ca, Sr), which were synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400&#8201;&#176;C and 8&#8197;GPa from the refractory nitrides P3N5 and Si3N4, the respective alkaline earth amides, implementing NH4F as a mineralizer. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopic (EDX) mapping with atomic resolution, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and solid&#8208;state NMR. The structures consist of typical tetrahedra&#8211;octahedra&#8211;tetrahedra (T&#8208;O&#8208;T) layers with P occupying T and Si occupying O layers, realizing the rare motif of sixfold coordinated silicon atoms in nitrides. The presence of H, as an imide group forming the SiN4(NH)2 octahedra, is confirmed by SCXRD, MAS&#8208;NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from deep blue to cyan (451&#8211;492&#8197;nm).

         <title>Diazapentabenzocorannulenium: A Hydrophilic/Biophilic Cationic Buckybowl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exceeds one: Diazapentabenzocorannulenium, a cationic corannulene derivative bearing an internal imidazolium core, was prepared by a bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy. The introduction of positive charge and two nitrogen atoms into corannulene resulted in remarkable molecular properties, such as the formation of charge&#8208;segregated one&#8208;dimensional columns, high dispersibility in water, and selective introduction into the mitochondria of tumor cells.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic molecules are promising functional materials for a wide range of applications, especially in organic electronics. However, their largely hydrophobic nature has impeded further applications. As such, imparting high solubility/hydrophilicity to polycyclic aromatic molecules leads to a breakthrough in this research field. Herein, we report the synthesis of diazapentabenzocorannulenium, a cationic nitrogen&#8208;embedded buckybowl bearing a central imidazolium core, by a bottom&#8208;up strategy from polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide. X&#8208;ray crystallography analyses have revealed a bowl&#8208;shaped molecular structure that is capable of forming charge&#8208;segregated one&#8208;dimensional columns by bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl packing. In addition to its fluorescence capabilities and high dispersibility in water, the molecule was found to selectively localize in the mitochondria of various tumor cells, showing potential as viable mitochondria&#8208;selective fluorescent probes.

         <title>A Bright, Renal&#8208;Clearable NIR&#8208;II Brush Macromolecular Probe with Long Blood Circulation Time for Kidney Disease Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bright NIR&#8208;II brush macromolecular fluorophores (FBP) with high renal&#8208;clearance efficiency and long&#8208;blood circulation time has been developed. These achieve real&#8208;time in vivo NIR&#8208;II imaging of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury, tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.







Abstract
Early detection of kidney disease is of vital importance due to its current prevalence worldwide. Fluorescence imaging, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has been regarded as a promising technique for the early diagnosis of kidney disease due to the superior resolution and sensitivity. However, the reported NIR&#8208;II organic renal&#8208;clearable probes are hampered by their low brightness (&#1013;max&#934;f&gt;1000&#8197;nm&lt;10&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and limited blood circulation time (t1/2&lt;2&#8197;h), which impede the targeted imaging performance. Herein, we develop the aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) brush macromolecular probes (Fudan BDIPY Probes (FBP 912)) with high brightness (&#1013;max&#934;f&gt;1000&#8197;nm&#8776;60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is about 10&#8208;fold higher than that of previously reported NIR&#8208;II renal&#8208;clearable organic probes. FBP 912 exhibits an average diameter of &#8776;4&#8197;nm and high renal clearance efficiency (&#8776;65&#8201;% excretion through the kidney within 12&#8197;h), showing superior performance for non&#8208;invasively diagnosis of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (RIR) earlier than clinical serum&#8208;based protocols. Additionally, the high molecular weight polymer brush enables FBP 912 with prolonged circulation time (t1/2&#8776;6.1&#8197;h) and higher brightness than traditional PEGylated renal&#8208;clearable control fluorophores (t1/2&lt;2&#8197;h), facilitating for 4T1 tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.

         <title>Structural Elucidation of Cryptic Algaecides in Marine Algal&#8208;Bacterial Symbioses by NMR Spectroscopy and MicroED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging method MicroED was used in combination with NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the structures of eight novel and unusual alkaloids produced by the marine bacterial symbiont Phaeobacter inhibens when it is challenged with algal metabolites. Four of these molecules exhibited algaecidal activity, indicating that the bacteria can combine algal precursors to produce complex, hybrid natural products that kill the algal host.







Abstract
Microbial secondary metabolite discovery is often conducted in pure monocultures. In a natural setting, however, where metabolites are constantly exchanged, biosynthetic precursors are likely provided by symbionts or hosts. In the current work, we report eight novel and architecturally unusual secondary metabolites synthesized by the bacterial symbiont Phaeobacter inhibens from precursors that, in a native context, would be provided by their algal hosts. Three of these were produced at low titres and their structures were determined de novo using the emerging microcrystal electron diffraction method. Some of the new metabolites exhibited potent algaecidal activity suggesting that the bacterial symbiont can convert algal precursors, tryptophan and sinapic acid, into complex cytotoxins. Our results have important implications for the parasitic phase of algal&#8208;bacterial symbiotic interactions.

         <title>Functional Characterization and Protein Engineering of a Triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosyltransferase Reveal a Conserved Residue Critical for the Regiospecificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#180;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant&#160;Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O,&#160;and 2&#180;&#8208;O&#160;glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the&#160;C&#8208; and&#160;O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Molten Salt Synthesis of Platinum Alloys Planted in Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Graphene for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fuel cells are considered as a promising alternative to the existing traditional energy systems towards sustainable future. Nevertheless, the synthesis of efficient and robust Pt&#8208;based catalysts remains a challenge for practical applications. In this work, we present a simple and scalable molten&#8208;salt synthesis method for producing a low&#8208;platinum (Pt) nanoalloy implanted in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;graphene. The as&#8208;prepared low&#8208;Pt alloyed graphene exhibits a high oxygen reduction activity of 1.29 A mgPt&#8208;1 and excellent durability over 30,000 potential cycles. The catalyst nanoarchitecture of graphene encased Pt nanoalloy provides a robust capability against nanoparticle migration and corrosion due to strong metal&#8208;support interaction. Similarly, advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations show that the multiple active sites in platinum alloyed graphene synergistically account for improved oxygen reduction. This work not only provides an efficient and robust low&#8208;Pt catalyst but also a facile design idea and scalable preparation technique for integrated catalysts to achieve more profound applications in fuel cells and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by&#160;in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of dynamic crystal (  1  ), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two face elasticity (within ~ 1 % strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at r.t. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at ~ 105 &#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction,  &#181;  &#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure&#8208;function relationship of plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalyst, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating Co&#8208;MOFNs catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selective C&#8211;F bond functionalization of perfluoalkyl units has huge potential towards accessing functionalized organofluorinated compounds, but remains chanllenging due to the high C&#8211;F bond strength and inherent selectivity challenges. We report a new catalytic approach for the selective functionalization of the strong C&#8211;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides. This simple reaction proceeds in mild and operationally fashion with divergent conversions, including hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenlylation, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowires through a silica&#8208;protected strategy for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and stable Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is an effective way to promote the large&#8208;scale application of fuel cells. Pt&#8208;based alloy nanowires are a class of promising ORR catalyst, but their practical application has been hampered by the serious activity loss caused by structural destruction during long&#8208;term cycling operation. Herein, the successful preparation of ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowire catalysts with an average diameter of 2.6 nm and face&#8208;centered tetragonal structure is reported (denoted as fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C). Silica&#8208;protected strategy was used to prevent the shape deformation of PtFeIr nanowires during phase transition process at high temperature. The as&#8208;prepared fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C exhibited superior mass activity for ORR (2.03 A mg  Pt  &#8208;1  ) than disordered PtFeIr nanowires with face&#8208;centered cubic structure (1.11 A mg  Pt  &#8208;1  ) and commercial Pt/C (0.21 A mg  Pt  &#8208;1  ). Importantly, the structure and electrochemical performance of fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C were maintained well after stability tests, highlighting the advantages of ordered structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A moderately hydrophilic MOF of UiO&#8208;67&#8208;4Me&#8208;NH2&#8208;38&#8201;% with high thermal, hydrolytic and acid&#8208;base stability has been obtained by a pore&#8208;nanospace post&#8208;engineering strategy, which shows ideal S&#8208;shaped water&#8208;sorption isotherm, high water&#8208;uptake working capacity and efficiency in the ASHRAE recommended humidity range, and prior capture ability of harmful organic and inorganic vapors, providing a promising candidate for autonomous indoor humidity control and air purification.







Abstract
The indoor air quality is of prime importance for human daily life and health, for which the adsorbents like zeolites and silica&#8208;gels are widely used for air dehumidification and harmful gases capture. Herein, we develop a pore&#8208;nanospace post&#8208;engineering strategy to optimize the hydrophilicity, water&#8208;uptake capacity and air&#8208;purifying ability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with long&#8208;term stability, offering an ideal candidate with autonomous multi&#8208;functionality of moisture control and pollutants sequestration. Through variant tuning of organic&#8208;linkers carrying hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the pore&#8208;nanospaces of prototypical UiO&#8208;67, a moderately hydrophilic MOF (UiO&#8208;67&#8208;4Me&#8208;NH2&#8208;38&#8201;%) with high thermal, hydrolytic and acid&#8208;base stability is screened out, featuring S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherms exactly located in the recommended comfortable and healthy ranges of relative humidity for indoor ventilation (45&#8201;%&#8211;65&#8201;% RH) and adverse health effects minimization (40&#8211;60&#8201;% RH). Its exceptional attributes of water&#8208;uptake working capacity/efficiency, contaminants removal, recyclability and regeneration promise a great potential in confined indoor environment application.

         <title>An Activatable Afterglow/MRI Bimodal Nanoprobe with Fast Response to H2S for In Vivo Imaging of Acute Hepatitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2S&#8208;activatable NIR afterglow/MRI bimodal nanoprobe F1&#8208;GdNP is designed, which shows fast reaction kinetics, high sensitivity and specificity toward H2S, offering a remarkable &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow luminescence and strong &#8220;always on&#8221; MRI signal for reliable detection of hepatic H2S and H2S production&#8208;relevant enzyme (CSE) with high SBR and spatial&#8208;resolution.







Abstract
Accurate detection of hepatic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to monitor H2S&#8208;related enzymes&#8217; activity is critical for acute hepatitis diagnosis, but remains a challenge due to the dynamic and transient nature of H2S. Here, we report a H2S&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared afterglow/MRI bimodal probe F1&#8208;GdNP, which shows an &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; MRI signal and &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow signal toward H2S. F1&#8208;GdNP shows fast response, high sensitivity and specificity toward H2S, permitting afterglow imaging of H2S and evaluation of cystathionine &#947;&#8208;lyase (CSE)&#8217;s activity in living mice. We further employ the high spatial&#8208;resolution MRI signal of F1&#8208;GdNP to track its delivery and accumulation in liver. Importantly, F1&#8208;GdNP offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR=86.2&#177;12.0) to sensitively report on the increased hepatic H2S level in the acute hepatitis mice via afterglow imaging, which correlated well with the upregulated CSE activity in the liver, showcasing the good potential of F1&#8208;GdNP for monitoring of acute hepatitis process in vivo.

         <title>Creating Dynamic Nanospaces in Solution by Cationic Cages as Multirole Catalytic Platform for Unconventional C(sp)&#8722;H Activation Beyond Enzyme Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of permeable porous&#8208;cage nanospaces in solution by a highly charged cationic [Pd6(RuL3)8]28+ cage for multirole and multi&#8208;way supramolecular catalysis is reported.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate that, based on the creation of dynamic nanospaces in solution by highly charged positive coordination cage of [Pd6(RuL3)8]28+, multirole and multi&#8208;way cage&#8208;confined catalysis is accomplishable for versatile functions and anomalous reactivities with the aid of the biomimetic cage effect. The high cationic&#8208;host charges drive partial deprotonation of 24 imidazole&#8208;NHs on cage sphere alike imidazole&#8208;residuals in proteins, generating amphoteric heterogeneity in solution to enforce effective cavity&#8208;basicity against solution&#8208;acidity. Synergistic actions arisen from cage hydrophobicity, host&#8208;guest electrostatic interactions and imidazole&#8208;N coordination facilitate C(sp)&#8722;H activation and carbanionic intermediate stabilization of terminal alkynes to achieve unusual H/D&#8208;exchange and Glaser coupling under acidic conditions, and enable phase transfers of water&#8208;insoluble substrates/products/co&#8208;catalysts to make immiscible&#8208;phase and bi&#8208;phase catalysis feasible, thus providing a useful catalytic protocol to combine merits from homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic and phase transfer catalysis.

         <title>Modular Two&#8208;Step Access to &#960;&#8208;Extended Naphthyridine Systems&#8212;Potent Building Blocks for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent modular two&#8208;step approach to naphthyridine&#8208;based polyaromatic compounds was achieved through gold catalysis followed by acid&#8208;mediated condensation and in situ desulfonation. Besides the halochromic behaviour of all synthesised &#960;&#8208;extended systems, one example shows outstanding sensitivity in detecting protons in non&#8208;protic solvents and allows a quantitative analysis in the low &#956;m area.







Abstract
Efficient synthetic approaches for the incorporation of nitrogen into polyaromatic compounds (PACs) in different patterns as stabilising moiety for &#960;&#8208;extended systems and modification tool for optoelectronic properties remain a challenge until today. Herein, we developed a new versatile pathway to napthyridine&#8208;based PACs as non&#8208;symmetric and regioisomeric pendant to pyrazine&#8208;based PACs. A combination of a gold&#8208;catalysed synthesis of 2&#8208;aminoquinolines and the development of an in situ desulfonation and condensation of these precursors are the key steps of the protocol. The shape and type of attached functional groups of the PACs can be designed in a late stage of the overall synthetic procedure by the chosen anthranile and backbone of the ynamide introduced in the gold&#8208;catalysed step. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the investigation of electronic properties of the compounds show the influence of the attached substituents. All naphthyridine&#8208;based PACs show halochromic behaviour implying their use as highly sensitive proton sensor in non&#8208;protic solvents.

         <title>Interface Chelation Induced by Pyridine&#8208;Based Polymer for Efficient and Durable Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite solar cell (PSC) has emerged rapidly in the field of flexible photovoltaics. A self&#8208;healing polysiloxane (SHP) polymer with pyridine&#8208;based heterocyclic structures and plenty of dynamic hydrogen bonds was utilized to passivate and heal the cracks at grain boundaries. A champion efficiency of 19.50&#8201;% was achieved and the PSC with SHP recovered 80&#8201;% of original efficiency after self&#8208;healing for 2&#8197;h in ambient atmosphere.







Abstract
Polymer doping is a significant approach to precisely control nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites and enhance electronic quality in perovskite solar cells (PSC) prepared in air. Here, a brand&#8208;new self&#8208;healing polysiloxane (SHP) with dynamic 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide (PDCA) coordination units and plenty of hydrogen bonds was designed and incorporated into perovskite films. PDCA units, showing strong intermolecular Pb2+&#8208;Namido, I&#8722;&#8208;Npyridyl, and Pb2+&#8208;Oamido coordination interactions, were expected to enhance crystallinity and passivate the grain boundary. In addition, abundant hydrogen bonds in SHP afforded the self&#8208;healing of cracks at grain boundaries for fatigue PSCs. Significantly, the doped device demonstrated a champion efficiency of 19.50&#8201;% with inconspicuous hysteresis, almost rivaling those achieved in control atmosphere. This strategy of heterocyclic&#8208;based macromolecular doping in PSCs will pave a way for realizing efficient and durable crystalline semiconductors.

         <title>Cooperative Luminescence and Cooperative Sensitisation Upconversion of Lanthanide Complexes in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative luminescence and cooperative sensitization are observed for the first time in solution at the molecular scale with nona&#8208;nuclear clusters containing nine Yb atoms or a mixture of Yb and Tb ones. The cooperative sensitization upconversion processes in the mixed clusters were systematically investigated, showing the best performances for equimolar amounts of Yb and Tb in the clusters and using deuterated solvents and ligands.







Abstract
Upconversion materials have led to various breakthrough applications in solar energy conversion, imaging, and biomedicine. One key impediment is the facilitation of such processes at the molecular scale in solution where quenching effects are much more pronounced. In this work, molecular solution&#8208;state cooperative luminescence (CL) upconversion arising from a Yb excited state is explored and the mechanistic origin behind cooperative sensitisation (CS) upconversion in Yb/Tb systems is investigated. Counterintuitively, the best UC performances were obtained for Yb/Tb ratios close to parity, resulting in the brightest molecular upconversion complexes with a quantum yield of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;6 at a low laser power density of 2.86&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Triplet Generation Promoted via Spiro&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;unity triplet generation is achieved in SCTs solution with the help of spiro&#8208;charge transfer state, which facilitates the triplet generation and inhibits other excited state relaxation pathways.







Abstract
An intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant of 1.0&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 was previously registered with a spiro&#8208;bis&#8208;benzophenone scaffold. Triplet generation efficiency could be further enhanced by stabilizing the spiro&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and rationally designing spiro&#8208;compounds (SCTs) that consist of electron&#8208;rich diphenyl ether as the spiro&#8208;CT donor and electron&#8208;deficient dinaphthyl ketone as the spiro&#8208;CT acceptor. Through fine&#8208;tuning of the energy level between the CT and high energy triplet states, near&#8208;unity triplet generation quantum yield was achieved and the underlying ISC mechanism is revealed by using ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Potential triplet sensitizing application was demonstrated in SCTs. Our findings suggest that a spiro&#8208;bichromophoric molecular system with an enhanced spiro&#8208;charge transfer warrants efficient triplet generation and is a powerful strategy of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet sensitizers with predictable ISC properties.

         <title>Direct Evidence of Subsurface Oxygen Formation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Cu by X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subsurface oxygen has been proposed to be crucial for oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) in electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this work, a high&#8208;resolution spectral feature of subsurface oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu was observed by in situ grazing incident hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Two types of subsurface oxygen were identified: oxygen staying at lattice defects (in green) and interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure (in blue).







Abstract
Subsurface oxygen has been proposed to be crucial in oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) electrocatalysts for enhancing the binding of CO intermediates during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the presence of such oxygen species under reductive conditions still remains debated. In this work, the existence of subsurface oxygen is validated by grazing incident hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where OD&#8208;Cu was prepared by reduction of Cu oxide with H2 without exposing to air. The results suggest two types of subsurface oxygen embedded between the fully reduced metallic surface and the Cu2O buried beneath: (i)&#8197;oxygen staying at lattice defects and/or vacancies in the surface&#8208;most region and (ii)&#8197;interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure. This study adds convincing support to the presence of subsurface oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, which previously has been suggested to play an important role to mitigate the &#963;&#8208;repulsion of Cu for CO intermediates in CO2RR.

         <dc:description>The practical application of&#160;lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries&#160;is still limited by the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs)&#160;shuttling effect on S cathode and uncontrollable Li&#8208;dendrite growth on Li anode.&#160;Herein, elaborately designed WSe2  &#160;flakelets immobilized on N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with abundant active sites are&#160;employed to be dual&#8208;functional host for satisfying both S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe2/NG with strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode,&#160;the WSe2/NG with excellent lithiophilic feature can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite.&#160;Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li&#8722;S full batteries&#160;exhibit remarkable&#160;rate performance&#160;and stable cycling stability&#160;even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2  &#160;with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P)&#160;ratio&#160;of 1.4:1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereo&#8208; and enantioselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling involving C&#8722;F bond activation has been reported. Treatment of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with racemic benzyl electrophiles in the presence of a chiral nickel complex using B  2  pin  2  as a stoichiometric reductant allows the construction of a C(sp  2  )&#8722;C(sp  3  ) bond under mild conditions, affording a broad range of monofluoroalkenes bearing stereogenic allylic centers. Initial mechanistic studies indicate that a radical chain pathway may be operating, wherein the ester group in the gem&#8208;difluoroalkene promotes C&#8722;F bond activation through oxidative addition to a Ni species.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Gelation on Disulfide Electrocatalysts in Lithium&#8210;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8210;sulfur (Li&#8210;S) batteries are highly regarded as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their superior theoretical energy density up to 2600 Wh kg&#8722;1. Cathodic polysulfide electrocatalysts have been widely investigated to promote the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and realize high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. Probing the surface structure of the electrocatalysts is of great significance to understanding the mechanism of polysulfide electrocatalysis and rationally designing advanced electrocatalysts. In this work, we for the first time identify surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries. Concretely, the Lewis acid sites on the disulfide electrocatalysts trigger the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) solvent to generate a surface gel layer, and the surface gel layer covers the disulfide electrocatalysts and renders reduced electrocatalytic activity. To address the above issue, a Lewis base triethylamine (TEA) is introduced to working Li&#8211;S batteries as a competitive inhibitor to suppress the surface gelation. Consequently, Li&#8211;S batteries with the disulfide electrocatalysts and the TEA inhibitor afford higher specific capacity, improved rate responses, and prolonged cycling lifespan. This work affords new insights on the surface structure of polysulfide electrocatalysts and inspires further investigation on surface structure regulation of polysulfide electrocatalysts in working Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Gut&#8208;Microbiota&#8208;Derived Lantibiotics Reveals a Subgroup of S8 Family Proteases for Class III Leader Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthipeptides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with diverse structural features and bioactivities. Gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived lanthipeptides play important roles in gut homeostasis of the host. Herein, we report the discovery and biosynthesis of class III lantibiotics named amylopeptins, which are derived from the gut microbiota of Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats and display a narrow antimicrobial spectrum. In contrast to known class III lanthipeptides, the biosynthesis of amylopeptins employs AmyP, which belongs to a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases, to remove the leader of corresponding precursor peptides in a site&#8208;specific manner during the last step of their maturation. Overall, this study shows for the first time that S8 family proteases participate in the biosynthesis of class III lanthipeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unusual Pair: Facile Formation and In Vivo Validation of Robust Sc&#8208;18F Ternary Complexes for Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 remains the most widely clinically utilized radionuclide globally for positron emission tomography (PET). The emergence of therapeutic isotopes for the management of disease has produced a pronounced interest in matched, theranostic isotope pairs that can be employed in tandem for the diagnosis and stratification of patients for subsequent radiotherapy. F&#8208;18 however does not have a suitable therapeutic isotopologue. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of Sc&#8208;  18  F ternary complexes is feasible under mild, aqueous conditions, producing chemically robust radiopharmaceuticals in high radiochemical yield and specific activity. A corresponding in vivo study with a cancer&#8208;targeting Sc&#8208;  18  F tracer indicates excellent in vivo stability and produces exquisite PET image quality, rendering the  18  F/  47  Sc isotope pair an unusual, yet chemically matched theranostic pair with excellent potential for clinical translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Gene Fusion and Directed Evolution to Break Structural Symmetry and Boost Catalysis by an Oligomeric C&#8208;C Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gene duplication and fusion are among the primary natural processes that generate new proteins from simpler ancestors. Here we adopted this strategy to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient biocatalyst for enantioselective Michael reactions. We first designed a tandem fused 4&#8208;OT to allow independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits by directed evolution. This fused 4&#8208;OT was then subjected to eleven rounds of directed evolution to give variant 4&#8208;OT(F11), which showed an up to 320&#8208;fold enhanced activity for the Michael addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehydes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that 4&#8208;OT(F11) has an unusual asymmetric trimeric architecture in which one of the monomers is flipped 180o relative to the others. This gene duplication and fusion strategy to break structural symmetry is likely to become an indispensable asset of the enzyme engineering toolbox, finding wide use in engineering oligomeric proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbene Strategy for Progressive (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroalkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrodefluorination is one of the most promising chemical strategies to degrade perfluorochemicals into partially fluorinated compounds. However, controlled progressive hydrodefluorination remains a significant challenge, owing to the decrease in the strength of C&#8211;F bonds along with the defluorination. Here we describe a carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl ketones under rhodium catalysis, allowing for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and even alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoro&#8208;alkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The reaction mechanism and the origin of the intriguing chemoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Broad&#8208;spectrum binding: New bivalent supramolecular reversal agents are formed by target templated synthesis in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic Super&#8208;sCx calixarene hosts form strong complexes to a variety of structurally diverse target neuromuscular blocking agents.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of bivalent water&#8208;soluble calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene hosts, Super&#8208;sCx4 and Super&#8208;sCx5 as new broad&#8208;spectrum supramolecular binders of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Synthesis was achieved using the target bisquaternary amine NMBAs as a template to link two highly anionic p&#8208;sulfonatocalixarene building blocks in aqueous solution. Bivalent anionic hosts Super&#8208;sCx4 and Super&#8208;sCx5 bind by engaging both quaternary amines present on a variety of NMBAs. We report low &#956;M binding to structurally diverse alkyl, steroidal, curarine and benzylisoquinoline NMBAs with high selectivity over the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a variety of other hydrophobic amines.

         <title>Photocatalytic gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination Reactions by a Formal C&#8722;C Coupling/Defluorination Reaction with Diazoacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amines unlock an unconventional reaction of diazoalkanes with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. Under photocatalytic conditions, no cyclopropanation occurs, instead a gem&#8208;difluoroolefin is formed via C&#8722;C bond formation and fluoride elimination.







Abstract
The photolysis of diazoalkanes to conduct singlet carbene transfer reactions of colored diazoalkanes has recently attracted significant interest in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a photocatalytic approach that allows the access of triplet carbene intermediates via energy transfer to conduct highly efficient gem&#8208;difluoroolefination reactions with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes. The use of a tertiary amines proved pivotal to unlock this unusual reaction pathway and to prevent undesired cyclopropanation pathways. The amine further facilitates the ultimate abstraction of fluoride to yield gem&#8208;difluoroolefins (43 examples, up to 88&#8201;% yield), which is supported by experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies. We explored this synthesis method with a broad substrate scope, ranging from simple olefins and heterocyclic olefins towards the decoration of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks.

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Bicycles: In Situ Access to Stable Constrained Peptides with Superior Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8211;bismuth bicycles are a new class of constrained peptides. Bismuth(III) is a selective and green reagent for the generation of stable and rigid bicycles from peptides with three cysteine residues. This biocompatible strategy allows in situ access to constrained peptides directly during screening campaigns and produces inhibitors of superior activity and proteolytic stability.







Abstract
Constrained peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We report here a fundamentally new strategy for the facile generation of bicyclic peptides using linear precursor peptides with three cysteine residues and a non&#8208;toxic trivalent bismuth(III) salt. Peptide&#8211;bismuth bicycles form instantaneously at physiological pH, are stable in aqueous solution for many weeks, and much more resistant to proteolysis than their linear precursors. The strategy allows the in situ generation of bicyclic ligands for biochemical screening assays. We demonstrate this for two screening campaigns targeting the proteases from Zika and West Nile viruses, revealing a new lead compound that displayed inhibition constants of 23 and 150&#8197;nM, respectively. Bicyclic peptides are up to 130&#8197;times more active and 19&#8197;times more proteolytically stable than their linear analogs without bismuth.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Synthesis of a [2]Catenane CoII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand 1,2&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene, H2L, self assembles with CoII to form {[Co4(H2L)6]8+} rectangles which mechanically interlock via self&#8208;assembly to form a [2]catenane. The catenated structure displays single&#8208;molecule magnetism (SMM), highlighting how mechanically interlocked systems can be used to arrange SMM centers in topologically complex arrays.







Abstract
We describe herein the self&#8208;assembly synthesis of an octanuclear CoII [2]catenane {[Co4(H2L)6]216+} formed by the mechanical interlocking of two {[Co4(H2L)6]8+} rectangles of unprecedented topology. Subtle manipulation of the synthetic conditions allows the isolation of a mixed&#8208;valence [Co2III/Co2II]10+ non&#8208;catenated rectangle. The CoII centers in the [2]catenane exhibit slow relaxation of their magnetic moment, i.&#8201;e. single&#8208;molecule magnet properties, dominated by quantum tunneling and Raman relaxation processes. This work shows that metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry can precisely control the organization of single&#8208;molecule magnets in topologically complex arrangements.

         <title>Production of Copolyester Monomers from Plant&#8208;Based Acrylate and Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route is developed to prepare PCTA monomer with plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The features include catalytic MBH reaction, one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction over H2SO4/SiO2 catalyst, and Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. In addition, commonly used plasticizer di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) benzenedicarboxylate and monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol can also be manufactured.







Abstract
PCTA is an important copolyester that has been widely used in our daily necessities. Currently, its monomers are industrially produced from petroleum&#8208;derived xylene. To reduce the reliance on fossil energy, we herein disclose an alternative route to access PCTA monomer (terephthalate/isophthalate=2.4/1) in 61&#8201;% overall yield using plant&#8208;based acrylate and acetaldehyde as the feedstocks. The process includes Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of acetaldehyde with acrylate, subsequent one&#8208;step dehydration/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with acrylate over H2SO4/SiO2 catalyst, and final Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation. Besides, when varying the final step to hydrogenation, another important monomer UNOXOL&#8482; diol (1,4&#8208;trans/1,4&#8208;cis/1,3&#8208;trans/1,3&#8208;cis=5.2/2/2.5/1) can be produced in 67&#8201;% overall yield.

         <title>Vectorial Catalysis in Surface&#8208;Anchored Nanometer&#8208;Sized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Microfluidic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling multiple reactions in a programmed manner and defined spatial localization is a key goal in catalysis, which is referred to as vectorial catalysis. We realized a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based vectorial catalysis system by anchoring two different nano&#8208;MOFs at precise spatial positions in the microfluidic device and tested their performance in the catalysis of a two&#8208;step reaction sequence.







Abstract
Vectorial catalysis&#8212;controlling multi&#8208;step reactions in a programmed sequence and by defined spatial localization in a microscale device&#8212;is an enticing goal in bio&#8208;inspired catalysis research. However, translating concepts from natural cascade biocatalysis into artificial hierarchical chemical systems remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate integration of two different surface&#8208;anchored nanometer&#8208;sized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a microfluidic device for modelling vectorial catalysis. Catalyst immobilization at defined sections along the microchannel and a two&#8208;step cascade reaction was conducted with full conversion after 30&#8197;seconds and high turnover frequencies (TOF&#8776;105&#8197;h&#8722;1).

         <title>Cobalt Single Atom Incorporated in Ruthenium Oxide Sphere: A Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for HER and OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single atom is incorporated in a RuO2 sphere through a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal process, as revealed by EXAFS, HRTEM, and AC&#8208;STEM. The Co single atoms could tailor the local electronic structure of the bifunctional electrocatalyst for high&#8208;performance HER and OER, which significantly reduces the energy barrier, and the catalyst shows the lowest overpotential of 45&#8197;mV for HER and 200&#8197;mV for OER at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The development of highly active and stable bifunctional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial goal for clean and renewable energy, which still remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient and stable catalyst comprising a Co single atom incorporated in an RuO2 sphere for HER and OER, in which the Co single atom in the RuO2 sphere was confirmed by XAS, AC&#8208;STEM, and DFT. This tailoring strategy uses a Co single atom to modify the electronic structures of the surrounding Ru atoms and thereby remarkably elevates the electrocatalytic activities. The catalyst requires ultralow overpotentials, 45&#8197;mV for HER and 200&#8197;mV for OER, to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The theoretical calculations reveal that the energy barriers for HER and OER are lowered after incorporation of a cobalt single atom.

         <title>Reversible Photoswitching between Fluorescence and Room Temperature Phosphorescence by Manipulating Excited State Dynamics in Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced reversible fluorescence (FL) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching in molecular aggregates was realized through repeatedly erasing and restoring the long&#8208;lived RTP under alternate ultraviolet and visible light exposure. The triplet excitons can be quenched via a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process.







Abstract
Regulation of fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence pathways in organic molecular aggregate remains a challenge due to the complicated singlet&#8211;triplet excited state dynamics process. Herein, we demonstrated a successful example (o&#8208;BFT) to realize photoreversible fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching based on an effective strategy of integrating a phosphor (dibenzofuran) with a photoswitch (dithienylbenzothiophene). o&#8208;BFT exhibited dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in both powder and doping polymer film. Notably, the long&#8208;lived RTP of o&#8208;BFT could be repeatedly erased and restored through reversible photocyclization and decyclization under alternate ultraviolet and visible photoirradiation. In&#8208;depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo&#8208;controlled triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light&#8208;activated o&#8208;BFT to photoisomer c&#8208;BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence&#8208;RTP switching.

&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced reversible fluorescence (FL) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching in molecular aggregates was realized through repeatedly erasing and restoring the long-lived RTP under alternate ultraviolet and visible light exposure. The triplet excitons can be quenched via a triplet-to-singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS-FRET) process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation of fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence pathways in organic molecular aggregate remains a challenge due to the complicated singlet&#8211;triplet excited state dynamics process. Herein, we demonstrated a successful example (o-BFT) to realize photoreversible fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switching based on an effective strategy of integrating a phosphor (dibenzofuran) with a photoswitch (dithienylbenzothiophene). o-BFT exhibited dual emission of fluorescence and RTP in both powder and doping polymer film. Notably, the long-lived RTP of o-BFT could be repeatedly erased and restored through reversible photocyclization and decyclization under alternate ultraviolet and visible photoirradiation. In-depth theoretical and spectroscopic investigations revealed that the triplet inactivation was dominated by a photo-controlled triplet-to-singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from light-activated o-BFT to photoisomer c-BFT. Yet, the initial fluorescence could be preserved in this process to afford a photoreversible fluorescence-RTP switching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Attached&#8208;Ring Synthesis via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions: A Short Formal Synthesis of Merrilactone A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control re&#8208; vs. si&#8208; facial selectivity en route to fully substituted attached&#8208;rings. This differential engagement of one rotational isomer of an attached&#8208;ring system leads to a short formal synthesis of merrilactone A.







Abstract
A strategy to control the diastereoselectivity of bond formation at a prochiral attached&#8208;ring bridgehead is reported. An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control re&#8208; vs. si&#8208; facial selectivity en route to fully substituted attached&#8208;rings. This divergency reflects differential engagement of one rotational isomer of the attached&#8208;ring system. The successful synthesis of an erythro subtarget diastereomer ultimately leads to a short formal synthesis of merrilactone A.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production via the Construction of Robust Multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalently connected multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF hybrid materials were constructed demonstrating outstanding photocatalytic H2 evolution performance with a maximum H2 evolution rate of 13.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (TOF=227&#8197;h&#8722;1), much higher than the prototypical counterparts.







Abstract
Titanium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ti&#8208;MOFs), as an appealing type of artificial photocatalyst, have shown great potential in the field of solar energy conversion due to their well&#8208;studied photoredox activity (similar to TiO2) and good optical responsiveness of linkers, which serve as the antenna to absorb visible&#8208;light. Although much effort has been dedicated to developing Ti&#8208;MOFs with high photocatalytic activity, their solar energy conversion performances are still poor. Herein, we have implemented a covalent&#8208;integration strategy to construct a series of multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF hybrid materials PdTCPP&#8834;PCN&#8208;415(NH2)/TpPa (composites 1, 2, and 3), featuring excellent visible&#8208;light utilization, a suitable band gap, and high surface area for photocatalytic H2 production. Notably, the resulting composites demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, especially for the composite 2 with a maximum H2 evolution rate of 13.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (turnover frequency (TOF)=227&#8197;h&#8722;1), which is much higher than that of PdTCPP&#8834;PCN&#8208;415(NH2) (0.21&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpPa (6.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our work thereby suggests a new approach to highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 evolution and beyond.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Activity of Phthalocyanine&#8211;Artesunate Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting aggregation&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic activity (AESA) effect was first observed based on the studies of phthalocyanine&#8211;artesunate conjugates and common organic sonosensitizers, which arose from boosted ultrasonic cavitation caused by nanostructured aggregates. We believed that the AESA effect in this work could open up a new avenue for the development of efficient sonosensitizers.







Abstract
The clinical prospect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has not been fully realized due to the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, we designed phthalocyanine&#8211;artesunate conjugates (e.g. ZnPcT4A), which could generate up to ca. 10&#8208;fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the known sonosensitizer protoporphyrin&#8197;IX. Meanwhile, an interesting and significant finding of aggregation&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic activity (AESA) was observed for the first time. ZnPcT4A showed about 60&#8208;fold higher sonodynamic ROS generation in the aggregated form than in the disaggregated form in aqueous solutions. That could be attributed to the boosted ultrasonic cavitation of nanostructures. The level of the AESA effect depended on the aggregation ability of sonosensitizer molecules and the particle size of their aggregates. Moreover, biological studies demonstrated that ZnPcT4A had high anticancer activities and biosafety. This study thus opens up a new avenue the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloids with surface patches (or patchy particles) can bind and assemble with directionality. However, the bonding between the usually high&#8208;symmetry, dome&#8208;shaped patches is not precise, as it cannot lock the exact position and orientation of the relevant particles. This issue prevents the assembly of well&#8208;defined colloidal superstructures by design. Herein, we introduce low&#8208;symmetry, metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based patchy colloids, which feature a polyhedral matrix and flat hexagonal patches, along with anisotropic surfaces and compositions. Guided by the encoded shape/chemical information and mediated by a site&#8208;selective liquid&#8208;bridging interaction, the distinct patchy particles self&#8208;assemble into supra&#8208;colloidal (or supra&#8208;framework) structures with unprecedented precision. In this case, the valence, position, and orientation of the particles within assemblies are fully coordinated and precisely aligned. The dynamic nature of the liquid bridges also allows us to investigate the unique assembly kinetics. Our strategy not only defines new modes of colloidal bonding, but also provides a powerful means toward creating hierarchical and multi&#8208;component MOF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Shearinines&#8197;D and G: A Convergent Approach to Indole Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly convergent total syntheses of (+)&#8208;shearinines&#8197;G and D, fungal metabolites with interesting bioactivities, were accomplished through late&#8208;stage coupling of two complex fragments. Intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of a diazo ketone established the central trans&#8208;hydrindane motif bearing two vicinal quaternary stereocenters, thus providing a new approach to alkaloids of this type.

The first total syntheses of the indole diterpenoids (+)&#8208;shearinine&#8197;G and D are disclosed. The successful routes rely on late&#8208;stage coupling of two complex fragments. Formation of the challenging trans&#8208;hydrindane motif was accomplished by diastereoselective, intramolecular cyclopropanation. A one&#8208;pot sequence consisting of Sharpless dihydroxylation/Achmatowicz reaction was developed to install the dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif. The indenone subunit was accessed by Prins cyclization. Tuning the electronic nature of the substituents on the parent arylcarboxaldehyde allowed access to divergent products that were further transformed into shearinines&#8197;G and D. Riley&#8208;type oxidation of a bicyclic enone yielded a surprising stereochemical outcome.

         <dc:description>The main protease (M  pro  ) and papain&#8208;like protease (PL  pro  ) play critical roles in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication and are promising targets for antiviral inhibitors. Simultaneous visualization of M  pro  and PL  pro  is extremely valuable for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and rapid inhibitor screening. However, such crucial investigation has remained challenging because the lack of suitable probes. Here we developed a dual&#8208;color probe named 3MBP5 for simultaneous detection of M  pro  and PL  pro  via fluorescence (or F&#246;rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). This probe produces fluorescence from both of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores cleaved by M  pro  and PL  pro  . 3MBP5 activatable specificity was demonstrated with recombinant proteins, inhibitors, plasmid transfected HEK 293T cells, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected TMPRSS2&#8208;Vero cells. Results from dual&#8208;probe first verified simultaneous detection and intracellular distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 M  pro  and PL  pro  . This is a powerful tool for simultaneous detection of different proteases with value in rapid screening of inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Monofluoroalkylation: Strategies for the Synthesis of Alkyl Fluorides by C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. Strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, but they have been studied less than strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;F bond formation (fluorination).







Abstract
Alkyl fluorides modulate the conformation, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and pKa of compounds containing aliphatic motifs and, therefore, have been valuable for medicinal chemistry. Despite significant research in organofluorine chemistry, the synthesis of alkyl fluorides, especially chiral alkyl fluorides, remains a challenge. Most commonly, alkyl fluorides are prepared by the formation of C&#8722;F bonds (fluorination), and numerous strategies for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorination have been reported in recent years. Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, they have been studied less than methods based on fluorination. This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. We expect this contribution will illuminate the potential of monofluoroalkylations to simplify the synthesis of complex alkyl fluorides and suggest further research directions in this growing field.

         <title>Regioselective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes by Cooperative Cu and Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual Cu/Ni catalytic system is identified for linear selective hydroalkylation of vinylarenes with complementary regioselectivities to similar catalytic systems. Turnover numbers (TONs) with respect to Ni are as high as 72, and Cu is revealed to accelerate the rate of formation of the linear alkyl nickel intermediate. Examples for the diversification of pharmaceuticals are also demonstrated.







Abstract
Disclosed here is a dual copper and nickel catalytic system with a silyl hydride source for promoting the linear selective hydroalkylation of vinylarenes. This carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming protocol is applied to couple a variety of functionalized vinylarenes with alkyl halides applying a nickel(II) NNN pincer complex in the presence of an NHC&#8208;ligated copper catalyst. This combination allows for a 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading of the nickel catalyst leading to turnover numbers of up to 72. Over 40 examples are presented, including applications for pharmaceutical diversification. Labeling experiments demonstrated the regioselectivity of the reaction and revealed that the copper catalyst plays a crucial role in enhancing the rate for formation of the reactive linear alkyl nickel complex. Overall, the presented work provides a complimentary approach for hydroalkylation reactions, whilst providing a preliminary mechanistic understanding of the cooperativity between the copper and nickel complexes.

         <title>Crystal plane is not the key factor for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methane electrosynthesis on reconstructed Cu2O microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu  2  O microparticles with controllable crystal planes and relatively high stability have been recognized as a good platform to understand the mechanism of electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). In this work, we demonstrate that the in&#8208;situ generated Cu  2  O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane formation, rather than the initial crystal plane of reconstructed Cu  2  O microparticles. Experimental results indicate that the methane evolution is dominated on all three different crystal planes with similar Tafel slope and long&#8208;term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that *CO is protonated via a similar bridge configuration at the Cu  2  O/Cu interface, regardless of the initial crystal planes of Cu  2  O. The Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of *CHO on different reconstructed Cu  2  O planes are close and more negative than that of *OCCOH, indicating the methane formation is more favorable than ethylene on all Cu  2  O crystal planes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;coordinated perovskite solar cell with open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 1.23 V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solution processed organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite films, the halide anion related defects including halide vacancy and interstitial defects can easily form at the surface and grain boundaries. The excess iodides would disturb the interfacial carrier transport, and the uncoordinated lead cations would produce defect levels within the bandgap, inducing nonradiative recombination, obvious hysteresis, and large energy loss. Here, polyacrylonitrile  (PAN)  was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. It was found that the coordinating ability of cyano group was stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination was conducive to reduce I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the polyacrylonitrile in the perovskite film, the device efficiency was improved from 21.58% to 23.71%, with the open circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12 V to 1.23 V, as well as enlarged ion migration activation energy and improved operational stability.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic In Vivo Methylation&#8208;Hydroamination of Bioderived Lignin Monomers to Generate a Key Precursor to L&#8208;DOPA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates can be derived from the depolymerisation of lignin feedstocks. Direct biotransformations of the hydroxycinnamic acid monomers obtained can be significantly increased to high&#8208;value chemicals, such as &#945;&#8208;amino acids, however the reaction is often hampered by the chemical autooxidation in alkaline or harsh reaction media. Regioselective  O  &#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in natural secondary metabolic pathways utilising an expensive co&#8208;substrate  S  &#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) as the methylating reagent altering the physicochemical properties of the hydroxycinnamic acids. In this study, we engineered an OMT to accept a variety of electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates, modified a commercial  E. coli  strain BL21 (DE3) to regenerate SAM  in vivo  , and combined it with an engineered ammonia lyase to partake in a one&#8208;pot, two whole cell enzyme cascade to produce the L&#8208;DOPA precursor L&#8208;veratrylalanine from lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Nanocomposite as Early Evaluation System of Therapy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delays in evaluating cancer response to radiotherapy (RT) usually reduce therapy effect or miss the right time for treatment optimization. Hence, exploring timely and accurate methods enabling to gain insights of RT response are highly desirable. In this study, we developed an apoptosis enzyme (caspase&#8208;3) activated nanoprobe for early evaluation of RT efficacy. The nanoprobe bridged the nanogapped gold nanoparticles (AuNNPs) and&#160;the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;fluorescent (FL) molecules (IR&#8208;1048) through a caspase&#8208;3 specific peptide sequence (DEVD) (AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048). After X&#8208;ray irradiation, caspase&#8208;3 was activated to cut DEVD, turning on both NIR&#8208;II FL and PA imaging signals. The increased NIR&#8208;II FL/PA signals exhibited positive correlation with the content of caspase&#8208;3. Moreover, the amount of the activated caspase&#8208;3 was negatively correlated with the tumor size. There results underscore the role of the caspase&#8208;3 activated by X&#8208;ray irradiation in bridging the imaging signals variation and tumor inhibition rate. Overall, activatable NIR&#8208;II FL/PA imaging was successfully used to timely predict and evaluate the RT efficacy. The evaluation system based on biomarker&#8208;triggered living imaging has the capacity to guide treatment decisions for numerous cancer types.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Conversion of Epoxides into Thiiranes: Mechanism, Stereochemical Model, and New Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report computations and experiments leading to new chiral phosphoric acids (CPA) for epoxide thionations. Density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of reported CPA&#8208;catalyzed epoxide thionations. The calculated mechanistic information was used to design new efficient CPAs that were tested experimentally and found to be highly effective. Bulky  ortho  &#8208;substituents on the 3,3&#8217;&#8208;aryl groups of the CPA are important to restrict the position of the epoxide in the key transition states for the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Larger  para  &#8208;substituents significantly improve the enantioselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistically Inspired Halenium Ion Initiated Spiroketalization: Entry to Mono&#8208; and Dibromospiroketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Employing halenium affinity (  HalA  ) as a guiding tool, the weak nucleophilic character of alkyl ketones was modulated by templating effect of a tethered THP&#8208;protected alcohol towards realizing a bromenium ion initiated spiroketalization cascade. Addition of ethanol aided an early termination of the cascade by scavenging the THP group after the halofunctionalization stage, furnishing mono&#8208;bromospiroketals. Alternatively, exclusion of ethanol from the reaction mixture biased the oxocarbenium towards&#160;  a  &#8208; deprotonation &#160;that precedes a second bromofunctionalization event thus, furnishing dibrominated spiroketals. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity exploited in the current methodology provides a novel and rapid access to the dibrominated spiroketals motifs exhibited by several natural products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a universal boronate&#8208;affinity crosslinking&#8208;amplified dynamic light scattering (DLS) immunoassay for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) glycoprotein detection in complex samples. This enhanced DLS immunoassay consists of two elements,  i.e.  , antibody&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNP@mAb) for target capture and DLS signal transduction, and phenylboronic acid&#8208;based boronate affinity materials as crosslinking amplifiers. Upon the addition of targets, glycoproteins are first captured by MNP@mAb and amplified by target&#8208;induced crosslinking stemmed from the selective binding between the boronic acid ligand and  cis  &#8208;diol&#8208;containing glycoprotein, thereby resulting in a remarkably increased DLS signal in the average nanoparticle size. Benefiting from the multivalent binding and fast boronate affinity reaction between glycoproteins and crosslinkers, the proposed immunosensing strategy has achieved the ultrasensitive and rapid quantitative assay of glycoproteins at the fM level within 15 min. Overall, this work provides a promising and versatile design strategy for extending the DLS technique to detect glycoproteins even in the field or at POC.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Excited State Chirality of Dynamic Chemical Reaction in Chiral Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality generation and transfer is not only critical importance in resolving the origin of biological homochirality, but also is of great significance for exploring the chirality&#8208;related functionalities in nanomaterials and supramolecular systems. Although modulating the ground state chirality in chiral nanomaterials has been widely demonstrated, it remains a big challenge to steer the excited state chirality (circularly polarized luminescence, CPL). Herein, we present a kind of chiral spherical micelles constructed by chiral cationic gemini surfactants, whose surfaces and cavities could co&#8208;assemble with hydrophilic and hydrophobic emitters concurrently. Subsequently, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic emitters could be endowed with CPL activity in the aqueous phase. Additionally, the cavities of such micelles can be regarded as the powerful chiral confined space, which could effectively modulate the excited state chirality of dynamic chemical reaction, enabling color&#8208;adjustable CPL emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Prediction of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Guest Accessibility from Linker and Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The choice of metal and linker together define the structure and therefore the guest accessibility of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), but the large number of possible metal&#8208;linker combinations makes the selection of components for synthesis challenging. We predict the guest accessibility of a MOF with 80.5% certainty based solely on the identity of these two components as chosen by the experimentalist, by decomposing reported experimental three&#8208;dimensional MOF structures in the Cambridge Structural Database into metal and linker and then learning the connection between the components&#8217; chemistry and the MOF porosity. Pore dimensions of the guest&#8208;accessible space are classified into four ranges with three sequential models. Both the dataset and the predictive models are available to download and offer simple guidance in prioritization of the choice of the components for exploratory MOF synthesis for separation and catalysis based on guest accessibility considerations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Peptide and Protein Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents are commonly used for the development of novel transformations. As they are highly reactive and biocompatible, they have been employed more recently for the functionalization of biomolecules. This Minireview discusses the development of hypervalent iodine reagents for the modification of peptides and proteins as well as their application, such as for labeling and peptide stapling.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds are powerful reagents for the development of novel transformations. As they exhibit low toxicity, high functional group tolerance, and stability in biocompatible media, they have been used for the functionalization of biomolecules. Herein, we report recent advances up to June 2021 in peptide and protein modification using hypervalent iodine reagents. Their use as group transfer or oxidizing reagents is discussed in this Minireview, including methods targeting polar, aromatic, or aliphatic amino acids and peptide termini.

         <title>Thermal and Magnetic Field Switching in a Two&#8208;Step Hysteretic MnIII Spin Crossover Compound Coupled to Symmetry Breakings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new MnIII compound shows stepwise spin crossover (SCO) with two thermally hysteretic steps coupled to symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transitions. The superposition of two types of symmetry breakings leads to a rich interplay between structural and magnetic properties and stabilizes an unusual intermediate phase with four independent MnIII sites. Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin state switching at unprecedentedly low DC fields (onset &lt;5&#8197;T) is observed.







Abstract
A MnIII spin crossover complex with atypical two&#8208;step hysteretic thermal switching at 74&#8197;K and 84&#8197;K shows rich structural&#8211;magnetic interplay and magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin state switching below 14&#8197;T with an onset below 5&#8197;T. The spin states, structures, and the nature of the phase transitions are elucidated via X&#8208;ray and magnetization measurements. An unusual intermediate phase containing four individual sites, where 
 are in a pure low spin state, is observed. The splitting of equivalent sites in the high temperature phase into four inequivalent sites is due to a structural reorganization involving a primary and a secondary symmetry&#8208;breaking order parameter that induces a crystal system change from orthorhombic&#8594;monoclinic and a cell doubling. Further cooling leads to a reconstructive phase transition and a monoclinic low&#8208;temperature phase with two inequivalent low&#8208;spin sites. The coupling between the order parameters is identified in the framework of Landau theory.

         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a straightforward, robust, and simple route to access &#946;&#8208;substituted desaturated cyclic amines via an electrochemically driven desaturative &#946;&#8208;functionalization of cyclic amines. This transformation is based on multiple single&#8208;electron oxidation processes using catalytic amounts of ferrocene. The reaction proceeds in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of electrolyte under mild conditions, affording the desired products with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction was tolerant of a broad range of substrates and also enables late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of potentially valuable products. Prelininary mechanistic studies using cyclic voltammetry reveal the key role of ferrocene as a redox mediator in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathespin B&#8208;Initiated Cypate Nanoparticle Formation for Tumor Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a lysosomal protease that is overexpressed in the early stage of many cancer types. Precise evaluation of CTSB expression in vivo may provide a promising method for the early diagnosis of cancers. By virtue of the high&#8208;resolution PA imaging modality, a &#8220;smart&#8221; photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate&#8208;CBT, which can self&#8208;assemble to cypate&#8208;containing nanoparticles in response to abundant GSH and CTSB inside tumor cells, was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of CTSB activity. Compared with unmodified Cypate, our probe Cypate&#8208;CBT exhibited a 4.9&#8208;fold or 4.7&#8208;fold PA signal enhancement in CTSB&#8208;overexpressing MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells or tumors, respectively, revealing intracellular accumulation of the probe after CTSB&#8208;initiated self&#8208;assembly. We expect Cypate&#8208;CBT to be employed as an effective PA imaging agent for clinical diagnosis of cancer at early stages.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a lysosomal protease that is overexpressed in the early stage of many cancer types. Precise evaluation of CTSB expression in vivo may provide a promising method for the early diagnosis of cancers. By virtue of the high-resolution PA imaging modality, a &#8220;smart&#8221; photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate-CBT, which can self-assemble to cypate-containing nanoparticles in response to abundant GSH and CTSB inside tumor cells, was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of CTSB activity. Compared with unmodified Cypate, our probe Cypate-CBT exhibited a 4.9-fold or 4.7-fold PA signal enhancement in CTSB-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells or tumors, respectively, revealing intracellular accumulation of the probe after CTSB-initiated self-assembly.

         <title>What Distinguishes the Strength and the Effect of a Lewis Acid: Analysis of the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What is the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett number? An experimental and theoretical evaluation of factors that determine the 31P&#8197;NMR shifts of binding of 130 Lewis acids to triethylphosphine oxide allows linking the strength of a Lewis acid (global Lewis acidity) with the effect of a Lewis acid (effective Lewis acidity).







Abstract
IUPAC defines Lewis acidity as the thermodynamic tendency for Lewis pair formation. This strength property was recently specified as global Lewis acidity (gLA), and is gauged for example by the fluoride ion affinity. Experimentally, Lewis acidity is usually evaluated by the effect on a bound molecule, such as the induced 31P&#8197;NMR shift of triethylphosphine oxide in the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett (GB) method. This type of scaling was called effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Unfortunately, gLA and eLA often correlate poorly, but a reason for this is unknown. Hence, the strength and the effect of a Lewis acid are two distinct properties, but they are often granted interchangeably. The present work analyzes thermodynamic, NMR specific, and London dispersion effects on GB numbers for 130 Lewis acids by theory and experiment. The deformation energy of a Lewis acid is identified as the prime cause for the critical deviation between gLA and eLA but its correction allows a unification for the first time.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amides via Highly Chemoselective N&#8211;C&#160;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although cross&#8208;coupling reactions of amides by selective N&#8211;C cleavage are one of the most powerful and burgeoning areas in organic synthesis due to the ubiquity of amide bonds, the development of mechanochemical, solid state methods remain a major challenge. Herein, we report the first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8211;C bond activation. The method is conducted in the absence of external heating, for short rection time and shows excellent chemoselectivity for s N&#8211;C bond activation. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs and sequential orthogonal cross&#8208;couplings exploiting double solvent&#8208;less solid&#8208;state methods. The results further mechanochemical reaction environments to advance the chemical repertoire of N&#8211;C bond interconversions to solid&#8208;state environmentally&#8208;friendly mechanochemical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallization&#8208;Prompted Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under the topological guidance, the self&#8208;assembly process based on tetratopic porphyrin synthon results in a HOF with the predicted square layers topology (sql) but unsatisfied stability. Strikingly, simply introducing transition metal in porphyrin center does not change the network topology but drastically causes noticeable change on noncovalent interaction, orbital overlap, and molecular geometry, therefore ultimately giving rise to a series of metalloporphyrinic HOFs with high surface area, and excellent stability (intact after being soaked in boiling water, concentrated HCl, and heated in 270 oC). With integrating both photosensitizers and catalytic sites into robust backbones, this series of HOFs can effectively catalyze the photoreduction of CO2 to CO, and their catalytic performances greatly depend on the chelated metal species in porphyrin centers. This work enriches the library of stable functional HOFs and expands their applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Regioisomeric Space and Visible Color Range of Purely Organic Dual Emitters with Ultralong Phosphorescence Components: From Violet to Red Towards Pure White Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative set of twelve highly luminescent dual emitters based on benzensulfone moieties selectively attached to dibenzofurane is presented. These compounds can cover the whole visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and even behave as single&#8208;source white light emitters. They show ultralong phosphorescent afterglow at room temperature, based on the positioning of the sulfone moieties.







Abstract
We mapped the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum and achieved white light emission (CIE: 0.31, 0.34) by combining the intrinsic ns&#8208;fluorescence with ultralong ms&#8208;phosphorescence from purely organic dual emitters. We realized small molecular materials showing high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;L) in the solid state at room temperature, achieved by active exploration of the regioisomeric substitution space. Chromophore stacking&#8208;supported stabilization of triplet excitons with assistance from enhanced intersystem crossing channels in the crystalline state played the primary role for the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. This strategy covers the entire visible spectrum, based on organic phosphorescent emitters with versatile regioisomeric substitution patterns, and provides a single molecular source of white light with long lifetime (up to 163.5&#8197;ms) for the phosphorescent component, and high overall photoluminescence quantum yields (up to &#934;L=20&#8201;%).

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state copper catalysis enables the synthesis of more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs.







Abstract
Heterocycles are one of the largest groups of organic moieties with significant medicinal, chemical, and industrial applications. Herein, we report the discovery and development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, synergistic excited&#8208;state copper catalysis using a combination of Cu(IPr)I as a catalyst and rac&#8208;BINAP as a ligand, which produces more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs. Preliminary mechanistic investigation suggests in situ generations of [Cu(BINAP)2]+ and [Cu(IPr)2]+ catalysts that work cooperatively under visible&#8208;light irradiation to facilitate catalytic carbo&#8208;aroylation of unactivated alkenes, affording a wide range of useful heterocycles.

         <title>Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry For Modular Synthesis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report accelerated SuFEx click chemistry utilizing a synergistic BTMG&#8208;HMDS catalytic system. The power and versatility of the reaction are showcased by the SuFEx synthesis of &gt;100 unique molecules from diverse SuFExable hubs. Accelerated SuFEx is a next generation click reaction that improves upon existing protocols and expands the scope of accessible products.







Abstract
SuFEx click chemistry is a powerful method designed for the selective, rapid, and modular synthesis of functional molecules. Classical SuFEx reactions form stable S&#8722;O linkages upon exchange of S&#8722;F bonds with aryl silyl&#8208;ether substrates, and while near&#8208;perfect in their outcome, are sometimes disadvantaged by relatively high catalyst loadings and prolonged reaction times. We herein report the development of accelerated SuFEx click chemistry (ASCC), an improved SuFEx method for the efficient and catalytic coupling of aryl and alkyl alcohols with a range of SuFExable hubs. We demonstrate Barton's hindered guanidine base (2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine; BTMG) as a superb SuFEx catalyst that, when used in synergy with silicon additive hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), yields stable S&#8722;O bond linkages in a single step; often within minutes. The powerful combination of BTMG and HMDS reagents allows for catalyst loadings as low as 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% and, in congruence with click&#8208;principles, provides a scalable method that is safe, efficient, and practical for modular synthesis. ASSC expands the number of accessible SuFEx products and will find significant application in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science.

         <title>A Modular Approach to the Antifungal Sphingofungin Family: Concise Total Synthesis of Sphingofungin&#8197;A and&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short and flexible total synthesis of antifungal and antiparasitic sphingofungins&#8197;A&#8211;D and congeners was developed by combining a versatile decarboxylative coupling reaction and a cross metathesis protocol.







Abstract
Sphingofungins are fungal natural products known to inhibit the biosynthesis of sphingolipids which play pivotal roles in various cell functions. Here, we report a short and flexible synthetic approach towards the sphingofungin family. Key step of the synthesis was a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of chiral sulfinyl imines with a functionalized tartaric acid derivative, which yielded the core motif of sphingofungins carrying four consecutive stereocenters and a terminal double bond. Subsequent metathesis reaction allowed for the introduction of different side chains of choice resulting in a total of eight sphingofungins, including for the first time sphingofungin&#8197;C (eight steps from commercially available protected tartaric acid with an overall yield of 6&#8201;%) and sphingofungin&#8197;A (ten steps). All newly synthesized derivatives were tested for their antifungal, cell&#8208;proliferative and antiparasitic activity unraveling their structure&#8211;activity relations.

         <title>Be&#8211;Be &#960;&#8208;Bonding and Predicted Superconductivity in MBe2 (M=Zr, Hf)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beryllium in ZrBe2 and HfBe2 forms a honeycomb network of &#960; bonds. Both materials are valence isoelectronic and isostructural to MgB2, and like that compound, are predicted to be superconductors. Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, shows here that it may construct networks of low dimensionality by virtue of its ability to engage in &#960; bonding. Until now, this property was exclusively associated with elements from the p&#8208;block.







Abstract
Beryllium, an s&#8208;block element, forms an aromatic network of delocalized Be&#8211;Be &#960; bonds in alloys ZrBe2 and HfBe2. This gives rise to stacked [Be2]4&#8722; layers with tetravalent cations in between. The [Be2]4&#8722; sublattice is isoelectronic and isostructural to graphite, as well as the [B]&#8722;2 sublattice in MgB2, and it bears identical manifestations of &#960; bonding in its electronic band structure. These come in the form of degeneracies at K and H in the Brillouin zone, separated in energy as the result of interlayer orbital interactions. Zr and Hf use their valence d orbitals to form bonds with the layers, leading to nearly identical band structures. Like MgB2, ZrBe2 and HfBe2 are computed to be phonon&#8208;mediated superconductors at ambient pressures, with respective critical temperatures of 11.4&#8197;K and 8.8&#8197;K. The coupling strength between phonons and free electrons is very similar, so that the difference in critical temperatures is controlled by the mass of constituent interlayer ions.

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N into Colloidal Quantum Dots toward Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a newly&#8208;emerged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered polymer, C  4  N has aroused increasing interest. Yet, the inferior solubility of bulk C  4  N constrains its application scope.&#160;Nanostructing bulk C  4  N into quantum dots (QDs) can enable enhanced or entirely&#8208;new properties, but the C  4  NQDs study remains unavailable. Here, starting from predesigned COF&#8208;like C  4  N, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C  4  NQDs and their functional composites, and explore their optical activities for dual&#8208;mode information encryption and edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalytic ability toward boosted sulfur chemistry in Li&#8208;S cells. Colloidal C  4  NQDs with ultrasmall size of ~2.2 nm bear rich carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating intriguing functionalities by exploiting functional group and edge effects of QDs. While C  4  NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites attain color&#8208;tunable afterglow and FL/room&#8208;temperature &#8208; phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution as a new encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a robust barrier layer to decorate commercial separators and afford superior polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis ability, endowing a Li&#8208;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability and large areal capacity of 5.8 mAh cm  &#8722;2  at high sulfur loading of 7.2 mg cm  &#8208;2  . Computation and experiment studies unveil that edge sites in C  4  N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis relative to in&#8208;plane sites and the synergy of enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs expedites bidirectional catalytic conversion of sulfur species.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Second&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Solid Supramolecules Between Acrylamide&#8208;Phenylpyridium Copolymers and Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8208;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups (P&#8208;R: R=&#8208;CN, &#8208;CO2Et, &#8208;Me, &#8208;CF3) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) are constructed to exhibit tunable second&#8208;level (from 0.9 seconds to 2.2 seconds) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in amorphous state. Compared with other solid supramolecules P&#8208;R/CB[7] (R=&#8208;CN, &#8208;CO2Et, &#8208;Me), P&#8208;CF3/CB[7] displays the longest lifetime (2.2 seconds), which is probably attributed to the fluorophilic interaction of cucurbiturils leading to stronger host&#8208;guest interaction between 4&#8208;penylpyridium with &#8211;CF3 and CB[7]. Furthermore, the RTP solid supramolecular assembly (donors) can further fabricate with organic dyes Eosin Y or SR101 (acceptors) to form ternary supramolecular systems featuring the ultralong phosphorescence energy transfer (PpET) and visible delayed fluorescence (yellow for EY at 568 nm and red for SR101 at 620 nm). Significantly, the ultralong multicolor PpET supramolecular assembly can be further applied in fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption and painting.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8211;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a thermo&#8208;responsive jamming of SPNPs dense suspensions for obtaining macroscopic smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs.







Abstract
Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but were often limited to irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO2&#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to a temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at the solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact properties and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328&#8197;cm&#8201;s&#8722;1. We envision that this finding offers inspiration to design smart liquid&#8211;solid switchable materials for impact protection.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Li&#8722;CO2 Battery Enabled by Carbon Nanotube/Carbon Nitride Heterostructured Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon nanotube/carbon nitride heterostructured photocathode is designed to efficiently utilize photo&#8208;energy to boost sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution kinetics of the Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The resulting Li&#8722;CO2 battery achieves a record&#8208;high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, superior cycling stability with high efficiency retention of 86.1&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh areal capacity of 15.77&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2 reduction/evolution result in low round&#8208;trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, we design a heterostructued photocathode comprising carbon nanotube and carbon nitride to accelerate cathode reactions of a Li&#8722;CO2 battery under illumination. Benefiting from the unique defective structure of carbon nitride and favorable interfacial charge transfer, the photocathode effectively harvests ultraviolet&#8208;visible light to generate abundant photoexcited carriers and coordinates energetic photoelectrons/holes to participate in the discharge/charge reactions, leading to efficient photo&#8208;energy utilization in decreasing reaction barriers and enhancing thermodynamic reversibility of Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The resulting battery delivers a high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8&#8201;% (ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.04&#8197;V) and superior cycling stability (86.1&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles).

         <title>The Chiral Target of Daptomycin Is the 2R,2&#8242;S Stereoisomer of Phosphatidylglycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Daptomycin (dap), an important clinical antibiotic, recognizes the absolute configuration of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a key lipid found in bacterial membranes. The configuration at the headgroup of PG was found to be particularly important for dap&#8211;PG interactions. This is a rare example of a natural product targeting a membrane lipid through chiral recognition.







Abstract
Daptomycin (dap) is an important antibiotic that interacts with the bacterial membrane lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in a calcium&#8208;dependent manner. The enantiomer of dap (ent&#8208;dap) was synthesized and was found to be 85&#8208;fold less active than dap against B. subtilis, indicating that dap interacts with a chiral target as part of its mechanism of action. Using liposomes containing enantiopure PG, we demonstrate that the binding of dap to PG, the structural transition that occurs upon dap binding to PG, and the subsequent oligomerization of dap, depends upon the configuration of PG, and that dap prefers the 1,2&#8208;diacyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;sn&#8208;glycerol stereoisomer (2R,2&#8242;S configuration). Ent&#8208;dap has a lower affinity for 2R,2&#8242;S liposomes than dap and cannot oligomerize to the same extent as dap, which accounts for why ent&#8208;dap is less active than dap. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby the activity of an antibiotic depends upon the configuration of a lipid head group.

         <title>Bulky Cyclometalated Ruthenium Nitrates for Challenging Z&#8208;Selective Metathesis: Efficient One&#8208;Step Access to &#945;&#8208;Oxygenated Z&#8208;Olefins from Acrylates and Allyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent challenge in olefin metathesis is the lack of widely applicable method that converts feedstock allyl alcohols and acylates to valuable &#945;&#8208;oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins. Here, enabled by bulky cyclometalated Ru&#8208;nitrate catalysts whose syntheses were newly unlocked, Z&#8208;selective metathesis between terminal olefins could now be used to access Z&#8208;allyl alcohols, Z&#8208;alkenyl esters, and Z&#8208;alkenyl acids in high yields and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules and serve as versatile handles for organic synthesis, but their syntheses are often tedious and less selective. Here we report the efficient Z&#8208;selective metathesis of various terminal acrylates and allyl alcohols, which enables facile and selective construction of high value&#8208;added &#945;&#8208;oxygenated Z&#8208;olefins from readily available feedstock chemicals. These challenging metathesis transformations are enabled by novel cyclometalated Ru&#8208;carbene&#8208;nitrate complexes bearing bulky&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible side arms, whose assembly was unlocked by new organometallic syntheses.

         <title>Maximizing Step&#8208;Normalized Increases in Molecular Complexity: Formal [4+2+2+2] Photoinduced Cyclization Cascade to Access Polyheterocycles Possessing Privileged Substructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic o&#8208;amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, initiates a complexity building photoinduced cascade of an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] topology, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single photochemical step with up to 220&#8197;mcbit complexity increases.







Abstract
A new complexity building photoinduced cascade which amounts to an unprecedented formal [4+2+2+2] cycloaddition topology is developed to access complex nitrogen polyheterocycles. This photocascade is initiated by the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in aromatic amino ketones with tethered dual unsaturated pendants, i.e. pyrrole and alkenic moieties, resulting in the formation of four &#963;&#8208;bonds and setting six new stereogenic centers in a single experimentally simple photochemical step with up to 220&#8197;mcbit complexity increases.

         <title>Controlling Syneresis of Hydrogels Using Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For self&#8208;shrinkable hydrogels, syneresis can be controlled by tuning the hydrophobic microenvironment within the gel network involving co&#8208;assembly with organic salts.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels can spontaneously undergo syneresis through fibre&#8211;fibre interactions and expel significant amounts of water upon aging. In this process, the hydrophobicity of fibres which regulates the 3D&#8208;rearrangement of the self&#8208;assembled structures during syneresis is important. Here, we show that we can control the hydrophobic microenvironment of gels by incorporating organic salts into the co&#8208;assembled gel fibres thereby enabling control of the macroscopic gel volume phase transition.

         <title>Optimizing Hydrogen Binding on Ru Sites with RuCo Alloy Nanosheets for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing Ru&#8722;H adsorption/desorption efficiency, via adjusting the Ru 
 orbital in RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets, enables highly promoted alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. This optimized adsorption/desorption efficiency is demonstrated by the hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption experiments. The RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets possess a record low overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C.







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, with considerable performance and desirable cost, are becoming highly interesting candidates to replace platinum (Pt) in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hydrogen binding at Ru sites (Ru&#8722;H) is an important factor limiting the HER activity. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that the essence of Ru&#8722;H binding energy is the strong interaction between the 
 orbital of Ru and the 1s orbital of H. The charge transfer between Ru sites and substrates (Co and Ni) causes the appropriate downward shift of the 
&#8208;band center of Ru, which results in a Gibbs free energy of 0.022&#8197;eV for H* in the RuCo system, much lower than the 0.133&#8197;eV in the pure Ru system. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed using RuCo alloy&#8208;nanosheets (RuCo ANSs). They were prepared via a fast co&#8208;precipitation method followed with a mild electrochemical reduction. Structure characterizations reveal that the Ru atoms are embedded into the Co substrate as isolated active sites with a planar symmetric and Z&#8208;direction asymmetric coordination structure, obtaining an optimal 
 modulated electronic structure. Hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption (TPD) tests demonstrate the enhanced Ru&#8722;H interactions in RuCo ANSs compared to those in pure Ru nanoparticles. As a result, the RuCo ANSs reach an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 20.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C. This holistic work provides a new insight to promote alkaline HER by optimizing the metal&#8208;H binding energy of active sites.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical reduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bilayer nanographene 1 (C138H120) with K and Rb in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 affords [K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)2][{K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}2(THF)0.5][C138H1223&#8211;] 2 and [Rb+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2][{Rb+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}2(C138H1223&#8211;)] 3. Whereas K+&#8208;cations are fully solvent&#8208;separated from the trianionic core thus affording a &#8220;naked&#8221; 1&#8226;3&#8211; anion, Rb+&#8208;cations are coordinated to the negatively charged layers of 1&#8226;3&#8211;. According to DFT calculations, the localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to an unprecedented site&#8208;specific hydrogenation process at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the helicene backbone. This uncommon reduction&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific hydrogenation provokes dramatic changes in the (electronic) structure of 1 as the helicene backbone becomes more compressed and twisted upon chemical reduction, which results in a clear slippage of the bilayers.</dc:description>

Thermally sensitive [(Me  4  TACD)  2  Sr  2  (thf)  4  (&#181;-&#954;  3  :&#954;  3  -SiH  6  )][B(C  6  H  3  -3,5-Me  2  )  4  ]  2  (  3a  ) was characterized by  1  H,  29  Si NMR, and vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) as well as single crystal X-ray diffraction. DFT (B3PW91 functional) calculations support the presence of highly polarized bonding between [SiH  6  ]  2&#8722;  and two [(Me  4  TACD)Sr(thf)  2  ]  2+  units. Complex  3a  decomposed in THF at room temperature to the terminal silanide complex [(Me  4  TACD)Sr(SiH  3  )(thf)  2  ][A], with release of H  2  .  3a  releases SiH  4  to react with a weak Br&#248;nsted acid, CO  2  , and 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene as a masked intermediate [(Me  4  TACD)SrH(thf)  x  ]  +  cation to provide the respective strontium dication, formate, and cyclooctatetraenediyl complexes. The reaction of a 1:2 mixture of cationic benzyl complex and neutral dibenzyl with phenylsilane gave the trinuclear silanide complex [(Me  4  TACD)  3  Sr  3  (&#181;  2  -H)  3  (&#181;  3  -SiH  3  )][A]. In contrast,  n  OctSiH  3  led to the trinuclear complex with an (n-alkyl)pentahydridosilicate [(Me  4  TACD)  3  Sr  3  (&#181;  2  -H)  3  (&#181;  3  -SiH  5  n  Oct)][A].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dithia[5]helicenes and their Post&#8208;synthetic Functionalization to Access Dithia[9]helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: A highly enantioselective synthesis of 5,13&#8208;disubstituted dibenzo[d,d&#8217;]benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophenes is reported. Key for the successful assembling of these helical architectures are the last two hydroarylation steps, which consist of successive Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation events. Specifically, the second cyclization is the enantio&#8208;determining step of the whole process and provides the desired helicenes with excellent ee&#8217;s when a TADDOL&#8208;derived 1,2,3&#8208;(triazolium)phosphonite (TADDOL: &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#180;,&#945;&#180;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol) is employed as ancillary ligand.

         <title>Dianion and Dication of Tetracyclopentatetraphenylene as Decoupled Annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;Annulene Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dianion and dication of tetramesityl&#8208;substituted tetracyclopentatetraphenylene, a circulene consisting of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings, have been generated by reduction with alkali metals and oxidation with antimony(V) halides, respectively. They are theoretically predicted to adopt double annulenoid structures called annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;annulene models in which the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled. The theoretical structures were experimentally proven by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses and the electronic configurations were supported by MCD spectra. Based on the  13  C NMR chemical shifts, negative and positive charges are shown to be located mainly at the outer periphery, indicating that the dianion and dication have delocalized 22&#8208;&#960; and 18&#8208;&#960; electron outer perimeters, respectively, and 8&#8208;&#960; electron structure at the inner ring. Notably, the dianion has an open&#8208;shell character whereas the dication has a closed&#8208;shell ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Multiple Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions by Tunable DNA Scaffold Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulation of cell&#8208;cell interactions via cell surface engineering has potential biomedical applications in tissue engineering&#160;and&#160;cell therapy. However, manipulation of the comprehensive and multiple intercellular interactions&#160;remain a challenge and missing elements. Herein, utilizing DNA triangular prism (TP) and branched polymer (BP) as functional modules, we fabricate tunable DNA scaffold networks&#160;on cell surface. The responsiveness of cell&#8208;cell recognition, aggregation and dissociation could be modulated by aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA scaffold networks with high accuracy and specificity. By regulating the DNA scaffold networks coated on cell surface, the controlled intercellular molecular transportation is achieved. Our tunable network provides a simple and extendible strategy which addresses a current need in cell surface engineering to precisely manipulate cell&#8208;cell interactions and shows a promise as a general tool for controllable cell behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Nitric Acid from Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric acid has been widely applied in agriculture and industries. The present manufacturing process via a combination of the Haber&#8208;Bosch process and the Ostwald oxidation process is accompanied by massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. A direct electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitric acid is a promising alternative, especially when it is driven by renewable energy sources. The standardization of performance evaluation is the premise for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for NOR. In this regard, this review first discusses the history of the development of HNO  3  manufacturing and the possible reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic NOR. Then, a strict protocol for electrochemical NOR experiments is recommended. Finally, general research targets associated with techno&#8208;economic analysis, challenges, and prospects for NOR are summarized for future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, possesses non&#8208;invasiveness, high spatial and temporal resolution, and high sensitivity, etc., compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits from the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window imaging, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers devote great efforts to develop contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this review, we summarized recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduced engineering strategies and their imaging performance, classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidated the challenges and prospective of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We hope our summary can inspire further development of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Regulation of Defect Sites and Vertical Conduction by Spiral Domain for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insufficient active sites and weak vertical conduction are the intrinsic factors that restrict the electrocatalytic HER for transition metal dichalcogenides  . As a prototype, we proposed a model of spiral MoTe  2  to optimize collectively above issues. The conductive atomic force microscopy of an individual spiral reveal the retentive vertical conduction irrespective of layer thickness benefiting from the connected screw dislocation lines between interlayers. Theoretical calculation uncover that the regions near the edges step of spiral structures are more easily to form Te vacancies and have lower &#916;G  H  * as extra active sites. A single spiral MoTe  2  &#8208;based on&#8208;chip microcell was fabricated to extract HER activity and achieved ultrahigh current density of 3000 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the overpotential of 0.4 V, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the exfoliated counterpart. Profoundly, this funny spiral model will initiate a new pathway for triggering other inert catalytic reaction</dc:description>

A single spiral MoTe  2  -based on-chip microcell was fabricated to extract HER activity and achieved ultrahigh current density of 3000 mA cm  -2  at the overpotential of 0.4 V, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the exfoliated counterpart. Profoundly, this funny spiral model will initiate a new pathway for triggering other inert catalytic reaction&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Concise and Stereoselective Total Synthesis of the Tricyclic Prostaglandin D2 Metabolite Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise and stereoselective total synthesis of the clinically relevant tricyclic prostaglandin D  2  metabolite (tricyclic&#8208;PGDM) methyl ester in racemic form was accomplished in 8 steps from a readily available known cyclopentene&#8208;diol derivative. The synthesis features a nickel&#8208;catalyzed Ueno&#8208;Stork&#8208;type dicarbofunctionalization to generate two consecutive stereocenters, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative spirolactonization to build the core oxaspirolactone, and a  Z  &#8208;selective cross metathesis to introduce the (  Z  )&#8208;3&#8208;butenoate side chain, a group challenging to introduce through traditional Wittig protocols and troublesome for the two previous total syntheses. A general  Z  &#8208;selective cross metathesis protocol to construct (  Z  )&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters was also developed that has broad functional group tolerance and high stereoselectivity. Additionally, our synthesis already accumulated 75 mg of valuable material for an  18  O tricyclic&#8208;PGDM based assay used in clinical settings for inflammation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Ordered Inverse Opal Structures Synthesized from Shape&#8208;Controlled Nanocrystal Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditions for the co&#8208;assembly of shape&#8208;controlled nanocrystals and templating polystyrene spheres into crack&#8208;free highly ordered macroporous structures preserving the functional and structural properties of the nanocrystals were determined. This opens the doors to numerous opportunities in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and photocatalysis, the latter of which was demonstrated and optimized.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack&#8208;free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc&#8208;doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO2 nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack&#8208;free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications.

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change during the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomechanical crystals composed of 9&#8208;methylanthracene molecules were investigated by Daichi Kitagawa, Christopher J. Bardeen, Seiya Kobatake, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202114089). The crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. Moreover, the quantitative connection between molecular reaction kinetics and mechanical response in well&#8208;defined single crystals provides a new benchmark for analyzing these photomechanical materials.

         <title>Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8722;B Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue/orange dual fluorescence properties of tetramesityldiborane(4) are reported by Yoshiaki Shoji, Yasuhiro Ikabata et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113549). Theoretical calculations showed that the diborane(4) in the S1 state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the blue or orange fluorescence, respectively. The relative intensity of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, highlighting the potential of the diborane(4) as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.

         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion of extracellular vesicles to cell contributes to many critical biological pathways. Inspired by the natural fusion process, Hang Xing et&#8197;al. have developed a liposome fusion&#8208;based transport strategy, termed as LiFT, that enables incorporating a variety of functional moieties onto both external and internal surfaces of cell membrane with precise orientation control (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111647). By using LiFT, asymmetric DNA modifications with orthogonal functionalities on each side of cell membrane is demonstrated, realizing applications such as heterotypic cell assembly and intracellular metabolites detection.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with desirable organic units furnishes advanced materials with unique functionalities. As an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, sp  2  &#8208;carbon&#8211;conjugated COFs provide a facile platform to build highly stable and crystalline porous polymers. . Herein, a 2D olefin&#8208;linked COF was prepared by employing nanographene, namely, dibenzo[  hi  ,  st  ]ovalene (DBOV), as a building block. The DBOV&#8208;COF exhibits unique ABC&#8208;stacked lattices, enhanced stability, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility of ~0.6 cm  2  &#183;V  &#8208;1  &#183;s  &#8208;1  inferred from ultrafast terahertz conductivity measurements. The ABC&#8208;stacking structure was revealed by the high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. DBOV&#8208;COF demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic activity in hydroxylation, which was attributed to the exposure of narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap DBOV cores in the COF pores, in conjunction with efficient charge transport following light absorption.</dc:description>
