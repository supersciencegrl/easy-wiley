         <title>Hydrophobicity Graded Gas Diffusion Layer for Stable Electrochemical Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To mitigate flooding associated with the gas diffusion layer (GDL) during electroreduction of CO2, we report a hydrophobicity&#8208;graded hydrophobic GDL (HGGDL). Coating uniformly dispersed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binders on the carbon fiber skeleton of a hydrophilic GDL uniformizes the hydrophobicity of the GDL and also alleviates the gas blockage of pore channels. Further adherence of the PTFE macroporous layer (PMPL) to one side of the hydrophobic carbon fiber skeleton was aided by sintering. The introduced PMPL shows an appropriate pore size and enhanced hydrophobicity. As a result, the HGGDL offers spatial control of the hydrophobicity and hence water and gas transport over the GDL. Using a nickel&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, the resulting HGGDL electrode provided a CO faradaic efficiency of over 83% at a constant current density of 75 mA cm&#8208;2 for 103 h operation in a membrane electrode assembly, which is more than 16 times that achieved with a commercial GDL.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Transfer Chemiluminescent Spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Probes for Bioanalyte Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminescence imaging of bioanalytes using spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes has gained significant attention due to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and imaging depth compared to excitation&#8208;based probes, as well as their modifiable scaffolds that offer analyte&#8208;specific responses and tunable emissive properties. Among several strategies employed to amplify signals under aqueous conditions and to shift the emission into the bio&#8208;relevant red region, energy transfer to an adjacent fluorophore is a popular and effective method. This minireview highlights spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based probes that operate via an energy transfer mechanism to detect bioanalytes both in vitro and in vivo. Probes that display both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions with fluorophores, as well as their applications in imaging specific analytes will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of cargo phase&#8211;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Here, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8211;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright direction, forming a thick three&#8211;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8211;water surface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly jammed the phase&#8211;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8211;loaded microcomposites (58.3 wt%) persisted the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10 days in type 1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889 times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8211;amphiphilic ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stibenium: Lewis Superacidity by Antimony(III)&#8208;Antimony(V) Electromerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis superacids enable the activation of highly inert substrates. However, the permanent presence of a Lewis superacidic center comes along with a constantly increased intolerance toward functional groups or ambient conditions. Herein, we describe a strategy to unleash Lewis superacidity by electromerism. Experimental and computational results indicate that coordinating a Lewis base to &#916;&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato&#8208;antimony(III) triggers a ligand redox&#8208;noninnocent coupled transfer into a antimony(V)&#8208;state that exhibits Lewis superacidic features. Lewis acidity by electromerism establishes a concept of potential generality for powerful yet robust reagents and on&#8208;site substrate activation approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Promoted by a Ru1Cu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) was achieved over a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires. Single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF to afford DHMF. This work offers a catalyst design model for highly efficient ECH of biomass via single&#8208;atom alloying.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents an elegant route toward sustainable value&#8208;added chemicals production that circumvents the use of fossil fuel and hydrogen. However, the reaction efficiency is hampered by the high voltage and low activity of electrodes (Cu, Bi, Pb). Herein, we report a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires that exhibits an electrochemical reduction of HMF to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with promoted productivity (0.47 vs. 0.08&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and faradic efficiency (FE) (85.6 vs. 71.3&#8201;%) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V (vs. RHE) compared with Cu counterpart. More importantly, the FE (87.5&#8201;%) is largely retained at high HMF concentration (100&#8197;mM). Kinetic studies by using combined electrochemical techniques suggest disparate mechanisms over Ru1Cu and Cu, revealing that single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF via an electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) mechanism.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination of H2 Across a Gallium&#8208;Zinc Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrogen reversibly adds across the Ga&#8722;Zn bond of a heterobimetallic cation. Oxidative addition is favoured in THF solution where the hydrogenation products are stabilized, but in fluorobenzene, reductive elimination of H2 is promoted by the Lewis&#8208;acidic zinc hydride cation.







Abstract
H2 adds reversibly across the metal&#8208;metal bond of [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)(thf)][BAr4F] (BDI=[HC{C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)}2]&#8722;, TMEDA=N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, BAr4F&#8722;=[B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2)4]&#8722;). Due to the stabilising effect of solvent coordination, hydrogenation products [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(thf)][BAr4F] are favoured in THF solution, but THF&#8208;free mixtures of [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(OEt2)][BAr4F] are predisposed towards entropically driven dehydrogenation to [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)][BAr4F] in fluorobenzene solution.

&lt;p&gt;Dihydrogen reversibly adds across the Ga&#8722;Zn bond of a heterobimetallic cation. Oxidative addition is favoured in THF solution where the hydrogenation products are stabilized, but in fluorobenzene, reductive elimination of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is promoted by the Lewis-acidic zinc hydride cation.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Plurizyme with Transaminase and Hydrolase Activity Catalyzes Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PluriZyme with transaminase and esterase activities was constructed by combining computational and laboratory design methods. The enzyme can perform cascade reactions in a single protein scaffold. Experimental evidence is presented for the catalytic efficiency of both the native transaminase and the artificial esterase active site and their synergistic action to transform &#946;&#8208;keto esters into enantiopure &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Engineering dual&#8208;function single polypeptide catalysts with two abiotic or biotic catalytic entities (or combinations of both) supporting cascade reactions is becoming an important area of enzyme engineering and catalysis. Herein we present the development of a PluriZyme, TR2E2, with efficient native transaminase (kcat: 69.49&#177;1.77&#8197;min&#8722;1) and artificial esterase (kcat: 3908&#8211;0.41&#8197;min&#8722;1) activities integrated into a single scaffold, and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR2E2 (pHopt: 8.0&#8211;9.5; Topt: 60&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3&#8208;(R)&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;&#8208;keto ester into the &#946;&#8208;keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently into the &#946;&#8208;amino acid (e.e. &gt;99&#8201;%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR2E2 PluriZyme was proven with a set of &#946;&#8208;keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.

         <title>Multienzyme Redox System with Cofactor Regeneration for Cyclic Deracemization of Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multienzyme cyclic deracemization system with cofactor regeneration was established for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. Chiral sulfoxides were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% yield with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), styrene monooxygenase (SMO), and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).







Abstract
Optically pure sulfoxides are noteworthy compounds applied in a wide range of industrial fields; however, the biocatalytic deracemization of racemic sulfoxides is challenging. Herein, a high&#8208;enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) was combined with a low&#8208;enantioselective styrene monooxygenase (SMO) for the cyclic deracemization of sulfoxides. Enantiopure sulfoxides were obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% yield and with &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee) through dynamic &#8220;selective reduction and non&#8208;selective oxidation&#8221; cycles. The cofactors of MsrA and SMO were subsequently regenerated by the cascade catalysis of three auxiliary enzymes through the consumption of low&#8208;cost D&#8208;glucose. Moreover, this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step&#8221; cyclic deracemization strategy exhibited a wide substrate scope toward various aromatic, heteroaromatic, alkyl and thio&#8208;alkyl sulfoxides. This system proposed an efficient strategy for the green synthesis of chiral sulfoxide.

         <title>Polystyrene&#8208;based Macromolecular Ammonium Halides for Tuning Color and Exchange Kinetics of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium halide&#8208;containing polymers offer a convenient halide source for anion exchange with CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs), tuning their emission color from purple to red while simultaneously allowing formation of stable nanocomposite films. The polymer and its solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation state provide a handle to control inter&#8208;NC anion exchange kinetics, providing a simple solution&#8208;processable route to all&#8208;perovskite white emissive solutions and films.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis anion exchange of all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 NCs, where X=Cl, Br, and/or I) provides a rapid and simple means of tuning their band gap and photoluminescence emission wavelengths. Here we report color&#8208;shifting of CsPbX3 nanocrystals induced by a macromolecular source of halide ions, specifically using polystyrene with ammonium halides as pendent groups. This strategy for introducing new halides to the perovskite nanocrystals gave access to perovskite&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as solutions, thin films, or free&#8208;flowing powders. Spectroscopic measurements of the halide&#8208;exchanged nanocrystal products revealed high photoluminescence quantum yields across the visible spectrum, with exchange kinetics that were tunable based on the solution environment, suggesting an aggregation&#8208;inhibited exchange process that affords access to multi&#8208;colored solutions and films.

         <title>Direct and Selective Electrocarboxylation of Styrene Oxides with CO2 for Accessing &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2 in an undivided cell to yield synthetically important &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids is described. CO2 functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions.







Abstract
Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2 in an undivided cell is reported. This reaction shows broad substrate scopes within styrene oxides under mild conditions, providing practical and scalable access to important synthetic intermediate &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids. Mechanistic studies show that CO2 functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions. Cathodically generated &#945;&#8208;radical and &#945;&#8208;carbanion intermediates lead to the regioselective formation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylation products.

         <title>Capture, Storage, and Release of Oxygen by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging materials for oxygen capture and storage with significant benefits for the broader community. This Minireview assesses and discusses the fundamental chemistry for both selective and reversible MOFs for the role of oxygen capture from air. In addition, we describe the current state of play for oxygen storage by MOFs, as well as engineering solutions to aid in the release of oxygen once captured.







Abstract
Oxygen is a critical gas for medical and industrial settings. Much of today's global oxygen supply is via inefficient technologies such as cryogenic distillation, membranes or zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promise a superior alternative for oxygen separation, as their fundamental chemistry can in principle be tailored for reversible and selective oxygen capture. We evaluate the characteristics for reversible and selective uptake of oxygen by MOFs, focussing on redox&#8208;active sites. Key characteristics for separation can also be seen in MOFs for oxygen storage roles. Engineering solutions to release adsorbed oxygen from the MOFs are discussed including Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and the highly efficient Magnetic Induction Swing Adsorption (MISA). We conclude with the applications and outlooks for oxygen capture, storage and release, and the likely impacts the next generation of MOFs will have on industry and the broader community.

         <title>Discovery of the Biosynthetic Pathway of Beticolin 1 Reveals a Novel Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Dependent Oxygenase for Anthraquinone Ring Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 required for anthraquinone ring cleavage is discovered during elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, in which iron is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water based on its crystal structure. Moreover, Thr299 and His58 mediate Kcx377 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Thus, this work updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.







Abstract
This study used light&#8208;mediated comparative transcriptomics to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of beticolin 1 in Cercospora. It contains an anthraquinone moiety and an unusual halogenated xanthone moiety connected by a bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane. During elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, a novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 responsible for anthraquinone ring cleavage was discovered. More importantly, the discovery of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 is well supported by experimental evidence: (i)&#8197;crystal structure and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that its reactive site is built by an atypical iron ion coordination, where the iron ion is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water; (ii)&#8197;Kcx377 is mediated by His58 and Thr299 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Therefore, we believed this study updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a M&#246;bius Helicene Carbon Nanohoop
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#246;bius helicene nanohoop: A chiral helicene carbon nanohoop with M&#246;bius topology is obtained by integrating stereogenic [6]helicene unit with a planar &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation into radially&#8208;conjugated [7]cycloparaphenylene. The new carbon nanohoop preserves the favorable optoelectronic properties typical for cycloparaphenylenes while [6]helicene endows it with configurational stability and chiroptical properties, such as circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We present the first helicene carbon nanoohop that integrates a [6]helicene into [7]cycloparaphenylene. The [6]helicene endows the helicene carbon nanohoop with chiroptical properties and configurational stability typical for higher helicenes, while the radially conjugated seven para&#8208;phenylenes largely determine the optoelectronic properties. The structure of the helicene carbon nanoohop was unambiguously characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray analysis that revealed that it possesses a topology of a M&#246;bius strip in the solid state and in solution. The chirality transfers from the [6]helicene to the para&#8208;phenylenes and leads to a pronounced circular dichroism and bright circularly polarized luminescence, which is affected by the structural topology of the nanohoop.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative Cyclization Enabled by Asymmetric Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;ligand cooperation permits catalytic enantioselective dearomatization of 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. This work is facilitated by the development of a divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligands. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are realized. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative nature of the catalysis and the observed stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dearomatization is achieved via metal&#8208;chiral ligand cooperation. A new and divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphines is developed to allow rapid access to these ligands, which in turn facilitate the application of this chemistry to a broad substrate scope including 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are achieved via selective acceleration of one enantiomer formation enabled by hydrogen bonding between substrate and ligand remote basic group. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative catalysis and substantiate the reaction stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>Antineoplastic Enzyme as Drug Carrier with Activatable Catalytic Activity for Efficient Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucose oxidase (GOx) as drug carrier delivers anticancer drugs including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. These nanodrugs show acid&#8208;activatable enzyme activity of GOx, thus allowing relatively safe intravenous administration of GOx and effective combination of GOx&#8208;mediated cancer starvation&#8208;like therapy and chemotherapy/photothermal therapy/tumor ferroptosis against 4T1 breast tumors.







Abstract
The delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) requires extra carriers, which suffers from early leakage and exposure of GOx. These issues will be of less concern if GOx itself acts as a drug carrier. However, the catalytic activity of GOx in the blood still needs to be inhibited. Herein, we found that GOx could self&#8208;assemble with hydrophobic molecules into uniform and stable nanoparticles (NPs), including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. The catalytic activity of GOx in NPs was significantly inhibited due to the binding of small molecules with its hydrophobic pockets. After dissociation in the tumor acidic microenvironment, the enzyme activity of GOx could be largely recovered. This acidity&#8208;triggered &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; process ensured safe intravenous administration of GOx&#8208;based NPs. In vivo experiments showed that the combined starvation therapy and ferroptosis/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy effectively inhibited 4T1 breast tumor growth.

         <title>Effect of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed and Intercalated (Oxy)anions on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Oxy)anions can surface&#8208;adsorb on and intercalate into oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. There, they can affect the catalyst's electronic properties and interlayer spacing, stabilizing OER intermediates and potentially breaking the *OH/*OOH scaling relations, as described in this Minireview. Thus, adding (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new OER design dimension.







Abstract
As the kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the decarbonization of our society, a wide range of (pre)catalysts with various non&#8208;active&#8208;site elements (e.g., Mo, S, Se, N, P, C, Si&#8230;) have been investigated. Thermodynamics dictate that these elements oxidize during industrial operation. The formed oxyanions are water soluble and thus predominantly leach in a reconstruction process. Nevertheless, recently, it was unveiled that these thermodynamically stable (oxy)anions can adsorb on the surface or intercalate in the interlayer space of the active catalyst. There, they tune the electronic properties of the active sites and can interact with the reaction intermediates, changing the OER kinetics and potentially breaking the persisting OER *OH/*OOH scaling relations. Thus, the addition of (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new design dimension for OER catalysis and the herein discussed observations deepen the understanding of the role of anions in the OER.

         <title>Gauging Radical Stabilization with Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical stabilization by carbenes is explored computationally. A donor/acceptor frontier orbital picture based on the allyl radical is presented, and allows one to understand and predict radical stabilization in organic radicals, carbene complexes of the transitions metals, as well as of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
Carbenes, including N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, are used extensively to stabilize open&#8208;shell transition metal complexes and organic radicals. Yet, it remains unknown, which carbene stabilizes a radical well and, thus, how to design radical&#8208;stabilizing C&#8208;donor ligands. With the large variety of C&#8208;donor ligands experimentally investigated and their electronic properties established, we report herein their radical&#8208;stabilizing effect. We show that radical stabilization can be understood by a captodative frontier orbital description involving &#960;&#8208;donation to&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation from the carbenes. This picture sheds a new perspective on NHC chemistry, where &#960;&#8208;donor effects usually are assumed to be negligible. Further, it allows for the intuitive prediction of the thermodynamic stability of covalent radicals of main group&#8208; and transition metal carbene complexes, and the quantification of redox non&#8208;innocence.

         <title>Facile Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids into &#945;&#8208;Amino Phosphonates by Decarboxylative Phosphorylation using Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile conversion of &#945;&#8208;amino acids to the respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates via their redox active esters using organophotoredox catalysis is reported. A novel photocatalytic phosphorylation combines radical&#8211;polar crossover with Arbuzov&#8208;type reactivity, providing an operationally simple, high yielding and general synthetic approach for the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates.







Abstract
Amino phosphonates exhibit potent inhibitory activity for a wide range of biological processes due to their specific structural and electronic properties, making them important in a plethora of applications, including as enzyme inhibitors, herbicides, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents. While the traditional synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates has relied on the multicomponent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction, we herein describe a novel and facile conversion of activated derivatives of &#945;&#8208;amino acids directly to their respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonate counterparts via a decarboxylative radical&#8211;polar crossover process enabled by the use of visible&#8208;light organophotocatalysis. The novel method shows broad applicability across a range of natural and synthetic amino acids, operates under mild conditions, and has been demonstrated to successfully achieve the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules.

         <title>Optimize Lithium Deposition at Low Temperature by Weakly Solvating Power Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;  For lithium (Li) metal batteries, the decrease in operating temperature brings severe safety issues by more disordered Li deposition. Here, we demonstrate that the solvating power of solvent is closely related to the reversibility of the Li deposition/stripping process under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The electrolyte with weakly solvating power solvent shows lower desolvation energy, allowing for a uniform Li deposition morphology, as well as a high deposition/stripping efficiency (97.87% at &#8722;40 &#176;C). Based on a weakly solvating electrolyte, we further built a full cell by coupling the Li metal anode with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile electrode at a low anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio for steady cycling at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Our results clarified the relationship between solvating power of solvent and Li deposition behavior at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Megalo&#8208;Cavitands: Synthesis of Acridane[4]arenes and Formation of Large, Deep Cavitands for Selective C70 Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep cavitands, concave molecular containers, represent an important supramolecular host class that has been explored for a variety of applications ranging from sensing, switching, purification and adsorption to catalysis. A major limitation in the field has been the cavitand volume that is restricted by the size of the structural platform utilized (diameter approx. 7 &#197;). We here report the synthesis of a novel, unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14 &#197;), suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814 &#197;  3  . These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with mM to sub&#8208;&#181;M&#160;binding affinity for C  60  and C  70  . Furthermore, the selective binding of fullerene C  70  in the presence of C  60  was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Multiply Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Fused Porphyrins by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of meso&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl Ni(II) porphyrins with internal alkynes proceeded smoothly to give singly, doubly, and quadruply seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring fused Ni(II) porphyrins as the first example of [5+2] annulation reaction for porphyrin substrates, where the meso&#8208;appended pyrrole unit serves as a directing group. These reactions are operationally quite simple and easy. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the isolation of a key intermediate. The structures of the representative products have been revealed to be considerably bent owing to the implemented seven&#8208;membered rings. Doubly fused Zn(II) and Ni(II) porphyrins possessing an unsubstituted meso&#8208;position were dimerized to meso&#8208;meso linked dimers by aerobic oxidation with Zn(OAc)2&#183;2H2O and electrochemical oxidation, respectively. The optical and electrochemical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) &#8208; lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps, as well as the aromatic characters of the fused porphyrins decrease as the fusion parts increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Glutathione Peroxidase Degrader Induces Ferroptosis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>F erroptosis is a new form of&#160; regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic &#160;cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Its&#160; therapeutic potential &#160;is however, greatly limited by the&#160; low&#160; efficiency&#160; of &#160;regulating&#160; cell&#160; ferroptosis in vivo. Herein, we report a PROTAC&#8208;based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)&#160; and&#160; induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX 4 &#160;degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition &#160;using ML162. &#160;Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces cell&#8208;selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the&#160; protein degradation &#160;strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hexachloro Sulfate(iv) Dianion Enabled by Polychloride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation and structural characterization of [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ] is described, which is the first example of a [SCl  6  ]  2&#8211;  dianion and of a halosulfate anion of the type [S  x  X  y  ]  z  &#8211;  in general. This dianion belongs to the group of 14&#8208;valence electron AB  6  E systems and forms an octahedral structure in the solid&#8208;state. Interestingly, co&#8208;crystallization with CH  2  Cl  2  affords [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ]&#8729;4CH  2  Cl  2  containing [SCl  6  ]  2&#8211;  dianions with  C  4v  symmetry. As suggested by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the distortion of the structure is not caused by a stereochemically active lone pair but by enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions with CH  2  Cl  2  . At elevated temperatures, [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ] decomposes to various sulfur chlorine compounds as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Cooling back to room temperature results in the selective formation of [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ] which is comparable to the well&#8208;studied SCl  4  .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have been explored as photocatalysts for CO  2  reductions. Here find that perovskite photocatalytic CO  2  reduction in organic solvents is likely problematic. Instead, the detected products,  i.e.  CO, likely result from a photoredox organic transformation involving the solvent. Our observations have been validated using isotopic labeling experiments, band energy analysis and new control experiments. We designed a typical perovskite photocatalytic setup in organic solvents that led to CO production up to ~1000 &#956;mol/g/h. CO  2  reduction in organic solvents must be studied with extra care, because photoredox organic transformations can produce orders of magnitude higher rate of CO or CH  4  than is typical for CO  2  reduction routes. Though CO  2  reduction is not likely to occur,  in&#8208;situ  CO generation is extremely fast. Hence a suitable system can be established for challenging organic reactions that use CO as a feedstock, but exploit the solvent as a CO surrogate</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The spatial separation between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) in thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecules leads to charge transfer (CT) states, which degrade the oscillator strength of emission transition and sacrifices high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), together limiting its application in organic solid&#8208;state lasers (OSSLs). Here, we demonstrated organic microwire lasers from TADF emitters that combine aggregation induced emission (AIE) and local excited (LE) state characteristics. The unique AIE and LE feature lead to a PLQY approaching 50% and a high optical gain of 870 cm&#8208;1 for TADF microwires. The regenerated singlet excitons by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process are conducive to population inversion. As a result, we demonstrated microwire lasers around 465 nm with a low threshold of 3.74 &#956;J cm&#8208;2. Therefore, our work provides insight to design TADF materials for OSSLs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Economical Chemoselective Metabolomics Using Boronate Ester Formation on a Monolithic Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although chemoselective labeling strategy shows great potential in deep description on metabolomics, the long strategy&#160;time and expensive cost can limit its application in high&#8208;throughput and routine analysis. Herein, we report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multi&#8208;functionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH&#8208;responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5 min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the&#160;discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need of expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum and feces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1,600 times compared with non&#8208;labeling LC&#8208;MS methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Bloom Syndrome Helicase Compresses Single&#8208;Stranded DNA into Phase&#8208;Separated Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is a conserved RecQ family helicase involved in the maintenance of genome stability. BLM has been widely recognized as a genome &#8216;caretaker&#8217; that processes structured DNA. In contrast, our knowledge of how BLM behaves on single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is still limited. Here, we demonstrate that BLM possesses the intrinsic ability for phase separation and can co&#8208;phase separate with ssDNA to form dynamically arrested protein/ssDNA co&#8208;condensates. The introduction of ATP potentiates the capability of BLM to condense on ssDNA, which further promotes the compression of ssDNA against a resistive force of up to 60 piconewtons. Moreover, BLM is also capable of condensing replication protein A (RPA)&#8208; or RAD51&#8208;coated ssDNA, before which it generates naked ssDNA by dismantling these SSB proteins. Overall, our findings identify an unexpected characteristic of a DNA helicase and provide a new angle of protein/ssDNA co&#8208;condensation for understanding the genomic instability caused by BLM overexpression under diseased conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Dihydrofunctionalization: A Dual Catalytic Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Alkynes, Alkenyl Bromides, and Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne.







Abstract
A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne. The synthesis of allylic boronate esters can be accomplished in the presence of a wide range of functional groups, including, esters, nitriles, alkyl halides, sulfonyl esters, acetals, protected terminal alkynes, aryl halides, and silyl ethers. Mechanistic experiments reveal the importance of subtle ligand effects on the performance of the palladium co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Cytochrome P450Blt Enables Versatile Peptide Cyclisation to Generate Histidine&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing Crosslinked Tripeptide Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome&#8197;P450Blt generates A&#8722;N&#8722;B and A&#8722;O&#8722;B crosslinked tripeptides within MRYxH and MRYxW peptides. Removal of the minimal leader peptide allows isolation of these cyclic tripeptides, with sequences further varied by incorporation of a range of residues at the position within the cyclic tripeptide. Biarylitide P450s therefore show potential as biocatalysts for the generation of a diverse range of cyclic tripeptide building blocks.







Abstract
We report our investigation of the utility of peptide crosslinking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes from biarylitide biosynthesis to generate a range of cyclic tripeptides from simple synthons. The crosslinked tripeptides produced by this P450 include both tyrosine&#8208;histidine (A&#8722;N&#8722;B) and tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (A&#8722;O&#8722;B) crosslinked tripeptides, the latter a rare example of a phenolic crosslink to an indole moiety. Tripeptides are easily isolated following proteolytic removal of the leader peptide and can incorporate a wide range of amino acids in the residue inside the crosslinked tripeptide. Given the utility of peptide crosslinks in important natural products and the synthetic challenge that these can represent, P450 enzymes have the potential to play roles as important tools in the generation of high&#8208;value cyclic tripeptides for incorporation in synthesis, which can be yet further diversified using selective chemical techniques through specific handles contained within these tripeptides.

         <title>Sunk&#8208;Cost Bias and Knowing When to Terminate a Research Project</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An awareness of sunk&#8208;cost bias provides an antidote to the scientific optimism that exacerbates the tendency to continue research projects when the likelihood of success is minimal. A survey of academic and industrial practices, as summarized in the sunk&#8208;cost bias decision matrix, captures how implementing controls facilitates data&#8208;driven decisions to terminate or continue research while avoiding emotionally driven decisions that can sap resources.







Abstract
Scientific research is an open&#8208;ended quest where success usually triumphs over failure. The tremendous success of science obscures the tendency for the non&#8208;linear discovery process to take longer and cost more than expected. Perseverance through detours and past setbacks requires a significant commitment that is fueled by scientific optimism; the same optimism required to overcome challenges simultaneously exacerbates the very human tendency to continue a line of inquiry when the likelihood of success is minimal, the so&#8208;called sunk&#8208;cost bias. This Viewpoint Article shows how the psychological phenomenon of sunk&#8208;cost bias influences medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists by comparing how the respective industrial and academic practitioners approach sunk&#8208;cost bias; a series of interviews and illustrative quotes provide a rich trove of data to address this seldom discussed, yet potentially avoidable research cost. The concluding strategies recommended for mitigating against sunk&#8208;cost bias should benefit not only medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists but a wide array of chemistry practitioners.

     alt="Sunk-Cost Bias and Knowing When to Terminate a Research Project"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An awareness of sunk-cost bias provides an antidote to the scientific optimism that exacerbates the tendency to continue research projects when the likelihood of success is minimal. A survey of academic and industrial practices, as summarized in the sunk-cost bias decision matrix, captures how implementing controls facilitates data-driven decisions to terminate or continue research while avoiding emotionally driven decisions that can sap resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific research is an open-ended quest where success usually triumphs over failure. The tremendous success of science obscures the tendency for the non-linear discovery process to take longer and cost more than expected. Perseverance through detours and past setbacks requires a significant commitment that is fueled by scientific optimism; the same optimism required to overcome challenges simultaneously exacerbates the very human tendency to continue a line of inquiry when the likelihood of success is minimal, the so-called sunk-cost bias. This Viewpoint Article shows how the psychological phenomenon of sunk-cost bias influences medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists by comparing how the respective industrial and academic practitioners approach sunk-cost bias; a series of interviews and illustrative quotes provide a rich trove of data to address this seldom discussed, yet potentially avoidable research cost. The concluding strategies recommended for mitigating against sunk-cost bias should benefit not only medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists but a wide array of chemistry practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Specialized Polythioamide&#8208;Binding Protein Confers Antibiotic Self&#8208;Resistance in Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A central contributor to the self&#8208;resistance of an anaerobic antibiotic producer is identified. CtaZ, a new member of the GyrI&#8208;like superfamily, confines the gyrase inhibitor closthioamide in a ligand&#8208;optimized pocket. Genome mining uncovered CtaZ homologs encoded in the genomes of diverse bacteria, including numerous pathogens.







Abstract
Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is central to the development of anti&#8208;infective therapies and genomics&#8208;based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain regarding the resistance strategies employed against novel types of antibiotics from less&#8208;explored producers such as anaerobic bacteria, among them the Clostridia. Through the use of genome editing and functional assays, we found that CtaZ confers self&#8208;resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI&#8208;like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand&#8208;optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing both a new role for a GyrI&#8208;like domain in self&#8208;resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids in uncovering related drug&#8208;resistance mechanisms.

         <title>Umpolung in a Pair of Cobalt(III) Terminal Imido/Imidyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to a CoIII terminal imidyl radical complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a CoIII terminal imido precursor. Oxidation of the CoIII terminal imido to its imidyl redox isomer facilitates intramolecular migratory insertion reactions of the imido with an NHC ligand by a switch of mechanism through umpolung of the imido ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the CoI complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](PF6) (1) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesityl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;methyl]amine) with mesityl azide yields the CoIII imide [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NMes)](PF6) (2). Oxidation of 2 with [FeCp2](PF6) provides access to a rare CoIII imidyl [(TIMMNmes)Co(NMes)](PF6)2 (3). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy confirm the molecular structure of 3 and its S=
 ground state. ENDOR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and computational analyses indicate a ligand&#8208;based oxidation; thus, an imidyl&#8208;radical electronic structure for 3. Migratory insertion of one ancillary NHC to the imido ligand in 2 gives the CoI N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (4) within 12&#8197;h. Conversely, it takes merely 0.5&#8197;h for 3 to transform to the CoII congener (5). The migratory insertion in 2 occurs via a nucleophilic attack of the imido ligand at the NHC to give 4, whereas in 3, a nucleophilic attack of the NHC at the electrophilic imidyl ligand yields 5. The reactivity shunt upon oxidation of 2 to 3 confirms an umpolung of the imido ligand.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Molybdenum&#8208;N3 Sites for Selective Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 to CO is reported over single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety. Density functional theory studies and experimental studies provide additional evidence to support the observed activity. A high and stable conversion of CO2 is attained up to 30.4&#8201;% with a 100&#8201;% CO selectivity.







Abstract
The design of efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is desired yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report that single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety enable remarkable CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation to CO, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by a high and stable conversion of CO2 reaching about 30.4&#8201;% with a CO selectivity of almost 100&#8201;% at 500&#8201;&#176;C and very low H2 partial pressure. Atomically dispersed MoN3 is calculated to facilitate CO2 activation and reduces CO2 to CO* via the direct dissociation path. Furthermore, the highest transition state energy in CO formation is 0.82&#8197;eV, which is substantially lower than that of CH4 formation (2.16&#8197;eV) and accounts for the dominant yield of CO. The enhanced catalytic performances of Mo/NC originate from facile CO desorption with the help of dispersed Mo on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Mo/NC), and in the absence of Mo nanoparticles. The resulting catalyst preserves good stability without degradation of CO2 conversion rate even after 68&#8197;hours of continuous reaction. This finding provides a promising route for the construction of highly active, selective, and robust single&#8208;atom non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

         <title>Mechanochemically Generated Calcium&#8208;Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanochemical technique, we have achieved for the first time the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (Ar&#8722;CaX) from commercially available, unactivated calcium metal without applying any pre&#8208;activation process. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles under mechanochemical conditions.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium&#8208;based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents. This method will allow synthetic chemists to readily access the novel and unique reactivity of organocalcium nucleophiles.

         <title>Reactions of Frustrated Lewis Pairs with Chloro&#8208;Diazirines: Cleavage of N=N Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes are known to lead to rapid loss of N2, reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines prompt N=N double bond cleavage, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R3PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C6F5)2. A detailed DFT mechanistic study shows that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond.







Abstract
The reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes leads to the rapid loss of N2. In contrast, in this work, we reported reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines which led to the reduction of the N=N double bond, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R3PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C6F5)2. A detailed DFT mechanistic study showed that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond, followed by subsequent group transfer reactions to nitrogen and capture of the halide anion.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover and Its Relation to Hydrogenation: Observations on Structurally Defined Single&#8208;Atom Sites
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to common belief, hydrogen spillover can be either beneficial or detrimental to the catalytic performance of hydrogenation catalysts. This was determined through in&#8208;depth studies of structurally well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom catalysts as well as conventional Pt/WO3.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the transfer of H atoms from metal sites onto the catalyst support, is ubiquitous in chemical processes such as catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogen storage. Atomic level information concerning the kinetics of this process, the structural evolution of catalysts during hydrogen spillover, as well as the nature of participation of the spilled over H in catalysis, remain vastly lacking. Here, we provide insights to those questions with a solubilized polyoxometalate&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalyst which allows for the use of characterization techniques generally inaccessible to the study of heterogeneous catalysts. Hydrogenation kinetics together with poisoning studies further reveal that hydrogen spillover can be either detrimental or beneficial for catalysis, the direction and magnitude of which depends mostly on the nature of the reducible functional group. Similar trends were observed on one of the most prototypical hydrogen spillover catalysts&#8212;Pt/WO3.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence from Chiral Perovskite Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral perovskite scintillators emit circularly polarized radioluminescence with a controlled propagation pathway, enabling a new style of X&#8208;ray imaging, which potentially reduces the optical crosstalk.







Abstract
Scintillators display radioluminescent properties when irradiated by high&#8208;energy photons and therefore play an essential role in radiation detection. The current inventory of scintillators is overwhelmingly represented by achiral structures, where the radioluminescence propagates isotropically after generation. Herein, we demonstrate that chiral perovskites of (R&#8208;3AP)PbBr3Cl&#8901;H2O (R&#8208;3APP) and (S&#8208;3AP)PbBr3Cl&#8901;H2O (S&#8208;3APP) emerge as a new type of scintillator displaying a distinct property of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL). A high quantum yield of 27.6&#8201;%, high luminescence dissymmetric factors (glum) of 4&#215;10&#8722;2, and high X&#8208;ray absorption coefficients were observed for these compounds. As proof of concept, we fabricated a polarized scintillator pair by assembling chiral scintillator crystals, which provides a new strategy to attenuate optical crosstalk between the scintillators by precisely controlling the radioluminescence propagation and improves the X&#8208;ray imaging quality at the boundary region.

         <title>Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals Selective Interactions of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) with Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrochemistry using single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;microelectrode collisions supported by spectroscopic and theoretical studies provide insight into the molecular behavior of PFAS at single&#8208;particle scale. The new approach can be used for the ultrasensitive measurement of selected PFASs and accelerate the design of materials and methods that can bind and detect these substances.







Abstract
Nanoelectrochemistry allows for the investigation of the interaction of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the elucidation of the binding behaviour of PFASs to nanoscale surfaces with high sensitivity. Mechanistic studies supported by single particle collision electrochemistry (SPCE), spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the capability of polyfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a representative PFAS, to selectively bind and induce aggregation of AgNPs. Single&#8208;particle measurements provide identification of the &#8220;discrete&#8221; AgNPs agglomeration (e.g. 2&#8211;3 NPs) formed through the inter&#8208;particles F&#8722;F interactions and the selective replacement of the citrate stabilizer by the sulfonate of the PFOS. Such interactions are characteristic only for long chain PFAS (&#8208;SO3&#8722;) providing a means to selectively identify these substances down to ppt levels. Measuring and understanding the interactions of PFAS at nanoscale surfaces are crucial for designing ultrasensitive methods for detection and for modelling and predicting their interaction in the environment.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Chiral Allylboronates by Asymmetric 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly 1,1&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselective alkenylboration of undirected and unactivated alkenes has been developed, which allows chiral allylboronates to be efficiently synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes, alkenyl bromides and B2pin2. This method is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, readily available starting materials, mild and convenient reaction conditions, scalability and practicality.







Abstract
We report herein a modular catalytic method for the efficient enantioselective synthesis of chiral allylboronates from abundant feedstock chemicals through an asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes. This protocol is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, mild and convenient reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, scalability and practicality. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of key intermediates of complex drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that &#946;&#8208;H elimination is a highly regioselective step and the reversible homolysis and convergance to the lower energy pre&#8208;reductive elimination intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Fused Hybrids of a [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complex with a NiII Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly fused porphyrinoids with wavy structures have been synthesized by the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 complexes with NiII porphyrins and a subsequent oxidative fusion reaction with FeCl3. The fused hybrids with cycloheptatriene linkages exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced absorption bands in the near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
[22]Smaragdyrin BF2 complex (S)&#8208;NiII porphyrin (P) fused hybrids were synthesized through Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of brominated S with borylated P and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction with FeCl3 as the first example of directly fused porphyrinoids bearing cycloheptatriene linkage. These fused hybrids have been fully characterized, including their X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Owing to the cycloheptatriene linkage, these fused hybrids adopt waving structures. These fused hybrids display red&#8208;shifted and enhanced Q&#8208;like bands and characteristic redox potentials, depending upon the constitution and the linking position.

         <title>Identification and Structure Analysis of an Unusual Halohydrin Dehalogenase for Highly Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Bio&#8208;Nitration of Epoxides</title>

         <dc:description>
An unusual halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHamb was identified for highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides. Enantiopure &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols containing nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenter were synthezied on preparative scale by whole&#8208;cell biotransformation. The enzyme structure was also solved and analyzed, providing a possible understanding of the chemoselectivity control mechanism in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.







Abstract
We report the discovery of an unusual halohydrin dehalogenase, HHDHamb, that can work under relatively low acidic conditions and extremely low temperatures for the bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides using nitrite as a nitrating agent. The bio&#8208;nitration strategy exhibits high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, catalyzing the kinetic resolution of various epoxides to enantiopure &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenters in up to 41&#8201;% isolated yield and &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). Additionally, the bio&#8208;nitration method displays a high reaction efficiency and can be performed on a gram scale. We also solved the crystal structure of HHDHamb to understand the possible structural determinants of chemoselectivity control in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.

         <title>From Ensemble Electrochemistry to Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry: Altered Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of LaNiO3 nanocube (NC)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) were systematically studied at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels. The selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, offering the scope of new catalytic approaches to be developed.







Abstract
Selective electrochemical production of valued chemicals is of significant importance but remains a great challenge in chemistry. Conventional approaches for enhancing reaction selectivity focus on the improvement of the catalysts themselves. In this work, we systematically studied the reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of LaNiO3 nanocubes (LaNiO3 NCs) catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry (NIE). We find that the selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, due to the significantly enhanced mass transport at single nanoparticles. This discovery offers the scope of new catalytic approaches for engineering electrochemical reactions in general.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Bonding Oxidation Group and Titanium Cluster to Synthesize a Porous Crystalline Catalyst for Selective Photo&#8208;Oxidation Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium&#8208;cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been prepared through the covalent&#8208;coupling between the Ti&#8208;cluster and an oxidation group. The resulting nanosheets can be applied for highly selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass HMF into FDCA.







Abstract
The selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is important due to its substitute&#8208;role in polyester&#8208;fabrication. Here, a titanium&#8208;cluster based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling between Ti6&#8208;NH2 and benzotrithiophene tricarbaldehyde (BTT). The integration of them endows the nanosheet with a visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and suitable photo&#8208;oxidation ability. Specifically, its photo&#8208;selectivity for HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA can be &gt;95&#8201;% with &#8776;100&#8201;% conversion, which is more than 2, 5, and 10 times higher than MOF&#8208;901 (43&#8201;%), Ti6&#8208;NH2 (19&#8201;%) and under&#8208;darkness (9&#8201;%), respectively. Notably, an O2&#8208;based mechanism is proposed and the vital roles of Ti6&#8208;NH2 and BTT are verified by DFT calculations. This work might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline&#8208;catalysts for selective biomass&#8208;valorization.

         <title>Piezochromic Tetracoordinate Boron Complex: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetracoordinate boron complex shows polymorphism&#8208;dependent luminescence. Impressively, Y&#8208;phase crystals showed rare piezochromic luminescent properties: pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission. This phenomenon is due to a cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and changes in the charge&#8208;transfer behavior during compression.







Abstract
Achieving blueshifted and enhanced emission from purely organic luminophors remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a tetracoordinate boron complex with polymorphism (Y&#8208;phase and O&#8208;phase)&#8208;dependent luminescence. Impressively, the Y&#8208;phase crystals exhibited rare piezochromic luminescent properties such as pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission. The results of theoretical and experimental tests demonstrated that this phenomenon results from the cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and alterable charge transfer (CT) behavior during compression. This work provides an ideal model to investigate the optoelectronic properties of boron complexes. Importantly, manipulating the CT behavior through the electrophilicity of boron atoms may become a new principle for the design of piezochromic materials with blueshifted and enhanced emission.

         <title>Encoding Supramolecular Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly with Photo&#8208;Controlled Circularly Polarized Luminescence by Overcrowded Alkene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;PBI Modulators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing photoresponsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials is an essential step for biosensing and biomedical applications. However, fabricating CPL assemblies rooted in the chirality amplification and transmission of the molecular building blocks, which simultaneously show photo&#8208;controllable CPL signals, remains challenging. Herein, a molecular building block containing an overcrowded&#8208;alkene core and bis&#8208;  PBI  (  MPBI  ) was designed. Importantly, the enantiopure  MPBI  can self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;organized nanofibers via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and enable the transmission of the intrinsic chirality, providing opposite CPL signals. The photoisomerization of  MPBI  induced a transformation from nanofibers to discrete nanospheres, accompanied by a gradually decreased CPL signal. The results demonstrated the development of photo&#8208;controllable CPL materials from the assembly of chiral  MPBI  , which provides an alternatively facile strategy to fabricate CPL&#8208;active materials and would offer opportunities for future biosensing and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Interaction of K and O2 on Au(111): Multiple Growth Modes of Potassium Oxide and Their Catalytic Activity for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In industrial catalysis, alkali cations are frequently used to promote activity or selectivity. Scanning tunneling microscopy, ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelecron spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional calculations were used to study the structure and reactivity of potassium oxides in contact with the Au(111) surface. Three different types of oxides (K  2  O  2  , K  2  O and KO  y  with y &lt; 0.5) were observed on top of the gold substrate at 300&#8208;525 K. Initially, small aggregates of K  2  O  2  /K  2  O (1&#8208;2nm in size) were seen at the elbows of the herringbone structure. After increasing the K coverage (&gt; 0.15 ML), large islands of the oxide (20&#8208;40 nm in size) appeared. These islands contained a mixture of K  2  O and KO  y  (y &lt; 0.5). A key correlation was found involving the structure, oxidation state, and chemical activity of the alkali oxide. The small aggregates of potassium oxide had a very high catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO, being much more than plain promoters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Recyclable Crosslinked Polymer Network Enabled by Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of synthetic polymers offers a solution for developing sustainable plastics and materials. Here we show that two types of dynamic covalent chemistry can be orthogonalized in a solvent&#8208;free polymer network and thus enable a chemically recyclable crosslinked material. Using a simple acylhydrazine&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;dithiolane as the starting material, the disulfide&#8208;mediated reversible polymerization and acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent crosslinking can be combined in a one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;free reaction, resulting in mechanically robust, tough, and processable crosslinked materials. The dynamic covalent bonds in both backbones and crosslinkers endow the network with depolymerization capability under mild conditions and, importantly, virgin&#8208;quality monomers can be recovered and separated. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study show opportunities to design chemically recyclable materials based on the dynamic chemistry toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double&#8208;Helix Metal&#8208;Chain Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a High&#8208;Output Triboelectric Nanogenerator Material for Self&#8208;Powered Anticorrosion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel metal organic framework (MOF) friction power generation materials with high stability is important. This paper reports the first example of a double helical metal chain organic framework with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8). ZUT&#8208;8 shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability, and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The cathodic protection system with ZUT&#8208;8 can prevent metal corrosion significantly. The output performance can be improved effectively by enhancing the conjugate effect of the linker. The theoretical calculation results showed that an increase in the degree of conjugation could significantly reduce the bandgap, thereby affecting the friction power output signal. This study opens the door to constructing MOF materials with a double&#8208;helix metal chain and will promote their potential applications in self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization of Alkyl Benzene Derivatives via Cooperative Catalysis of Gold/Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkyl benzene derivatives was successfully developed via cooperative catalysis of gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), leading to synthetically useful chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs. Chiral phosphoric acid, ligand, and molecular sieves were found crucial for enantioselectivity control of this transformation. The salient features of this protocol include mild conditions, high efficiency, commercially available starting materials, highly chemo&#8208; and site&#8208; as well as enantioselective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization, broad substrate scope, and extensive applications of the chiral products. The mechanistic studies suggested that two CPAs might be involved in chiral induction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>PEGylation is one of the most promising approaches to address the central challenge of applying biologics: i.e. the lack of protein stability in the demanding environment of the human body.&#160; Wider application of PEGylation is hindered by the lack of atomic level understanding of protein&#8208;PEG interactions, preventing design of conjugates with predicted properties.&#160; We deployed an integrative structural and biophysical approach to address this critical challenge with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3C), a lectin essential for cellular adhesion and potential biologic.&#160;&#160; PEGylation dramatically increased Gal3C thermal stability and redirected its unfolding pathway through forming a stable intermediate.&#160; Structural details of Gal3C&#8208;PEG revealed by NMR pointed to the important role of PEG localization, and we identified charged amino acids bordering the Gal3C&#8208;PEG interface that were especially important in controlling localization. &#160;Replacing these residues altered the protein&#8208;PEG interface and thermal unfolding behavior, providing a strategy for rationally designing conjugates while maintaining the benefits of PEGylation.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Membrane&#8208;Protein Binding Kinetics and Cell&#8211;Surface Adhesion Using Plasmonic Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is an excellent platform for in situ studying cell&#8208;substrate interactions. However, SPRM suffers from poor spatial resolution and small field of view. Herein, we demonstrate plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) by adding a dry objective on a popular prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM not only retains SPRM&#8217;s high sensitivity and real&#8208;time analysis capability, but also provides ~7 times higher spatial resolution and ~70 times larger field of view than the typical SPRM, thus providing more details about membrane protein response to ligand binding on over 100 cells simultaneously. In addition, PSM allows quantifying the target movements in the axial direction with a high spatial resolution, thus allowing mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts. This work may offer a powerful and cost&#8208;effective strategy for upgrading current SPR products.</dc:description>

PSM not only retains SPRM&#8217;s high sensitivity and real-time analysis capability, but also provides ~7 times higher spatial resolution and ~70 times larger field of view than the typical SPRM, thus providing more details about membrane protein response to ligand binding on over 100 cells simultaneously. In addition, PSM allows quantifying the target movements in the axial direction with a high spatial resolution, thus allowing mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing the mechanical properties of the cell-substrate contacts. This work may offer a powerful and cost-effective strategy for upgrading current SPR products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Confinement of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Hydrates by a Capped Metallo&#8208;Cage under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of a hydrated rare&#8208;earth metal ion in a hydrophobic cavity was demonstrated under aqueous conditions by a cooperative system of a synthetic coordination cage and a tripodal capping anion. By the cooperation of the cage cavity and the caps, selective recognition and separation of early lanthanoid ions were achieved.







Abstract
The properties of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in aqueous media often depend on their various hydration modes, which allow them to exist as monomeric or oligomeric species with different coordination numbers. Capturing rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in a confined cavity can fix their hydration modes and thus enable their intrinsic properties to be distinguished. However, the isolation of ionic species from bulk aqueous media is not an easy task due to competitive interaction with bulk water. Here, we report the encapsulation of hydrated rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in a hydrophobic cavity of a synthetic cage. Cap&#8208;like counter anions located at the cage's portals play an important role in capturing the rare&#8208;earth metals at a fixed position via electrostatic interactions. Preferential encapsulation of early lanthanoid (III) ions was observed even though all the rare&#8208;earth metals have the same hydration number and geometry, as visualized by the competitive inclusion of a dye molecule. Accordingly, the early lanthanoid ion was selectively extracted from a mixture of two rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions.

         <title>A Modular Co&#8208;assembly Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Perovskite Oxides with Abundant Surface Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular co&#8208;assembly method is developed to synthesize a series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxide/C composites and mesoporous perovskite oxides. Notably, the rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure of mesoporous La2Zr2O7 endow 94&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan.







Abstract
The ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with well&#8208;defined mesostrcture and versatile metal sites are attractive, but their successful synthesis faces challenges of complicated assembly dynamics and pore collapse in crystalline calcination. Here, we propose an energy balance concept to reveal interplay relationship in assembly process and realize regulation of porous structure for mesoporous perovskite oxides. A series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with unique porous structure were prepared by a modular co&#8208;assembly method. Mesoporous La2Zr2O7 shows 94&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Experiments reveal that rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure promote interaction between mesoporous La2Zr2O7 and HMF and reduce catalytic energy barrier. This work provides the insight into molecule co&#8208;assembly and developing multiple component ordered mesoporous materials.

         <title>A Dihydroazulene&#8208;Based Photofluorochromic AIE System for Rewritable 4D Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dihydroazulene&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission system is developed and systematically investigated. The light&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and heat&#8208;driven closing processes endow it with controllable and quantitively described photofluorochromic properties. Accordingly, a rewritable 4D information encryption system with dynamic patterns is demonstrated, which shows a considerable data&#8208;storage capacity and multiple characteristics.







Abstract
Dynamic patterns based on luminescent materials play an essential role in the digital age. However, it is still challenging to develop highly emissive photofluorochromic materials with dynamic behaviors to store information with multiple characteristics. Here, we report a series of dihydroazulene&#8208;based compounds which show typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. Moreover, the photo&#8208;switching ability of the dihydroazulene units, undergoing light&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening, enables photofluorochromic properties. The photofluorochromism also shows quantitively described responses to time and temperature via a reverse ring&#8208;closing process. Ultimately, a rewritable 4D information system, embedded with a quick response code, dot matrix with microstructures, color matrix of fluorescence, and time/temperature&#8208;dependent intensity change, is established with dynamic patterns. This work not only develops a dynamic AIE skeleton with photofluorochromic properties but also provides a new strategy for information encryption and cybernetics.

         <title>Organic Sulfonium&#8208;Stabilized High&#8208;Efficiency Cesium or Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic sulfonium bromide was introduced as a new X&#8208;type ligand to synthesize cesium or methylammonium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). The purified PNCs exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) without post&#8208;treatments and showed high ambient stability. The CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene, and the composite exhibited a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new X&#8208;type ligand, i.e., organic sulfonium bromide, for high&#8208;efficiency CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). We first confirmed the facile synthesis of the titled ligands in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at room temperature. By reacting dodecylmethylsulfide with allyl bromide, (3&#8208;bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane, and 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane, respectively, three representative ligands (named DAM, DSM, and DMM) are acquired. All of them result in CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 PNCs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and decent ambient stability (no less than 90&#8201;% PLQY after 2&#8197;months) using a room&#8208;temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation technique. Among them, DSM and DMM endow CsPbBr3 PNCs with higher thermal/light stability arising from the cross&#8208;linkable or bidentate ligand structure. Further, DSM&#8208;CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene through in situ thermal polymerization and the composite shows a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Discrete Macrocycles with Fixed Chirality and Two Distinct Sides: Dipole&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle has enabled the synthesis of a series of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with various dipolar structures. Analysis of their enantiomers by chiroptical spectroscopy revealed that dipolar electronic distribution led to weak dissymmetry in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses, thus demonstrating the importance of reducing the nonsymmetry of macrocycles.







Abstract
Control of symmetry is fundamental in molecular design with aimed properties. Herein we report a set of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with variable dipolar structures based on a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle, pillar[5]arene. Incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing ester groups formed an explicit two&#8208;sided structure, leading to increase in response wavelength and luminescence efficiency. On the other hand, chiroptical measurement of separated enantiomers revealed that such a dipolar character diminished dissymmetry of the electronic transitions. By suppressing the dipole, the dissymmetry factor for luminescence was enhanced from 0.4&#215;10&#8722;3 to 5.1&#215;10&#8722;3 in a less dipolar methoxy&#8208;substituted molecule, which was larger than reported pillar[5]arene derivatives without C5&#8208;symmetry around one order of magnitude.

     alt="Discrete Macrocycles with Fixed Chirality and Two Distinct Sides: Dipole-Dependent Chiroptical Response"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of a rim-differentiated cylindrical macrocycle has enabled the synthesis of a series of chiroptical &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric molecules with various dipolar structures. Analysis of their enantiomers by chiroptical spectroscopy revealed that dipolar electronic distribution led to weak dissymmetry in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses, thus demonstrating the importance of reducing the nonsymmetry of macrocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control of symmetry is fundamental in molecular design with aimed properties. Herein we report a set of chiroptical &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric molecules with variable dipolar structures based on a rim-differentiated cylindrical macrocycle, pillar[5]arene. Incorporation of electron-withdrawing ester groups formed an explicit two-sided structure, leading to increase in response wavelength and luminescence efficiency. On the other hand, chiroptical measurement of separated enantiomers revealed that such a dipolar character diminished dissymmetry of the electronic transitions. By suppressing the dipole, the dissymmetry factor for luminescence was enhanced from 0.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 5.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; in a less dipolar methoxy-substituted molecule, which was larger than reported pillar[5]arene derivatives without &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetry around one order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Cooperatively Grown J&#8208;aggregates with Different Nucleus Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular aggregation system is studied in which the two J&#8208;aggregates are both assembled cooperatively. A series of variable&#8208;temperature experiments indicate that the different nucleus sizes of J1 and J2 account for the difference in their elongation temperatures. Despite the thermodynamic stability of J2 at around room temperature, the smaller nucleus size and higher elongation temperature facilitate the J1 formation from thermal treatment.







Abstract
A molecule featuring two distinct cooperatively grown J&#8208;aggregates is investigated. Interestingly, when cooling a hot monomer solution, the thermodynamically less stable J1 is exclusively formed even at a particularly slowed temperature dropping rate, which transforms to the more stable J2 at room temperature with very slow kinetics. This observation is ascribed to the differed nucleus sizes of J1 and J2. During the cooling process, smaller J1 nuclei are formed first at a higher temperature, favored by the entropy effect. At intermediate temperatures, the elongation of J1 out&#8208;competes the nucleation of J2. Then, below the elongation temperature of J2, the formation of this thermodynamically stable aggregate is hindered kinetically, due to the depletion of monomer by the slow dissociation of J1. Additional evidence proving the larger nucleus size of J2 is also identified with the varied&#8208;temperature spectral analyses and mathematic simulations.

         <title>Deep Learning for Additive Screening in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive engineering has significantly improved the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices, and is promising for further enhancing perovskite devices&#8217; efficiency. A key challenge is to choose suitable additive for perovskite. The approach based on deep learning helps to predict the suitable additives, giving rising to high&#8208;performance near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Additive engineering with organic molecules is of critical importance for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronic devices. However, experimentally finding suitable additives is costly and time consuming, while conventional machine learning (ML) is difficult to predict accurately due to the limited experimental data available in this relatively new field. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning method that can predict the effectiveness of additives in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with a high accuracy up to 96&#8201;% by using a small dataset of 132 molecules. This model can maximize the information of the molecules and significantly mitigate the duplicated problem that usually happened with previous models in ML for molecular screening. Very high efficiency PeLEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency up to 22.7&#8201;% can be achieved by using the predicated additive. Our work opens a new avenue for further boosting the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Field NMR, Reactivity, and DFT Modeling Reveal the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Surface Hydroxyl Network
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl network of gamma&#8208;Al2O3 was studied over a 300&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C dehydroxylation temperature range. High&#8208;field MAS NMR, IR and DFT were harnessed to provide an unprecedented qualitative and quantitative assessment of the AlOH network, with impact on understanding of alkane conversion catalysts.







Abstract
Aluminas are strategic materials used in many major industrial processes, either as catalyst supports or as catalysts in their own right. The transition alumina &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 is a privileged support, whose reactivity can be tuned by thermal activation. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 at three different dehydroxylation temperatures. The principal [AlOH] configurations are identified and described in unprecedented detail at the molecular level. The structures were established by combining information from high&#8208;field 1H and 27Al solid&#8208;state NMR, IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, as well as selective reactivity studies. Finally, the relationship between the hydroxyl structures and the molecular&#8208;level structures of the active sites in catalytic alkane metathesis is discussed.

         <title>Scalable, Chemoselective Nickel Electrocatalytic Sulfinylation of Aryl Halides with SO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by electrochemistry, the conversion of aryl halides to sulfinates using an inexpensive Ni catalyst at room temperature is reported. The use of SO2 stock solution at controlled concentration represents a convenient sulfur source. The sulfinate intermediates can be derivatized into sulfonyl fluorides, sulfonamide, and sulfone in a one&#8208;pot fashion. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up in batch and flow.







Abstract
Simple access to aryl sulfinates from aryl iodides and bromides is reported using an inexpensive Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic protocol. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, uses stock solution of simple SO2 as sulfur source, and can be scaled up in batch and recycle flow settings. The limitations of this reaction are clearly shown and put into context by benchmarking with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based methods.

         <title>Topochemical Cycloaddition Reaction between an Azide and an Internal Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes are generally unreactive in solution&#8208;phase 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. However, a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction involving an internal alkyne has now been achieved by using a cyclitol&#8208;derived monomer containing an azide and an internal alkyne group. Heating the crystals results in the monomer undergoing a topochemical polymerization to yield trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked&#8208;polycyclitol.







Abstract
Here we report the synthesis of a trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymer using a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction.

     alt="Topochemical Cycloaddition Reaction between an Azide and an Internal Alkyne"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal alkynes are generally unreactive in solution-phase 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. However, a topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction involving an internal alkyne has now been achieved by using a cyclitol-derived monomer containing an azide and an internal alkyne group. Heating the crystals results in the monomer undergoing a topochemical polymerization to yield trisubstituted-1,2,3-triazole-linked-polycyclitol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report the synthesis of a trisubstituted-1,2,3-triazole-linked polymer using a topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. A cyclitol-derived monomer having an azide and an internal alkyne group was designed. The four hydroxy groups present in this monomer dictate its crystal packing such that the monomer molecules are arranged head-to-tail, thereby placing the internal alkyne and the azide units of adjacent molecules proximally. Although the alignment of the reactive groups in the monomer crystal is not favourable for a topochemical reaction, a reactive orientation can be achieved by the rotation of the reactive groups. Upon heating the crystals, the monomer underwent topochemical polymerization to yield the trisubstituted-1,2,3-triazole-linked-polycyclitol. This study demonstrates a new synthetic strategy for cycloaddition reaction between non-polarized internal alkynes and azides to yield trisubstituted triazoles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Bonding Nature in the Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Core&#8208;Shell Syngenetic &#963;&#8208;Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the chemical bond in a stable crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster. It involves a 3c&#8211;2e Th3 core bond and a multicenter (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. The resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies from the BLW method further confirm that this novel 3c&#8211;2e Th3 core bond is delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.







Abstract
A unique thorium&#8208;thorium bond was observed in the crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster [{Th(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2}3{K(THF)2}2]&#8734;, though the claim of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity for Th3 bond has been questioned. Herein, a new type of core&#8211;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the stability of this tri&#8208;thorium cluster. The model involves a 3c&#8211;2e bond in the Th3 core and a multicentered (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. To differentiate the strengths of the 3c&#8211;2e bond and the charge&#8208;shift bond, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method which falls into the ab initio valence bond (VB) theory is employed to construct a strictly core/shell localized state and its contributing covalent resonance structure for the Th3 core bond. By comparing with the &#963;&#8208;aromatic H3+ and nonaromatic Li3+, the computed resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies confirm that this Th3 core bond is truly delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Coordination Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Capacity Ammonium Storage in Amorphous Manganese Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous manganese phosphate material is prepared using an electrochemical method for aqueous NH4+ ion storage. The electrode displays an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 299.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in NH4Ac electrolyte. Acetate ions can coordinate with the Mn sites and tailor the surface properties of the electrode, leading to the enhanced NH4+ adsorption capability.







Abstract
Ammonium (NH4+) ion as charge carrier is attracting attention in aqueous batteries. Yet, most NH4+ host materials are still limited by the relatively low capacities. Here, we fabricated a manganese phosphate (MP&#8208;20) for NH4+ ion storage. MP&#8208;20 displays a high capacity of 299.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte, outperforming other reported NH4+ host materials. Spectroscopy studies suggest a new NH4+/H+ co&#8208;insertion mechanism. We surprisingly discover that the NH4Ac electrolyte plays an important role in improving the charge storage capability of the materials. Experimental and computational results indicate acetate ions can form coordination bonds with the Mn atoms, tailoring the electronic structure of the Mn atoms and the surrounding O atoms, and therefore facilitating the NH4+ storage process. Our findings provide a new NH4+ host material and propose the important role of the electrolyte&#8208;electrode coordination effect in aqueous ammonium batteries.

         <title>Efficient Gene Silencing in Intact Plant Cells Using siRNA Delivered By Functional Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to intact plants for gene silencing mainly relies on viral vectors and  Agrobacterium&#8208;  mediated transformation due to the barrier of intact plant cell wall. Here, we reported that polymer functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONs) enable siRNA transfer into intact plant cells and bring about efficient gene silencing. We found that sheeted GONs could efficiently load siRNA to form small sized, near&#8208;spheroidal GONs&#8208;siRNA complex, which could be across the cell wall and internalize in the plant cell. The GONs&#8208;siRNA exhibited transient and strong silencing (97.2% efficiency) in plant tissues at 24 h after treatment and returned to normal level at 5 days after treatment. This method has the obvious advantages of efficient, transient, simple, stability and well biocompatibility, which should greatly stimulate the application of nanomaterials as gene&#8208;engineering tools in plant research.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New technology is reported that enables Negishi couplings to be run under sustainable, far greener conditions. Thus, ppm Pd&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed that catalyze couplings in recyclable water under very mild conditions. These heterogeneous reactions involve loadings of Pd of typically only 2500 ppm (0.25 mol %). Highly functionalized aromatic and heteroaromatic bromides readily participate, including examples taken from the Merck Informer Library indicative of the functional group tolerance associated with these couplings. Direct comparisons with existing literature routes are made. Very low residual levels of Pd in newly formed products are to be expected, as determined by ICP&#8208;MS. The reagent involved has been extensively characterized via DLS, TEM, cryo&#8208;TEM, and EDX measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Nanoparticles on Lipophilic Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis. Reported examples employ hydrophilic graphene oxides as substrates, making it difficult to coexist with organic substrates in organic solvents. The title NGs are metal NP&#8208;doped&#160;lipophilic NGs&#160;(M&#8208;NG1). Various metal cations form NPs with a diameter of a few to tens of nanometers on the basal plane.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis. Reported examples employ hydrophilic graphene oxides as substrates, making it difficult to coexist with organic substrates in organic solvents. The title NGs are metal NP-doped&#160;lipophilic NGs&#160;(M-NG1). Various metal cations form NPs with a diameter of a few to tens of nanometers on the basal plane.

         <title>Enhanced Aromaticity and Open&#8208;shell Diradical Character in The Dianions of 9&#8208;Fluorenylidene Substituted Expanded Radialenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radialenes and expanded radialenes are cross&#8208;conjugated macrocycles displaying poor aromatic character. In this work, three 9&#8208;fluorenylidene substituted expanded [n]radialenes (  ER&#8208;n  ,  n  =3&#8208;5) with diacetylene spacer were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and NMR spectroscopy. They all can be easily reduced into relatively stable dianions. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that their dianions (  ER&#8208;n  2&#8208;  ,  n  =3&#8208;5) are stabilized by both the aromatic fluorenyl anion substituents and the central aromatic rings with formally [4  n  +2] delocalized &#960; electrons. In addition, the dianions of the extended radialenes (  ER&#8208;4  2&#8208;  and  ER&#8208;5  2&#8208;  ) show unique open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. For comparison, their linear counterparts (  L&#8208;3  and  L&#8208;4  ) were also synthesized and their dianions exhibit very different redox and optical properties from their respective macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Strained Bi&#8208;MOF on Bismuth Oxyhalide Support with Tailored Intermediate Adsorption/Desorption Capability for Robust CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, using as&#8208;designed surface&#8208;mounted Bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) on two&#8208;dimensional BiOBr support, as an operable platform for site&#8208;specific strain engineering to tailor the intermediate adsorption/desorption capability in CO  2  photocatalytic conversion is proposed. Giant compressive strain up to 7.85% is successfully induced on the surface&#8208;mounted Bi&#8208;MOF revealed by HRTEM images and geometric phase analysis as well as in situ Raman characterization, which largely downshifts the p band center of Bi nodes and intensifies their unsaturated state. In&#8208;depth explorations are put onto p&#8208;p (Bi 6p and CO  2  /CO 2p) orbital hybridization. Taking the adsorption process as an example, the 1&#960; and 7&#963; frontier molecule orbitals of CO  2  2p for both the strain&#8208;free and strained models shifts downwards the Fermi level, indicative of fast adsorption of CO  2  . Meanwhile, strain engineering further induces new non&#8208;degenerate orbital overlapping near 1&#960; and intensified overlapping of 7&#963; orbitals, stimulating the fast activation of absorbed CO  2  molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Nanozymes for Enantioselective Biological Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a neat combination of the characteristics of enzymatic activity and nanomaterials, nanonzymes have attracted much attention. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, substrate selectivity is often overlooked in the construction of nanozymes. With the subtly evolutional structures, natural enzymes generally possess high selectivity for chiral substrates, which play important roles in biosynthesis and biomedical applications. However, rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. In this Minireview, we overview recent advances in synthesis strategies of chiral nanozymes and their enantioselective biological catalysis. We further focus on current challenges, potential solutions and future developing trends of chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis. There is plenty of room to explore. This review will provide new insights into the development of chiral nanozymes and their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters in Non&#8208;Doped Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2&#160;and CO to Methanol: The Renaissance of Low Temperature Catalysis in the Context of the Methanol Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional economy based on carbon intensive fuels and materials has led to an exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2&#160;emissions. Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2&#160;levels increased by 50% since the pre&#8208;industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed&#160;methanol economypioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO2&#160;to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction,&#160;homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO2, CO and their derivatives as potential low temperature alternatives to the commercial processes.&#160;This review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Transfer Pathways in Nitrogenase with and without Dissociated S2B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can convert N  2  &#160;to NH  3  . Crystallographic structures have indicated that one of sulfide ligands of the active&#8208;site FeMo cluster, S2B, can be replaced by an inhibitor, like CO and OH  &#8211;  , and it has been suggested that it may be displaced also during the normal reaction. We have investigated possible proton transfer pathways within the FeMo cluster during the conversion of N  2  H  2  &#160;to two molecules of NH  3  , assuming that the protons enter the cluster at the S3B, S4B or S5A sulfide ions and are then transferred to the substrate. We use combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations with the TPSS and B3LYP functionals. The calculations indicate that the barriers for these reactions are reasonable if the S2B ligand remains bound to the cluster, but they become prohibitively high if S2B has dissociated. This suggests that it is unlikely that S2B reversibly dissociates during the normal reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Hexagonal Planar Nickel: A Dispersion&#8208;Stabilised Tri&#8208;Lithium Nickelate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the understanding of lithum nickelate complexes, here we report a family of homoleptic organonickelate complexes obtained by reacting Ni(COD)2and lithium aryl&#8208;acetylides in the presence of the bidentate donor TMEDA. These compounds represent rare examples of low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metals supported solely by organolithium ligands. Whilst the solid&#8208;state structures indicate a hexagonal planar geometry around Ni(0) with Ni&#8211;Li bonds, bonding analysis via QTAIM, NCI, NBO and ELI methods reveals that the Ni&#8211;Li interactions are repulsive in nature, characterising these complexes as tri&#8208;coordinated. London dispersion forces between TMEDA and the organic substituents on nickel are found to play a crucial role in the stabilisation and thus isolation of these complexes. Preliminary reactivity studies demonstrate that the homoleptic lithium nickelates undergo stoichiometric cross&#8208;coupling with PhI to give dinickel clusters containing both anionic acetylide and neutral alkyne ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Arene Activation through Iminium Ions: Product Diversity from Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>While 2&#8208;alk&#8208;&#969;&#8208;enyloxy&#8208;sustituted benzaldehydes do not display any photochemical reactivity at the arene core, the respective iminium perchlorates were found to undergo efficient reactions either upon direct irradiation (&#955; = 366 nm) or under sensitizing conditions (&#955; = 420 nm, 2.5 mol% thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one). Three pathways were found: (a) Most commonly, the reaction led to benzoxacyclic products in which the olefin in the tether underwent a formal, yet unprecedented carboformylation (13 examples, 44&#8208;99% yield). The cascade process occurred with high diastereoselectivity and was found to be stereoconvergent. (b) If a substituent resides in the 3&#8208;position of the benzene ring, a  meta  photocycloaddition was observed which produced tetracyclic skeletons with five stereogenic centers in excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (2 examples, 58&#8208;79% yield). (c) If the tether was internally substituted at the alkene, an arene photocycloaddition was avoided and azetidines were formed in an aza Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction (2 examples, 95&#8208;98% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>Transmembrane Shuttling of Photosynthetically Produced Electrons to Propel Extracellular Biocatalytic Redox Reactions in a Modular Fashion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many biocatalytic redox reactions depend on the cofactor NAD(P)H, which may be provided by dedicated recycling systems. Exploiting light and water for NADPH&#8208;regeneration as it is performed, e.g., by cyanobacteria, is conceptually very appealing due to its high atom economy. However, the current use of cyanobacteria is limited, e.g. by challenging and time&#8208;consuming heterologous enzyme expression in cyanobacteria as well as limitations of substrate or product transport through the cell wall. Here we establish a transmembrane electron shuttling system propelled by the cyanobacterial photosynthesis to drive extracellular NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent redox reactions. The modular photo&#8208;electron shuttling (MPS) overcomes the need for cloning and problems associated with enzyme&#8208; or substrate&#8208;toxicity and substrate uptake. The MPS was demonstrated on four classes of enzymes with 19 enzymes and various types of substrates, reaching conversions of up to 99% and giving products with &gt;99% optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Switchable Palladium(II) Trefoil Entangled Tetrahedron with Temperature Dependence and Concentration Independence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly makes metallo&#8208;interlocked architectures attractive targets, but being in equilibrium with smaller species means that they can suffer from dilution effects. We show that a junctioned system gives rise to a [Pd  4  (L)  2  ]  8+  trefoil entangled tetrahedron irrespective of concentration. Heating the sample reversibly shifts the equilibrium from the knot to an isomeric non&#8208;interlocked dual metallo&#8208;cycle, demonstrating that thermodynamic equilibria can still be exploited for switching even in the absence of concentration effects.</dc:description>

Heating the sample reversibly shifts the equilibrium from the knot to an isomeric non-interlocked dual metallo-cycle, demonstrating that thermodynamic equilibria can still be exploited for switching even in the absence of concentration effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Physical and Chemical Cues at Nano&#8208;bio Interface for Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunomodulation has made remarkable achievements in fighting against infectious disease and cancer. Conventionally, immunomodulation largely relied on chemical/biochemical agents which, unfortunately, suffer from sever off&#8208;target adverse effects. Recent understandings on nano&#8208;bio interactions suggest that nanomaterials per se can directly participate in immunomodulation. A range of physical and chemical cues at nano&#8208;bio interface have been harnessed to regulate diverse immuno&#8208;signaling for disease control and treatment. In this Minireview, we summarize recent studies of the physical and chemical cues enabled by intrinsic nanomaterials that trigger immunological signaling. Firstly, we discuss physical cues mediated by surface topography, hydrophobicity, charge and heat at nano&#8208;bio interface for immunomodulation. Secondly, various chemical cues, such as metal species and oxidative species are outlined. Finally, our perspectives on the challenge and possible future directions are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Lifetime Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging has served as a primary method to collect information about complexed environments, providing detailed visualization of various entities with high clarity and differentiation. As an important branch of optical imaging, luminescence lifetime imaging exhibits significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetime. However, luminescence lifetime imaging based on traditional small molecular fluorophores with short lifetimes is not ideally suitable in some scenarios, such as  in vivo  imaging and multiplexed detection, where autofluorescence lifetimes in the same magnitude as molecular fluorophores would significantly interfere with the accurate detection of these probes. Thereby, great emphasis has been recently put into the exploration of lanthanide doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long&#8208;lived luminescence and easily tunable lifetimes. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter background signal during imaging, but also provides a wide lifetime tunable range while requiring less complexity in imaging system. In this review, we first introduced the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs. Then the key technologies including luminescence lifetime modulation and data acquisition of LnNPs were discussed in&#8208;depth. Several cutting&#8208;edge applications in the luminescence lifetime imaging system were introduced as well. Last part covered our prospects to inspire elaborate efforts for improved technologies and extended applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Barium Hydride Mediates Dinitrogen Fixation and Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated dinitrogen fixation has been intensively investigated. The employment of main group elements for this vital reaction recently aroused increasing interest because of new dinitrogen reaction chemistry. Herein, we report ammonia synthesis via a chemical looping process mediated by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free barium hydride (BaH  2  ). Experimental and computational studies reveal that the introduction of hydrogen vacancies is essential for creating coordinatively unsaturated multi&#8208;Ba sites for N  2  activation. The adjacent lattice hydridic hydrogen (H&#8254;) then undergoes both reductive elimination and reductive protonation to convert N  2  to NH  x  . The ammonia production rate supports this hydride&#8208;vacancy mechanism via a chemical looping route that is far exceeding that of a catalytic process. The BaH  2  &#8208;mediated chemical looping process has prospects for the future development toward ammonia synthesis using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The atroposelective synthesis of atropisomers with vicinal diaxes remains rare and challenging, due to the steric influence between the two axes and their unique topology.

The optically pure products bearing fluorophores show circular polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, being candidate materials for potential CPL applications. Atropisomerization experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to study the rotational barriers and rotation pathways of the diaxes.</dc:description>

         <title>Green and Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Biocatalysts Using Covalent Organic Frameworks as Enzyme Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme immobilization is essential to the commercial viability of various critical large&#8208;scale biocatalytic processes. However, vast challenges remain for the immobilization systems, such as difficulties in loading large enzymes, enzyme leaching, and limitations for large&#8208;scale fabrication. Herein, we describe a green and scalable strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance biocatalysts through in situ assembly of enzymes with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under ambient conditions (aqueous solution and room temperature). The obtained biocatalysts possess exceptional reusability and stability and serve as efficient biocatalysts for important industrial reactions that cannot be efficiently catalyzed by free enzymes or traditional enzyme immobilization systems. Notably, this versatile enzyme immobilization platform is applicable to various COFs and enzymes. The reactions in an aqueous solution occurred within a short timeframe (ca. 10&#8211;30 min) and could be scaled up readily (ca. 2.3 g per reaction).</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Theranostic Prodrug with Self&#8208;Sustainable Magnification Effect of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow theranostic prodrug that circumvents high background noise interference caused by external light excitation. The prodrug can release hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) in response to the high intratumoral peroxynitrite level associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD), and synchronously activate afterglow signal to monitor the drug release process and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor transformation. The prodrug itself is an ICD inducer achieved by photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT initiates ICD and recruits first&#8208;arrived neutrophils to secrete peroxynitrite to trigger HCPT release. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that HCPT can significantly amplify PDT&#8208;mediated ICD process. The prodrug thus shows a self&#8208;sustainable ICD magnification effect by establishing an &#8220;ICD&#8208;HCPT release&#8208;amplified ICD&#8221; cycling loop. In vivo studies demonstrate that prodrug can eradicate existing tumor and prevent further tumor recurrence through antitumor immune response.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxalate Oxidase for In Situ H2O2&#8208;generation in Unspecific Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Drug Oxyfunctionalisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H  2  O  2  &#8208;driven enzymes are of great interest for industrial biotransformations. Herein, we show for the first time that oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an efficient  in situ  source of H  2  O  2  for one of these biocatalysts, which is known as unspecific peroxygenase (UPO). OXO is reasonably robust, produces only CO  2  as a by&#8208;product and uses oxalate as a cheap sacrificial electron donor. UPO has significant potential as an industrial catalyst for selective C&#8208;H oxyfunctionalisations, as we confirm herein by testing a diverse drug panel using miniaturised high&#8208;throughput assays and mass spectrometry. 33 out of 64 drugs were converted in 5 &#181;L&#8208;scale reactions by the UPO with OXO (conversion &gt;70% for 11 drugs). Furthermore, oxidation of the drug tolmetin was achieved on a 50 mg scale (TON  UPO  25,664) with 84% yield, which was further improved via enzyme immobilization. This one&#8208;pot approach ensures adequate H  2  O  2  levels, enabling rapid access to industrially relevant molecules that are difficult to obtain by other routes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) from O  2  on single atom catalysts has attracted great attentions, yet the quest for robust catalysts is driven by achieving &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) under industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;100 mA cm  &#8208;2  ).

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Construction of Vicinal All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters via Iridium/Europium Bimetallic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters is a formidable task. We here report a synergistic bimetallic catalysis via a chiral  N,N'  &#8208;dioxide&#8208;europium (Eu) complex and a phosphoramidite&#8208;iridium (Ir) catalyst for the asymmetric allylation of oxindole derivatives by using challenging trisubstituted allylic esters.&#160;&#160;The allylated products bearing vicinal all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters were obtained with good diastereoselectivities (up to 20:1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Control experiments showed that the complementary diastereomers of the products were not accessible by the change of the stereochemistry of the chiral  N,N'  &#8208;dioxide ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic&#8208;Sieving of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene through a Novel Sulfonic Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering and tailoring of porous materials to realize the precise discrimination of CO2 and C2H2, with almost identical kinetic diameters, is a challenging task. We herein report the first example of the kinetic&#8208;sieving of relatively larger molecule of C2H2 from CO2 by a novel sulfonic anion&#8208;pillared hybrid ultramicroporous materials of ZU&#8208;610a. Specifically, ZU&#8208;610 constructed from copper(II), isonicotinic acid and 1,2&#8208;ethanedisulfonic acid is synthesized and shows the preferential affinity for C2H2 over CO2. After the post&#8208;synthetic heat treatment of ZU&#8208;610, ZU&#8208;610a with a contracted aperture is obtained. Interestingly, the C2H2&#8208;selctive ZU&#8208;610 was reversed to the CO2&#8208;selective ZU&#8208;610a. High purity C2H2 (&gt;99.5 %) could be directly obtained from the dynamic breakthrough experiments on an equimolar C2H2/ CO2 mixture at 298 K. This study provides guidance for the design of adsorbents aimed at separation systems with similar kinetic diameter.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydrogenative C&#8211;H Alkoxylation and Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past decade has witnessed a rapid progress in asymmetric C&#8211;H activation. However, the enantioselective C&#8211;H alkoxylation and amination with alcohols and free amines remains elusive. Herein, we disclose the first enantioselective dehydrogenative C&#8211;H alkoxylation and amination enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The use of cheap and readily available cobalt(II) salts as catalysts and Saloxs as chiral ligands provides an efficient method to access  P  &#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale preparation and further derivatizations of the resulting  P  &#8208;stereogenic phosphinamides, which offering a flexible asymmetric alternative to access  P  &#8208;stereogenic mono&#8208; and diphosphine chiral ligands. Preliminary mechanistic studies on the enantioselective C&#8211;H alkoxylation reaction suggest that a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle might be involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Catalysis in Stereodivergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic catalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for the development of new chemical reactions. Importantly, this strategy also provides a simple and powerful platform for stereodivergent synthesis in which all possible stereoisomers of products bearing two stereocenters could be easily prepared from the same set of starting materials. In this minireview, the development of stereodivergent allylic substitution, propargylic substitution, hydrofunctionalization, and annulation based on bimetallic catalysis has been summarized. It is expected that more novel bimetallic catalytic systems will be developed and applied for the stereodivergent synthesis of valuable molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Semiconducting Copolymers with Naphthalene Imide/Amide &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Units: Synthesis, Crystallography, and Systematic Structure&#8722;Property&#8722;Mobility Correlations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a series of n&#8208;type semiconducting naphthalene tetracarboxydiimide (NDI)&#8208;dithiophene (T2) copolymers, structural and electronic properties trends are systematically evaluated as the number of NDI carbonyl groups is reduced from 4 in NDI to 3 in NBL (1&#8208;amino&#8208;4,5&#8208;8&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;tricarboxylic acid&#8208;1,8&#8208;lactam&#8208;4,5&#8208;imide) to 2 in NBA (naphthalene&#8208;bis(4,8&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,5&#8208;dicarboxyl)&#8208;amide). As the NDI&#8208;T2 backbone torsional angle falls the LUMO energy rises. However, the thienyl attachment regiochemistry also plays an important role in less symmetric NBL and NBA. Electron mobility is greatest for N2200 (0.17 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) followed by PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2 and PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 (0.11 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1), 0.02 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 in PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2, and negligible in PNBA&#8208;3,7&#8208;T2. Charge transport reflects a delicate balance between electronic backbone communication (optimum for N2200 and PNBL&#8208;4,8&#8208;T2), backbone planarity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and PNBL&#8208;3,8&#8208;T2), LUMO energy (optimum for N2200), &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2), and film crystallinity (optimum for PNBA&#8208;2,6&#8208;T2 and N2200).

         <title>Ring&#8208;to&#8208;Thread Chirality Transfer in [2]Rotaxanes for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules is attracting a lot of attention in the last years, with applications in different fields, such as asymmetric catalysis or sensing. Herein we describe the synthesis of orientational mechanostereoisomers, which include a benzylic amide macrocycle with a stereogenic center, and non&#8208;symmetric  N  &#8208;(arylmethyl)fumaramides as the axis. The base&#8208;promoted cyclization of the initial fumaramide thread allows the obtention of enantioenriched value&#8208;added compounds, like lactams of different ring sizes and aminoacids. The chiral information is effectively transmitted across the mechanical bond from the encircling ring to the interlocked lactam. High levels of enantioselectivity and full control of the regioselectivity of the final cyclic compounds are attained.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective, Catalytic Access to Cross&#8208;aldol Products Directly from Esters and Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High oxidation&#8208;state carbonyl coupling partners including esters and lactones were reacted with enones to give aldol&#8208;type products directly using two&#8208;fold organoborane catalysis. This new retrosynthetic disconnection to aldol&#8208;type products is compatible with enolisable coupling partners, without self&#8208;condensation, and couples the high reactivity of secondary dialkylboranes with the stability of pinacolboronic esters. Excellent chemoselectivity, substrate scope (including those containing reducible functionalities and free alcohols) and diastereocontrol were achieved to access both the  syn  &#8208; and  anti  &#8208;aldol&#8208;type products. Mechanistic studies confirmed the two&#8208;fold catalytic role of the single secondary borane catalyst; boron enolate formation and formation of an aldehyde surrogate from the ester coupling parter.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Adaptability and Concerted Structural Response in a Bismuth Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalyst.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly robust bismuth MOF shows an unusual concerted structural response involving changes in inorganic building units upon binding of guest species at different sites. The MOF is an active catalyst for the Strecker reaction.







Abstract
Bismuth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as heterogeneous catalysts are scarce, and there is little knowledge on the influence of the MOF features on their resulting activity and behavior. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity in the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Strecker reaction with ketones of three new MOFs prepared with the combination of indium or bismuth and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid. One of them, denoted BiPF&#8208;7, is very robust and chemically stable, and demonstrates a high activity in the formation of the desired &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. The interaction of the catalytic substrates with the metal centers in this MOF has been crystallographically characterized, showcasing a concerted framework adaptability process that involves structural changes in framework components that are not directly involved in the binding of the guests.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultra&#8208;Microporosity for Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation at High Temperature and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;microporous zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is used for CO2 capture over C2H2 to obtain highly pure C2H2 directly. The material not only shows high separation performance at low temperatures but also at high temperatures and humidities.







Abstract
Separation of CO2/C2H2 to obtain pure C2H2 presents a challenge for the chemical industry. CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents are favored because of the convenient separation process. However, there are only a few CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO2 from CO2/C2H2, and there is almost no research on CO2/C2H2 separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO2/C2H2 at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO2 with almost no C2H2 taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO2/C2H2, and highly pure C2H2 is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333&#8197;K with 18.12&#8201;% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.

         <title>Cocrystallization Enabled Spatial Self&#8208;Confinement Approach to Synthesize Crystalline Porous Metal Oxide Nanosheets for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach has been developed to synthesize crystalline porous two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets. The mechanism is proposed and various crystalline porous metal oxides nanosheets can be obtained. The resulting crystalline porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets show exceptional sensing performance towards 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.







Abstract
Crystalline metal oxide nanosheets show exceptional catalytic performance owing to the large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and quantum confinement effect. However, it is still a challenge to develop a facile and general method to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Herein, we report a cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Taking the synthesis of SnO2 as an example, the solvent evaporation from KCl and SnCl2 solution induces the cocrystallization of KCl and K2SnCl6, and the obtained composite with encapsulated K2SnCl6 can be in situ converted into SnO2 nanosheets confined in KCl matrix, after water washing to remove KCl, porous SnO2 nanosheets can be obtained. Notably, a series of metal oxide nanosheets can be obtained through this general and efficient green route. In particular, porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets with improved surface O&#8722; species and abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit superior gas sensing performance to 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Highly Efficient High Salinity Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel as highly efficient solar evaporator is developed for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. The hydrogel evaporator could achieve a rapid solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with high energy efficiency (&#8776;94&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel offers insight to design next&#8208;generation solar evaporators for high&#8208;salinity brine.







Abstract
Interfacial solar vapor generation (SVG) is regarded as a promising and sustainable strategy for clean water production. While many materials have demonstrated excellent evaporation rates under one sun, it remains challenging to design solar evaporators without compromising SVG performance in high&#8208;salinity brines (&#8805;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Herein, polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) are proposed as a novel platform for high&#8208;salinity solar desalination. Taking advantage of the unique anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, PZHs can trap salt ions from the brine water to form a more hydrated polymer network, leading to enhanced SVG performance. PZHs exhibit an exceptional solar evaporation rate of 4.14&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% brine, which is &#8776;20&#8201;% higher than that in pure water. It is anticipated that salt&#8208;responsive PZHs may provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation solar desalination systems.

         <title>Diborylmethyl Group as a Transformable Building Block for the Diversification of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established an efficient protocol for the preparation of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their use in homologative coupling with nitrogen nucleophiles to generate various nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes. The diborylmethyl group installed onto the nitrogen atom served as a versatile synthetic handle, allowing for the programmed diversification of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
The development of new approaches to installing diverse carbon fragments to a nitrogen atom has attracted considerable attention in chemical science. While numerous strategies have been devised to forge C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds, one conceptually powerful and straightforward approach is to insert a transformable sp3&#8208;carbon unit onto a nitrogen atom for modular diversification. Here we describe the successful synthesis of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their applications to the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes through their homologative coupling with a variety of nitrogen nucleophiles including biologically relevant molecules. This process exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, and the usefulness of the obtained compounds is demonstrated by the modular diversification of the diborylmethyl group to access various nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Crystal Structure Based Mutagenesis of Cattleyene Synthase Leads to the Generation of Rearranged Polycyclic Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the diterpene synthase CyS was solved, providing the structural basis for cattleyene biosynthesis. A CySC59A mutant generated diterpenes with novel carbon skeletons. The remarkable cyclization mechanism of one of these products was characterized by isotopic labeling experiments.







Abstract
The crystal structures of cattleyene synthase (apo&#8208;CyS), and CyS complexed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were solved. The CySC59A variant exhibited an increased production of cattleyene and other diterpenes with diverse skeletons. Its structure showed a widened active site cavity explaining the relaxed selectivity. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed a remarkable cyclization mechanism involving several skeletal rearrangements for one of the novel diterpenes.

         <title>One&#8208;For&#8208;All Polyolefin Functionalization: Active Ester as Gateway to Combine Insertion Polymerization with ROP, NMP, and RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyolefin active ester exchange (PACE) process was developed for polyolefin&#8208;containing block copolymer synthesis and serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. As reported by Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, Eva Harth et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205931), PACE allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials which comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.

         <dc:description>
Realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence is highly desirable in chemistry and materials fields. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202208735), Yan et&#8197;al. report highly efficient and direct ultralong all&#8208; phosphorescence from transparent MOF glasses which are made by a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. This work provides an alternative way to synthesize new MOF glasses with highly efficient utilization of triplet excitons and extends the function of color&#8208;tunable ultralong RTP into advanced photonic applications.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic catalysis of a dipeptide phosphonium salt and a Lewis acid is reported by Zhishan Su, Tianli Wang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207334) for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] ring systems. The picture shows the key transition state of the reaction, with the phosphonium salt placed on the left top, and the substrates of vinyl sulfone and cyclic imine on the left and right bottom, respectively. The silver nitrite in the center connects the catalyst and substrate with &#8220;lightnings&#8221; that symbolize hydrogen&#8208;bonding and coordination interactions. Via the transition state, the product &#8220;flies out&#8221; and appears on the right top.

         <title>Like Recycles Like: Selective Ring&#8208;Closing Depolymerization of Poly(L&#8211;Lactic Acid) to L&#8211;Lactide</title>

Closed&#8208;loop recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) to L&#8208;lactide (LLA) was enabled owing to specific solvent interactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204531), Karin Odelius and co&#8208;workers show how the ceiling temperature (Tc) depends on, not only concentration, but also on solvent properties. This was utilized to lower the recycling temperature of PLLA, resulting in direct ring&#8208;closing depolymerization of high molecular weight PLLA to the cyclic monomer LLA with high yield and high selectivity.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Aluminum Coordination Environments in Mordenite Zeolite and Their Role in the Dimethyl Ether (DME) Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Part of tetrahedral framework aluminum in a protonic mordenite (HMOR) will convert geometry to distorted tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. High&#8208;field 27Al NMR data show that more framework Al atoms at T3 and T4 sites change geometry to nonframework structures than others. These nonframework Al species preferentially reside in the side pockets, which will decrease the accessibility of acid sites in the 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) channel, impairing the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction. The arisen octahedrally coordinated Al species are framework&#8208;associated, which can be reverted into the zeolite framework. Herein, we find that a facile treatment with pyridine could force the octahedral coordination Al back into a tetrahedral environment, which could increase the number of available active sites and enhance the diffusion of DME, thus improving the reactivity (4 times) of the DME carbonylation reaction and prolonging the lifetime of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;in&#8208;One Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Long&#8208;Lived Luminescent Systems Based on Pyrene&#8208;Doped Amorphous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived luminescent systems are developed based on pyrene&#8208;doped polymers, where the phosphorescence exhibits radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics at the same time.







Abstract
Materials exhibiting ultralong luminescent lifetime show promising applications in the fields of information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;cost and general strategy to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on pyrene chromophores doped into polymer matrices. The UOP of the resulted systems presents radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics. The UOP color can be turned from blue to red by changing the excitation wavelength or the concentration of chromophores. Experimental results prove that these characteristics are attributed to the consumption of triplet oxygen and the different aggregation states of chromophores in the polymer matrices. Finally, we demonstrate that these systems could be applied for multilevel information encryption. This work would promote further development of multi&#8208;responsive long&#8208;lived luminescent materials.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Shell Engineering of a Au28 Nanocluster Boosts Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboranethiolate&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28&#8208;S was fabricated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S has an identical metal core to the reported Au28&#8208;C but different peripheral ligands. This ligand&#8208;shell tailoring led to obvious differences in their electronic structures and optical properties. Compared to Au28&#8208;C, Au28&#8208;S shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Subtle tailoring of gold nanoclusters (NCs) could significantly change their physicochemical properties. However, direct comparison of the catalytic performance of gold NCs with identical metal cores but distinct ligand shells is rarely elucidated. In this work, a novel gold NC, Au28(C2B10H11S)12(tht)4Cl4 (Au28&#8208;S), was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reducing synthesis. Au28&#8208;S adopts an identical Au28 metal framework to that of the reported alkynyl&#8208;protected Au28&#8208;C. The different protective layers lead to distinctions in their electronic structure and optical properties. Furthermore, Au28&#8208;S shows better catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. Theoretical calculations identified the active sites and shed light on the catalytic mechanism to elucidate the different catalytic performances. This work provides an ideal platform to study the protective layer&#8208;activity relationship of gold NCs, and may also provide guidance in the design of metal NC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Imide&#8208;Functionalized Fluorenone and Its Cyanated Derivative Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Thin&#8208;Film Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imide&#8208;functionalization of fluorenone and its cyanated derivative afforded new acceptors FOI and FCNI, respectively, featuring excellent solubility, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO, which enabled the resulting polymers with unique n&#8208;type transport character in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. The design strategy and synthetic routes to FOI and FCNI are highly informative for the further development of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties. By meticulously installing an imide group onto fluorene and its cyanated derivative, we report here two very electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, imide&#8208;functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI), both featuring a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level down to &#8722;4.05&#8197;eV and highly coplanar framework, endowing them ideal units for constructing n&#8208;type polymers. Thus, a series of polymers are built from them, exhibiting unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a highest electron mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Hence, FOI and FCNI offer a remarkable platform for accessing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and the imide functionalization of appropriate (hetero)arenes is a powerful strategy for developing polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMOs for n&#8208;type organic electronics.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Melanin&#8211;Protein&#8211;Fe/Cu Conjugates Derived from Norepinephrine as Reliable Models for Neuromelanin of Human Brain Locus Coeruleus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8211;protein conjugates derived from norepinephrine fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin were synthesized as soluble models of neuromelanin from human brain locus coeruleus. This pigment contains a significant amount of iron and copper. The synthetic models show that the two metals exhibit a strong tendency to remain coupled to each other in dinuclear or multinuclear aggregates.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble melanin&#8208;protein&#8208;Fe/Cu conjugates derived from norepinephrine and fibrillar &#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin are reliable models for neuromelanin (NM) of human brain locus coeruleus. Both iron and copper promote catecholamine oxidation and exhibit strong tendency to remain coupled in oligonuclear aggregates. The Fe&#8208;Cu clusters are EPR silent and affect the 1H NMR spectra of the conjugates through a specific sequence of signals. Derivatives containing only Fe or Cu exhibit different NMR patterns. The EPR spectra show weak signals of paramagnetic FeIII in conjugates containing Fe or mixed Fe&#8208;Cu sites due to small amounts of mononuclear centers. The latter derivatives exhibit EPR signals for isolated CuII centers. These features parallel the EPR behavior of NM from locus coeruleus. The spectral data indicate that FeIII is bound to the melanic fraction, whereas CuII is bound on the protein fibrils, suggesting that the Fe&#8208;Cu clusters occur at the interface between the two components of the synthetic NMs.

         <title>Access to Unexplored 3D Chemical Space: cis&#8208;Selective Arene Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Saturated Cyclic Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel and unexplored saturated cyclic boronic acids were synthesized using an arene hydrogenation methodology. Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cis&#8208;selective hydrogenation of biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin&#8208;derivatives is reported. The utility of the synthesized molecules was shown by their high tendency to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding and molecular recognition under physiological conditions.







Abstract
A new class of saturated boron&#8208;incorporated cyclic molecules has been synthesized employing an arene&#8208;hydrogenation methodology. cis&#8208;Selective hydrogenation of easily accessible, and biologically important molecules comprising benzoxaborole, benzoxaborinin, and benzoxaboripin derivatives is reported. Among the various catalysts tested, rhodium cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene [Rh&#8208;CAAC] (1) pre&#8208;catalyst revealed the best hydrogenation activity confirming turnover number up to 1400 with good to high diastereoselectivity. A broad range of functional groups was tolerated including sensitive substituents such as &#8722;F, &#8722;CF3, and &#8722;silyl groups. The utility of the synthesized products was demonstrated by the recognition of diols and sugars under physiological conditions. These motifs can have a substantial importance in medicinal chemistry as they possess a three&#8208;dimensional structure, are highly stable, soluble in water, form hydrogen bonds, and interact with diols and sugars.

Well&#8208;defined interfaces were constructed that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of CH4 to C2H4 plays an important role in the light olefin industry. Here, we report the electrochemical conversion of CH4 to C2H4/C2H6 at the anode with the electrolysis of CO2 to CO at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser. We constructed well&#8208;defined interfaces that function as three&#8208;phase boundaries by exsolving single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths. We engineered the chemical states and flux of active oxygen species for the oxidation of CH4 at the anode by controlling voltage and temperature. We show the unprecedented C2 selectivity (C2H4 and C2H6) of &#8805;99.5&#8201;% at a CH4 conversion of &#8776;7&#8201;%. The electrolyser exhibits excellent durability without performance degradation being observed in a continuous operation of 100&#8197;hours. Our work enables a novel path for the selective conversion of CH4/CO2 into useful chemicals, and the technique of building well&#8208;defined interfaces may find potential applications in other fields.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Overproduction of Biofuels in Microorganisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>

A hybrid photo&#8208;biosynthesis system was constructed for the overproduction of jet fuel farnesene by interfacing engineered E.&#8197;coli with persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3). meso&#8208;Al2O3 with rich defects prolonged the lifetime of photo&#8208;excited electrons that were passed to E.&#8197;coli and improved the farnesene production by a factor of over 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories reinvigorate current industries by producing complex fine chemicals at low costs. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the main reducing power to drive the biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. However, insufficient intrinsic NADPH limits the productivity of microorganisms. Here, we report that supplying microorganisms with long&#8208;lived electrons from persistent phosphor mesoporous Al2O3 (meso&#8208;Al2O3) can elevate the NADPH level to facilitate efficient fine chemical production. The defects in meso&#8208;Al2O3 were demonstrated to be highly efficient in prolonging electrons&#8217; lifetime. The long&#8208;lived electrons in meso&#8208;Al2O3 can pass the material&#8211;microorganism interface and power the biosynthetic pathways of E.&#8197;coli to produce jet fuel farnesene. This work represents a reliable strategy to design photo&#8208;biosynthesis systems to improve the productivity of microorganisms with solar energy.

         <title>Aminal&#8208;Linked Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Framework for Rapid Photocatalytic Decontamination of Mustard&#8208;Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF) was synthesized to detoxify the mustard&#8208;gas simulant 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Compared with imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF demonstrates higher photooxidation of CEES into 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO). The COF linkages contribute to an intersystem crossing process and enhance the photochemical properties of the catalyst.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are appealing photocatalysts for toxic chemical degradation. Great efforts have been devoted to regulate the photocatalytic performance of COFs by tuning their organic building blocks, but the relationship between COF linkage and photochemical properties has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a novel aminal&#8208;linked porphyrinic COF, namely Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF. Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF (0.25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the detoxification of the sulfur mustard simulant with a half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 5&#8197;min, which is far lower than that of traditional imine&#8208;linked Por&#8208;COF (t1/2=16&#8197;min). Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the aminal linkages of Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF facilitated the intersystem crossing process. Thus, Por&#8208;Aminal&#8208;COF showed higher triplet&#8208;state generation efficiency compared with Por&#8208;COF, consequently promoting the activation of oxygen molecular to singlet oxygen.

         <title>Electrostatic Secondary&#8208;Sphere Interactions That Facilitate Rapid and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere interactions provide precise and systematic control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity and activity in a Fe&#8208;porphyrin based MOF. Specifically, we show that MOFs allow the incorporation of molecular catalysts and positively&#8208;charged ligands one next to the other, in a manner which promotes catalysis by stabilization of reactive intermediates during electrochemical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms for heterogeneous tethering of molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Yet, to further understand electrocatalytic MOF systems, one also needs to consider their capability to fine&#8208;tune the immediate chemical environment of the active site, and thus affect its overall catalytic operation. Here, we show that electrostatic secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities enable substantial improvement of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity and selectivity. In situ Raman analysis reveal that immobilization of pendent positively&#8208;charged groups adjacent to MOF&#8208;residing Fe&#8208;porphyrin catalysts, stabilize weakly&#8208;bound CO intermediates, allowing their rapid release as catalytic products. Also, by varying the electrolyte's ionic strength, systematic regulation of electrostatic field magnitude was achieved, resulting in essentially 100&#8201;% CO selectivity. Thus, this concept provides a sensitive molecular&#8208;handle that adjust heterogeneous electrocatalysis on demand.

         <title>Nitric&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Releasing aza&#8208;BODIPY: A New Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent attachment of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties to aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives affords the first NO&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate of BDP&#8208;NO. The delicate modulation of the aggregation states of BDP&#8208;NO enables different antibacterial modalities, and the combination of NO release and photothermal therapy (PTT) can synergistically treat MRSA infections while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammatory responses.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) J&#8208;aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine&#8208;containing aza&#8208;BODIPY precursor (BDP&#8208;NH2), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing NIR J&#8208;aggregate (BDP&#8208;NO). The introduction of N&#8208;nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of BDP&#8208;NH2, which instead promotes the formation of J&#8208;aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of &#8776;109&#8197;nm to the NIR window (820&#8197;nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of BDP&#8208;NO within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT&#8208;associated inflammation for the in vivo treatment of MRSA infection.

     alt="Nitric-Oxide-Releasing aza-BODIPY: A New Near-Infrared J-Aggregate with Multiple Antibacterial Modalities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covalent attachment of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosamine moieties to aza-BODIPY derivatives affords the first NO-releasing NIR J-aggregate of &lt;b&gt;BDP-NO&lt;/b&gt;. The delicate modulation of the aggregation states of &lt;b&gt;BDP-NO&lt;/b&gt; enables different antibacterial modalities, and the combination of NO release and photothermal therapy (PTT) can synergistically treat MRSA infections while attenuating PTT-associated inflammatory responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of near-infrared (NIR) J-aggregates has received increasing attention due to their broad applications. Here, we report the nitrosation of an amine-containing aza-BODIPY precursor (&lt;b&gt;BDP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), affording the first nitric oxide (NO)-releasing NIR J-aggregate (&lt;b&gt;BDP-NO&lt;/b&gt;). The introduction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosamine moieties efficiently inhibits the aromatic interactions of &lt;b&gt;BDP-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which instead promotes the formation of J-aggregates within micellar nanoparticles with a remarkable bathochromic shift of &#8776;109&#8197;nm to the NIR window (820&#8197;nm). Interestingly, the NO release and photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) can be delicately tuned by the loading contents of &lt;b&gt;BDP-NO&lt;/b&gt; within micellar nanoparticles, thereby enabling multiple antibacterial modalities by exploring either NO release, photothermal therapy (PTT), or both. We demonstrate the combination of NO and PTT can elevate antibacterial activity while attenuating PTT-associated inflammation for the in vivo treatment of MRSA infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective Total Syntheses of Five Lycopodium Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective total syntheses of five Lycopodium alkaloids were accomplished in an enantioselective and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. The syntheses included a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;alkyne cycloisomerization and the establishment of skeletal diversification approaches at different reactive sites of the tricyclic skeleton to achieve divergent total syntheses of Lycopodium alkaloids.







Abstract
It is reported herein that by exploiting the commonly shared bicyclic decahydroquinoline motif, a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;alkyne cycloisomerization reaction is developed to access tricyclic cores in a simple way. These tricyclic cores further serve as an advanced platform for the divergent enantioselective collective total syntheses of five Lycopodium alkaloids, belonging to three different structural types, in a concise and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free fashion. The key transformations in the second phase include: 1)&#8197;a transannular reductive Heck cyclization for installation of the azepane ring in fawcettidine, fawcettimine, and lycoposerramine&#8197;Q; 2)&#8197;a domino Mukaiyama hydration/Grob fragmentation process for construction of the ten&#8208;membered lactam system in phlegmariurine&#8197;B; 3)&#8197;a Fukuyama one&#8208;pot protocol for the construction of the 2&#8208;pyridone motif in lycoposerramine&#8197;R. The newly developed strategy is expected to pave the way for the synthesis of other structurally related Lycopodium alkaloids.

         <title>Back&#8208;Gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;Tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microcell&#8208;based in&#8197;situ electronic/electrochemical system was designed to unlock the fixed charge transfer of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction under an electric field. The charges across the van der Waals (vdW) channel distribute to three Mo atoms adjacent to S vacancies and strengthen Mo&#8722;H bonding. The catalyst design enables precise regulation of the electronic configuration.







Abstract
Charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Establishing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies beyond conventional methods. We describe exertion of an external electric field in the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the band gap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. In&#8197;situ photoluminescence spectra and gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement reveal a linear correlation between the charge accumulation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. This approach provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity.

         <title>VPO4F Fluorophosphates Polyanion Cathodes for High&#8208;Voltage Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal criterion for proton cathodes was put forward combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, which might pave a new way for exploiting electrode materials for proton batteries. As a result, vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with high capacity.







Abstract
Proton batteries are emerging in electrochemical energy storage because of the associated fast kinetics, low cost and high safety. However, their development is hindered by the relatively low energy density due to the limited choice of cathode materials. Herein, metal phosphate polyanion cathodes are proposed as the proton cathode for the first time. Combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, a universal criterion for the proton cathode was put forward. Vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with a specific capacity of 116&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high potential of 1.0&#8197;V (vs. SHE). The proton insertion/extraction mechanism in the VPO4F electrode was also verified through X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the stability of VPO4F was investigated in various electrolytes and the optimized electrolyte enabled the stable operation of VPO4F for 300&#8197;cycles. This work provides new inspiration in the exploitation of new electrode materials for electrochemical proton storage devices.

A pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective aromatic nucleophilic cage B(4)&#8208;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a class of B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes is reported. In the presence of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbpy) and magnesium complex, B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes can undergo cage isomerization to afford B(2)&#8208;aminated m&#8208;carboranes at as low as 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The nucleophilic aromatic BH substitution reaction of carboranes is uncommon, compared to the electrophilic one. This work reported a pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective nucleophilic aromatic cage B(4)&#8208;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a series of B(4)&#8208;aminated o&#8208;carboranes. DFT calculations showcased a stepwise B&#8722;N formation/B&#8722;H cleavage process, in which Mg&#8722;H formation/cage closure is the rate&#8208;determining step. Unprecedentedly, in the presence of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbpy), a tandem B(4)&#8208;amination/cage isomerization reaction of o&#8208;carboranes was discovered for the facile preparation of B(2)&#8208;aminated m&#8208;carboranes. Control experiments indicated that magnesium complex, bidentate ligand (dtbpy) and reaction temperature were crucial in the cage isomerization process. This direct nucleophilic aromatic cage B&#8722;H amination reaction offers an alternative strategy for selective amination of o&#8208; and m&#8208;carboranes.

Control experiments indicated that magnesium complex, bidentate ligand (dtbpy) and reaction temperature were crucial in the cage isomerization process. This direct nucleophilic aromatic cage B&#8722;H amination reaction offers an alternative strategy for selective amination of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-carboranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Convergent Synthesis and Anti&#8208;Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth Activity of a Highly Branched Heptadecasaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius has been accomplished via a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy. This work demonstrates a representative example to explore potential active domains of the polysaccharide for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies, thereby facilitating pharmaceutical development.







Abstract
Bioactive polysaccharides from natural resources target various biological processes and are increasingly used as potential target molecules for drug development. However, the accessibility of branched and long complex polysaccharide active domains with well&#8208;defined structures remains a major challenge. Herein we describe an efficient first total synthesis of a highly branched heptadecasaccharide moiety of the native bioactive galectin&#8208;3&#8208;targeting polysaccharide from Carthamus tinctorius L. as well as shorter fragments of the heptadecasaccharide. The key feature of the approach is that a photo&#8208;assisted convergent [6+4+7] one&#8208;pot coupling strategy enables rapid assembly of the heptadecasaccharide, whereby a photoremovable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group is used to generate the corresponding acceptor for glycosylation in situ upon ultraviolet radiation. Biological activity tests suggest that the heptadecasaccharide can target galectin&#8208;3 and inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth.

         <title>Molecular Inhibition for Selective CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular modifiers can be used to alter the product selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. In this study, immobilisation of a well&#8208;defined pyridine species on a copper catalyst inhibits CO and C2+ product formation, enabling the selective generation of formate at high reaction rates.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a sustainable route to the production of chemicals and fuels. Achieving a narrow product distribution with heterogeneous Cu catalysts is challenging and conventional material modifications offer limited control over selectivity. Here, we show that surface&#8208;immobilised molecular species can act as inhibitors for specific carbon products to provide rational control over product distributions. Combined experimental and computational results showed that anchoring of a thiol&#8208;functionalised pyridine on Cu destabilises a surface&#8208;bound reaction intermediate to energetically block a CO&#8208;producing pathway, thereby favouring formate production. The nitrogen atom was shown to be essential to the inhibition mechanism. The ability of molecules to control selectivity through inhibition of specific reaction pathways offers a unique approach to rationally modify heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Homochiral Multiferroic Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Dimetallic Complexes Assembled by C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homochiral multiferroic dimetallic cyanides were constructed by the introduction of rarely seen C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K interactions, which show a saturated polarization of 9.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, larger than those of other ferroelectric dimetallic cyanides.







Abstract
Cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are attracting attention due to their varied structures and properties. However, homochiral cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic complexes are rare, and making them ferroelectric is a great challenge. Introducing C&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;K interactions between the guest chiral cations and the host [KFe(CN)6]2&#8722; framework, gives three&#8208;dimensional cyanido&#8208;bridged dimetallic multiferroics, [R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium]2[KFe(CN)6] (R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;FPC). The mirror&#8208;symmetric vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) signal shows their enantiomeric nature. R&#8208; and S&#8208;3&#8208;FPC crystallize in the same chiral&#8208;polar space group P21 at 298&#8197;K. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), polarizing optical microscopy, and temperature&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements show their multiferroic properties (the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity), in line with the Aizu notation of 222F2. R&#8208;3&#8208;FPC shows excellent ferroelectricity with saturated polarization up to 9.4&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

A biomimetic synthetic strategy has resulted in a two&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;ulodione&#8197;A and the prediction of two potential natural products, (&#177;)&#8208;ulodiones&#8197;C and D. This work was guided by computational investigations into the selectivity of a proposed biosynthetic Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization, which was then utilized in the chemical synthesis.

         <title>Unveiling the Proton&#8208;Feeding Effect in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doping in the second coordination shell of FeN4 induces the increased CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance relative to pristine FeN4. The proton&#8208;feeding effect after sulfur doping is demonstrated to promote protonation of *CO2 to *COOH, and thus CO2RR performances, through kinetic analysis, in situ characterization and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doping in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is considered a powerful strategy to promote the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the origin of enhanced catalytic activity is still elusive. Here, we disclose that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton&#8208;feeding effect for CO2RR. The model SAC catalyst with sulfur doping in the second&#8208;shell of FeN4 (Fe1&#8722;NSC) was verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Fe1&#8722;NSC exhibits superior CO2RR performance compared to sulfur&#8208;free FeN4 and most reported Fe&#8208;based SACs, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 98.6&#8201;% and turnover frequency of 1197&#8197;h&#8722;1. Kinetic analysis and in situ characterizations confirm that sulfur doping accelerates H2O activation and feeds sufficient protons for promoting CO2 conversion to *COOH, which is also corroborated by the theoretical results. This work deepens the understanding of the CO2RR mechanism based on SAC catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-doping in the second coordination shell of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; induces the increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) performance relative to pristine FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The proton-feeding effect after sulfur doping is demonstrated to promote protonation of *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to *COOH, and thus CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performances, through kinetic analysis, in situ characterization and DFT calculations.

         <title>Methylamine Lithium Borohydride as Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion conductor based on methylamine lithium borohydride is reported. The new compound crystallizes in a layered two&#8208;dimensional structure with fast Li&#8208;ion migration in the interlayers. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as electrolyte is demonstrated with Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode material.







Abstract
Fast Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature is a major challenge for utilization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries. Metal borohydrides with neutral ligands are a new emerging class of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors, and here we report the discovery of a new mono&#8208;methylamine lithium borohydride with very fast Li+ conductivity at room temperature. LiBH4&#8901;CH3NH2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, forming a two&#8208;dimensional unique layered structure. The layers are separated by hydrophobic &#8722;CH3 moieties, and contain large voids, allowing for fast Li&#8208;ionic conduction in the interlayers, &#963;(Li+)=1.24&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The electronic conductivity is negligible, and the electrochemical stability is &#8776;2.1&#8197;V vs Li. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as the electrolyte, Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode is demonstrated.

         <title>Enzymatic Enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydration of Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene monooxygenase catalyzed enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of aryl alkenes, rather than epoxidation, was made possible by simply removing oxygen from the reaction mixture. An acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate enabled the reaction with excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity.







Abstract
The addition of water to alkenes is an important method for the synthesis of alcohols, but the regioselectivity of acid&#8208;catalyzed hydration of terminal alkenes yields secondary alcohols according to Markovnikov's rule, making it difficult to obtain primary alcohols. Here we report a styrene monooxygenase that catalyzes the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of the terminal aryl alkenes under anaerobic conditions. This hydration provides primary alcohols in good yields (up to 100&#8201;%), excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1), and good enantiomeric purity (60&#8211;83&#8201;% ee). Residues Asn46, Asp100, and Asn309 are essential for catalysis suggesting an acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate that could account for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity. Our work reveals a new enzymatic tool with unusual regioselectivity based on the promiscuous catalytic activity of a monooxygenase.

Abstract
The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective, intermolecular vicinal fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes has been achieved by enantioselective II/IIII catalysis. Leveraging C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol&#8208;based aryl iodide catalysts, it has been possible to intercept the transient iodonium intermediate using simple nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile. In situ Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89&#8201;% yield, e.r. 93&#8201;:&#8201;7). This main group catalysis paradigm inverts the intrinsic regioselectivity of the uncatalyzed process, thereby providing facile access to tertiary, benzylic stereocenters bearing both CF3 and F groups. Privileged phenethylamine pharmacophores can be generated in which there is complete local partial charge inversion (CF3&#948;&#8722;/F&#948;&#8722; versus CH3&#948;+/H&#948;+). Crystallographic analyses of representative &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products reveal highly pre&#8208;organized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic gauche effect.

         <title>Ru&#8211;Co Pair Sites Catalyst Boosts the Energetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination manipulation strategy is proposed to achieve near&#8208;optimal adsorption energies for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates by constructing an atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co paired site on LiCoO2. Benefitting from the strong electronic interaction between Ru and Co, the Ru&#8722;Co/LiCoO2 nanosheets exhibit accelerated charge transfer capability, strengthened Co&#8722;O covalency, optimized eg filling, and then the resulting superior OER activity.







Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment of the active center via anion modulation to reveal tailored activity and selectivity has been widely achieved, especially for carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs). However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single&#8208;site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing a Ru/LiCoO2 SAC with atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near&#8208;optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000&#8197;A&#8201;goxide&#8722;1 at a small overpotential of 335&#8197;mV, and excellent long&#8208;term stability.

     alt="Ru&#8211;Co Pair Sites Catalyst Boosts the Energetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single-site Ru cation coordination manipulation strategy is proposed to achieve near-optimal adsorption energies for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates by constructing an atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co paired site on LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Benefitting from the strong electronic interaction between Ru and Co, the Ru&#8722;Co/LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets exhibit accelerated charge transfer capability, strengthened Co&#8722;O covalency, optimized e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; filling, and then the resulting superior OER activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the coordination environment of the active center via anion modulation to reveal tailored activity and selectivity has been widely achieved, especially for carbon-based single-atom site catalysts (SACs). However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single-site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single-site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing a Ru/LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SAC with atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near-optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;oxide&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a small overpotential of 335&#8197;mV, and excellent long-term stability. It also exhibits rapid kinetics with superior rate capability and outstanding durability in a zinc&#8211;air battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ball Milling Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Prussian Blue Analogue Na2&#8722;xMnFe(CN)6 Cathodes for All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, cost&#8208;efficient, and general programmable ball&#8208;milling synthesis process without any additives was designed to prepare highly crystalline MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170. The constructed sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) based on the above MnHCF&#8208;S&#8208;170 can adapt to the complex and fickle working environment, and demonstrate possible practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.







Abstract
With a series of merits, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been considered as superior cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Their commercialization, however, still suffers from inferior stability, considerable [Fe(CN)6] defects and interstitial water in the framework, which are related to the rapid crystal growth. Herein, a &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air&#8208;stability, all&#8208;climate, and full&#8208;cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water&#8208;based co&#8208;precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques. This work could pave the way for the PBA&#8208;based SIBs in grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Optimizing Pt Electronic States through Formation of a Schottky Junction on Non&#8208;reducible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum nanoparticles are supported on different MOFs, including non&#8208;reducible ZIF&#8208;8 and reducible UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125. Unexpectedly, the Pt/ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits higher activity than Pt/UiO&#8208;66 and Pt/MIL&#8208;125 in the photocatalytic benzylamine oxidative coupling reaction. The different electron transfer behaviors among these photocatalysts lead to the highest Pt electron density on ZIF&#8208;8 toward O2 activation, accounting for its superior activity.







Abstract
Charge transfer between metal sites and supports is crucial for catalysis. Redox&#8208;inert supports are usually unfavorable due to their less electronic interaction with metal sites, which, we demonstrate, is not always correct. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are chosen to mimic inert or active supports for Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and the photocatalysis is studied. Results demonstrate the formation of a Schottky junction between Pt and the MOFs, leading to the electron&#8208;donation effect of the MOFs. Under light irradiation, both the MOF electron&#8208;donation effect and Pt interband excitation dominate the Pt electron density. Compared with the &#8220;active&#8221; UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;125 supports, Pt NPs on the &#8220;inert&#8221; ZIF&#8208;8 exhibit higher electron density due to the higher Schottky barrier, resulting in superior photocatalytic activity. This work optimizes metal catalysts with non&#8208;reducible supports, and promotes the understanding of the relationship between the metal&#8211;support interaction and photocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 2D Hybrid Double Perovskites on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 Crystals towards Ultrasensitive Detection of Weak Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of 2D/3D lead&#8208;free double perovskite heterocrystals (HCs) is shown here to give the first demonstration of high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection with a large anisotropy ratio (&#8776;9) and weak light resolution.







Abstract
We report the self&#8208;assembly of 2D double perovskite (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7 (BLA=benzylammonium) on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 crystals, providing the first demonstration of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection using lead&#8208;free double perovskite heterocrystals (HCs). The (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7/Cs2AgBiBr6 HC successfully combines the anisotropy of 2D double perovskites with the well&#8208;defined interface provided by heterogeneous integration. Driven by the built&#8208;in electric field in junction, photodetectors of HCs exhibit unique polarization dependence of zero&#8208;bias photocurrent with a large anisotropy ratio up to 9, which is 6&#8197;times amplified as compared to the pristine 2D (BLA)2CsAgBiBr7. More importantly, the present devices can remain polarization&#8208;sensitive with incident light intensity down to the nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 level. Our study on lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskite HCs marks a step toward establishing robust material foundations for fundamental scientific investigations and the development of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>The Synthetic Potential of Thiophenium Ylide Cycloadducts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl sulfides were shown to participate in thermal (3+2) cycloadditions with tethered alkynes. The resulting thiophenium ylide cycloadducts led to a variety of polysubstituted thiophenes by trapping with diverse electrophiles.







Abstract
(3+2) cycloaddition reactions are undeniably one of the most robust and versatile synthetic tools in heterocyclic chemistry. The classically required 1,3&#8208;dipoles are however limited to three&#8208;atom sequences bearing stabilized formal charges in their Lewis structure. The scope of three&#8208;atom groupings possible in (3+2) cycloadditions can be greatly expanded by taking of advantage neutral three&#8208;atom components (TACs). These groupings result in zwitterionic (3+2) cycloadducts adaptable to multiple outcomes depending on structure and conditions. Herein, the intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between alkynyl sulfides (neutral TAC) and alkynes to provide key thiophenium ylide intermediates is first reported. These reactive species provide access to highly substituted fused thiophenes following predictable chemical sequences. Structural features on the obtained thiophenes were highly configurable by judicious choice of both alkynyl sulfide substitution and reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemically Tuning Attractive and Repulsive Interactions between Solubilizing Oil Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops is characterized systematically. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221;, or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified and the chemical trends leading to these behaviors are discussed.







Abstract
Micellar solubilization is a transport process occurring in surfactant&#8208;stabilized emulsions that can lead to Marangoni flow and droplet motility. Active droplets exhibit self&#8208;propulsion and pairwise repulsion due to solubilization processes and/or solubilization products raising the droplet's interfacial tension. Here, we report emulsions with the opposite behavior, wherein solubilization decreases the interfacial tension and causes droplets to attract. We characterize the influence of oil chemical structure, nonionic surfactant structure, and surfactant concentration on the interfacial tensions and Marangoni flows of solubilizing oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops. Three regimes corresponding to droplet &#8220;attraction&#8221;, &#8220;repulsion&#8221; or &#8220;inactivity&#8221; are identified. We believe these studies contribute to a fundamental understanding of solubilization processes in emulsions and provide guidance as to how chemical parameters can influence the dynamics and chemotactic interactions between active droplets.

         <title>Functionalizable and Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastics from Chemoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Bio&#8208;renewable Bifunctional &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone</title>

         <dc:description>
The controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP is presented. It can recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (ca. 96&#8201;%). P(MVL)ROP with high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties, which is comparable to isotactic polypropylene (PP) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE).







Abstract
It is a highly attractive strategy to develop chemically recyclable polymers to establish a circular plastic economy. Despite the recent advancements, chemically recyclable polymers still face challenges including high energy cost for polymer preparation or recycling, poor monomer recovery selectivity and efficiency as well as undesired material performance. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization of bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) to produce exclusive functionalizable polyester using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained polyester with high molar mass exhibits good tensile strength comparable to that of some commodity plastics. Remarkably, the obtained polyester can be depolymerized to recover pristine monomer with a 96&#8201;% yield by thermolysis, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>Fe2+/Fe3+ Cycling for Coupling Self&#8208;Powered Hydrogen Evolution and Preparation of Electrode Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling system has been established for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution, in which a Zn&#8722;Fe battery with Fe3+ reduction reaction coupled Zn oxidation powers the electrolyzers of Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR) coupled hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling is used to prepare a multifunctional catalyst by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on siloxene nanosheets.







Abstract
A novel Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery featuring an Fe3+ reduction reaction (Fe3+RR)&#8208;coupled zinc oxidation, and an Fe2+ oxidation reaction (Fe2+OR)&#8208;coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) system as well, was established. This battery is capable of driving two Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER systems in series based on the above Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling, for efficient self&#8208;powered hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, this Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling enables the preparation of a multifunctional catalyst, Pt&#8208;3@SXNS (siloxene nanosheet), by the Fe2+OR&#8208;promoted dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on SXNS; alternatively, this support could be obtained by Fe3+RR&#8208;assisted exfoliation using Fe3+ from the anolyte of Fe2+OR&#8208;coupled HER. The Pt&#8208;3@SXNS catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities toward Fe3+RR in the Zn&#8722;Fe flow battery, HER, and Fe2+OR in the electrolyzer, which is attributed to the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Si. This work offers a new strategy for energy storage and low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from acidic wastewater.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Separation Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage Built from Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), built from macrocycles, were investigated for the first time for the separation of hydrogen isotopes. The MOC crystal has flexible narrow pores, which leads to a separation temperature of over 100&#8197;K even without existing strong adsorption sites.







Abstract
Porous materials that contain ultrafine pore apertures can separate hydrogen isotopes via kinetic quantum sieving (KQS). However, it is challenging to design materials with suitably narrow pores for KQS that also show good adsorption capacities and operate at practical temperatures. Here, we investigate a metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) assembled from organic macrocycles and ZnII ions that exhibits narrow windows (&lt;3.0&#8197;&#197;). Two polymorphs, referred to as 2&#945; and 2&#946;, were observed. Both polymorphs exhibit D2/H2 selectivity in the temperature range 30&#8211;100&#8197;K. At higher temperature (77&#8197;K), the D2 adsorption capacity of 2&#946; increases to about 2.7&#8197;times that of 2&#945;, along with a reasonable D2/H2 selectivity. Gas sorption analysis and thermal desorption spectroscopy suggest a gate&#8208;opening effect of the MOCs pore aperture. This promotes KQS at temperatures above liquid nitrogen temperature, indicating that MOCs hold promise for hydrogen isotope separation in real industrial environments.

         <title>Relaxation of the Plant Cell Wall Barrier via Zwitterionic Liquid Pretreatment for Micelle&#8208;Complex&#8208;Mediated DNA Delivery to Specific Plant Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery is presented. This strategy leverages the synergistic effects of a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid and an organelle&#8208;targeting micelle complex, allowing greatly augmented DNA delivery to target organelles, such as chloroplasts, in living plants.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of genes to specific plant organelles is a key challenge for fundamental plant science, plant bioengineering, and agronomic applications. Nanoscale carriers have attracted interest as a promising tool for organelle&#8208;targeted DNA delivery in plants. However, nanocarrier&#8208;mediated DNA delivery in plants is severely hampered by the barrier of the plant cell wall, resulting in insufficient delivery efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique strategy that synergistically combines a cell wall&#8208;loosening zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) with a peptide&#8208;displaying micelle complex for organelle&#8208;specific DNA delivery in plants. We demonstrated that ZIL pretreatment can enhance cell wall permeability without cytotoxicity, allowing micelle complexes to translocate across the cell wall and carry DNA cargo into specific plant organelles, such as nuclei and chloroplasts, with significantly augmented efficiency. Our work offers a novel concept to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for nanocarrier&#8208;mediated cargo delivery to specific organelles in living plants.

     alt="Relaxation of the Plant Cell Wall Barrier via Zwitterionic Liquid Pretreatment for Micelle-Complex-Mediated DNA Delivery to Specific Plant Organelles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique strategy to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for organelle-specific DNA delivery is presented. This strategy leverages the synergistic effects of a cell wall-loosening zwitterionic liquid and an organelle-targeting micelle complex, allowing greatly augmented DNA delivery to target organelles, such as chloroplasts, in living plants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted delivery of genes to specific plant organelles is a key challenge for fundamental plant science, plant bioengineering, and agronomic applications. Nanoscale carriers have attracted interest as a promising tool for organelle-targeted DNA delivery in plants. However, nanocarrier-mediated DNA delivery in plants is severely hampered by the barrier of the plant cell wall, resulting in insufficient delivery efficiency. Herein, we propose a unique strategy that synergistically combines a cell wall-loosening zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) with a peptide-displaying micelle complex for organelle-specific DNA delivery in plants. We demonstrated that ZIL pretreatment can enhance cell wall permeability without cytotoxicity, allowing micelle complexes to translocate across the cell wall and carry DNA cargo into specific plant organelles, such as nuclei and chloroplasts, with significantly augmented efficiency. Our work offers a novel concept to overcome the plant cell wall barrier for nanocarrier-mediated cargo delivery to specific organelles in living plants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cobalamin&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzes the Unique C&#945;&#8208;Methylation of Glutamine in Methyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;M Reductase</title>

         <dc:description>
The enzyme responsible for the unique C&#945;&#8208;methylation of a glutamine residue within methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase was identified. Biochemical, spectroscopic and mass spectrometric characterization clearly classify the newly identified glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase as a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme and, thus, as a new member of the class B radical SAM methyltransferase family.







Abstract
Methyl&#8208;coenzyme M reductase, which is responsible for the production of the greenhouse gas methane during biological methane formation, carries several unique posttranslational amino acid modifications, including a 2&#8208;(S)&#8208;methylglutamine. The enzyme responsible for the C&#945;&#8208;methylation of this glutamine is not known. Herein, we identify and characterize a cobalamin&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme as the glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase. The recombinant protein from Methanoculleus thermophilus binds cobalamin in a base&#8208;off, His&#8208;off conformation and contains a single [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster. The cobalamin cofactor cycles between the methyl&#8208;cob(III)alamin, cob(II)alamin and cob(I)alamin states during catalysis and produces methylated substrate, 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine and S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio. The newly identified glutamine C&#8208;methyltransferase belongs to the class B radical SAM methyltransferases known to catalyze challenging methylation reactions of sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Double Remote C(sp2)&#8722;H / C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations by Radical Relay</title>

         <dc:description>
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via radical relay have been accomplished by mild visible&#8208;light photocatalysis without an exogenous photocatalyst, featuring meta&#8208;arene and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) functionalizations with a single catalyst.







Abstract
Distal C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations have recently emerged as step&#8208;economical tools for molecular synthesis. However, while the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) construction is of fundamental importance, its formation through double remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has proven elusive. By merging the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization with an aliphatic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, we, herein, describe the catalyzed twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations via photo&#8208;induced ruthenium&#8208;mediated radical relay. Thus, meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H arene bonds and remote C(sp3)&#8722;H alkane bonds were activated by a single catalyst in a single operation. This process was accomplished at room temperature by visible light&#8212;notably without exogenous photocatalysts. Experimental and computational theory studies uncovered a manifold comprising ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H activation, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET), 1,n&#8208;HAT (n=5&#8211;7) and &#963;&#8208;activation by means of a single ruthenium(II) catalyst.

         <title>Sodium Borates: Expanding the Electrolyte Selection for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising technology for grid&#8208;level storage, but require electrolytes specifically optimized for them. This work showcases the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts that can act as electrolytes for SIBs. Electrochemical studies reveal Na[B(hfip)4]&#8901;DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) are excellent alternatives to conventionally used NaPF6.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising grid&#8208;level storage technology due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. The development of new electrolytes for SIBs is imperative since it impacts battery life and capacity. Currently, sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) is used as the benchmark salt, but is highly hygroscopic and generates toxic HF. This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]&#8901;DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]&#8722; anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.

         <title>Trap Inlaid Cationic Hybrid Composite Material for Efficient Segregation of Toxic Chemicals from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid composite aerogel material has been systematically fabricated by encapsulating an active nanosized cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron in a stable hierarchical porous metal&#8211;organic gel matrix. The hybrid aerogel demonstrated efficient and highly selective extraction of metal&#8208;based toxic oxoanions in both batch and dynamic column exchange experiments from simulated industrial wastewater and natural ground water systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based oxoanions are potentially toxic pollutants that can cause serious water pollution. Therefore, the segregation of such species has recently received significant research attention. Even though several adsorbents have been employed for effective management of chemicals, their limited microporous nature along with non&#8208;monolithic applicability has thwarted their large&#8208;scale real&#8208;time application. Herein, we developed a unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material (IPcomp&#8208;6), integrating a stable cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron with a hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic gel. The composite scavenger demonstrated a highly selective and very fast segregation efficiency for various hazardous oxoanions such as, HAsO42&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, ReO4&#8722;, CrO42&#8722;, MnO4&#8722;, in water, in the presence of 100&#8208;fold excess of other coexisting anions. The material was able to selectively eliminate trace HAsO42&#8722; even at low concentration to well below the AsV limit in drinking water defined by WHO.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-based oxoanions are potentially toxic pollutants that can cause serious water pollution. Therefore, the segregation of such species has recently received significant research attention. Even though several adsorbents have been employed for effective management of chemicals, their limited microporous nature along with non-monolithic applicability has thwarted their large-scale real-time application. Herein, we developed a unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material (IPcomp-6), integrating a stable cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron with a hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic gel. The composite scavenger demonstrated a highly selective and very fast segregation efficiency for various hazardous oxoanions such as, HAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, in water, in the presence of 100-fold excess of other coexisting anions. The material was able to selectively eliminate trace HAsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; even at low concentration to well below the As&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; limit in drinking water defined by WHO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Reveals the Evasive Hepatitis&#8197;B Virus Capsid C&#8208;Terminal Domain

The combination of proton&#8208;detected fast MAS NMR &gt;100&#8197;kHz and specific labelling schemes reveals the formerly invisible domain of the Hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid. Since the evasiveness of this domain lies in its dynamic behavior, it is expected that this methodology will be of use to characterize flexible domains in a wider range of proteins.







Abstract
Experimentally determined protein structures often feature missing domains. One example is the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of the hepatitis&#8197;B virus capsid protein, a functionally central part of this assembly, crucial in regulating nucleic&#8208;acid interactions, cellular trafficking, nuclear import, particle assembly and maturation. However, its structure remained elusive to all current techniques, including NMR. Here we show that the recently developed proton&#8208;detected fast magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning solid&#8208;state NMR at &gt;100&#8197;kHz MAS allows one to detect this domain and unveil its structural and dynamic behavior. We describe the experimental framework used and compare the domain's behavior in different capsid states. The developed approaches extend solid&#8208;state NMR observations to residues characterized by large&#8208;amplitude motion on the microsecond timescale, and shall allow one to shed light on other flexible protein domains still lacking their structural and dynamic characterization.

         <title>Alternative Benzoxazole Assembly Discovered in Anaerobic Bacteria Provides Access to Privileged Heterocyclic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biosynthetic route to a medically relevant benzoxazole scaffold was discovered in anaerobic bacteria. Genome editing, heterologous expression, and biotransformation studies show that the pathway invokes specialized precursors, backbone assembly, and heterocyclization to form closoxazoles. The biocatalysts involved display synthetic utility, and prompted the genomics&#8208;driven identification of cryptic gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.







Abstract
Benzoxazole scaffolds feature prominently in diverse synthetic and natural product&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals. Our understanding of their bacterial biosynthesis is, however, limited to ortho&#8208;substituted heterocycles from actinomycetes. We report an overlooked biosynthetic pathway in anaerobic bacteria (typified in Clostridium cavendishii) that expands the benzoxazole chemical space to meta&#8208;substituted heterocycles and heralds a distribution beyond Actinobacteria. The first benzoxazoles from the anaerobic realm (closoxazole A and B) were elucidated by NMR and chemical synthesis. By genome editing in the native producer, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and systematic pathway dissection we show that closoxazole biosynthesis invokes an unprecedented precursor usage (3&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate) and manner of assembly. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by the precursor&#8208;directed biosynthesis of a tafamidis analogue. A bioinformatic survey reveals the pervasiveness of related gene clusters in diverse bacterial phyla.

         <title>Amplification&#8208;Free Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Using CRISPR Cas13a and Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET biosensors are reported for target amplification&#8208;free and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and respiratory syncytial virus. The sensor harnesses the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and the high sensitivity of graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). The sensor performance was validated using synthetic targets, heat&#8208;inactivated virus samples, and clinical samples, showing a sensitivity comparable to that of RT&#8208;qPCR.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) systems have recently received notable attention for their applications in nucleic acid detection. Despite many attempts, the majority of current CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors in infectious respiratory disease diagnostic applications still require target preamplifications. This study reports a new biosensor for amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid detection via harnessing the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and ultrasensitive graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET achieves the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome down to 1 attomolar without target preamplifications. Additionally, we validate the detection performance using clinical SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 samples, including those with low viral loads (Ct value &gt;30). Overall, these findings establish our CRISPR Cas13a&#8208;gFET among the most sensitive amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid diagnostic platforms to date.

         <title>Intrinsic Nonflammable Ether Electrolytes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Chlorine Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte of LiFSI/1.6Cl&#8208;DEE/3TTE with chlorinated&#8208;DEE as the base solvent has excellent flame&#8208;retarding properties, intrinsic anti&#8208;oxidation capabilities and forms interphases rich in LiF and LiCl, which improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages.







Abstract
The issues of inherent low anodic stability and high flammability hinder the deployment of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes in practical high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. Here, we report a rationally designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte with chlorine functionality on ether molecular structure to address these critical challenges. The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates a high Li Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% and a high capacity retention &gt;88&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes at an ultrahigh cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (stable even up to 4.7&#8197;V). The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte not only greatly improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages with interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, but possesses the intrinsic nonflammable safety feature owing to the flame&#8208;retarding ability of chlorine functional groups. This study offers a new approach to enable ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high energy density, long&#8208;life and safe Li metal batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite was codoped with Sb3+ (s&#8208;electron) and Er3+ (f&#8208;electrons). Sb3+ provides sub&#8208;band gap (s to p) optical excitation, which de&#8208;excites via both emitting intense blue light and non&#8208;radiatively exciting f&#8208;electrons of Er3+. Then Er3+ emits 1540&#8197;nm short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) radiation. Phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) show stable performance under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Cs2NaInCl6 double perovskite is stable, environmentally benign and easy to prepare. But it has a wide band gap (5.1&#8197;eV), and therefore, does not show optical and optoelectronic properties in the visible and short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region. Here we introduce such functionalities in Cs2NaInCl6 by codoping Sb3+ (s&#8208;electron doping) and Er3+ (f&#8208;electron doping) ions. Sb3+ doping introduces optically allowed 5s2
5s15p1 electronic absorption at the sub&#8208;band gap level, which then emits blue photoluminescence with &#8776;93&#8201;% quantum yield. But f&#8208;f electronic absorption of Er3+ is parity forbidden. Codoping Sb3+&#8211;Er3+, leads to transfer of excitation energy from Sb3+ to Er3+, yielding SWIR emission at 1540&#8197;nm. Temperature (6 to 300&#8197;K) dependent photoluminescence measurements elucidate the excitation and emission mechanism. A phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) fabricated by using the codoped sample emits stable blue and SWIR radiation over prolonged (84&#8197;hours) operation at 5.1&#8197;V.

Nucleic acid detection plays a critical role in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. In their Research Article (e202203826), Xue Gao, Yi Zhang and co&#8208;workers developed a new biosensor for amplification&#8208;free nucleic acid detection via harnessing the trans&#8208;cleavage mechanism of Cas13a and ultrasensitive graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (gFETs). The illustration shows the Cas13a&#8208;mediated RNA trans&#8208;cleavage on a gFET surface for sensor signal transduction.

A unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material was fabricated by Sujit&#8197;K. Ghosh and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202203385) by strategically implanting a stable cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron in a hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic gel material. The composite scavenger efficiently and selectively sequestrates various metal&#8208;based toxic oxoanions from natural and simulated industrial wastewater samples in both batch and dynamic column exchange sorption experiments.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Temperature Molten Oxide Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high temperature electrochemistry (UTE) is a promising and revolutionary technology for the low&#8208;carbon extraction of metals and in situ production of oxygen on the Moon. The progress of UTE, starting from the physicochemical properties of molten oxides and the development of inert anodes for oxygen evolution reaction and liquid metal cathodes for clean metal extraction, is reviewed. Further challenges and perspectives are highlighted to promote the advancement of UTE.







Abstract
Recently, the ultra&#8208;high temperature electrochemistry (UTE, about &gt;1000&#8201;&#176;C) has emerged, which represents an exploration to extend the temperature limit of human technology in electrochemical engineering. UTE has far&#8208;reaching impact on revolutionary low&#8208;carbon metal extraction and the in situ production of oxygen for deep&#8208;space exploration. It is hence of urgency to systematically summarize the development of UTE. In this Review, the basic concepts of UTE and the physicochemical properties of molten oxides are analyzed. The principles in the design of inert anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction in molten oxides are discussed, which forms a solid basis for the in situ production of oxygen from simulated lunar regolith by UTE. Furthermore, liquid metal cathodes for revolutionary titanium extraction and ironmaking/steelmaking are highlighted. With emphasis on the key challenges and perspectives, the Review can provide valuable inspiration for the rapid advancement of UTE.

         <title>Microplastics and their Additives in the Indoor Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of synthetic polymers are usually present in domestic and public indoor environments. These represent potential sources of microplastics, their monomers, and additives. Depending on the physical properties, fibers, fragments, and organic compounds originating from plastics are found in the air or accumulate in house dust. The question therefore arises as to how humans are exposed to microplastics and their components in indoor spaces.







Abstract
Analyses of air and house dust have shown that pollution of the indoor environment with microplastics could pose a fundamental hygienic problem. Indoor microplastics can result from abrasion, microplastic beads are frequently added to household products and microplastic granules can be found in artificial turf for sports activities and in synthetic admixtures in equestrian hall litter. In this context, the question arose as to what extent particulate emissions of thermoplastic materials from 3D printing should be at least partially classified as microplastics or nanoplastics. The discussion about textiles as a possible source of indoor microplastics has also been intensified. This Minireview gives an overview of the current exposure of residents to microplastics. Trends can be identified from the results and preventive measures can be derived if necessary. It is recommended that microplastics and their additives be given greater consideration in indoor environmental surveys in the future.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Selective Molecular Imaging via Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Controlled, DNA&#8208;Based Biosensor Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging based on engineered light&#8208;activatable DNA biosensors and its further combination with upconversion nanotechnology. Particular attention is paid to the application of this strategy for spatiotemporally controlled subcellular imaging, signal amplification, and regulation of the targeting activity of functional DNA.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based biosensor technologies have shown great potential in chemical and biological detection. These biosensors have been actively developed as probes for molecular imaging in live cells and in animals, allowing in situ detection of analytes in complex biological systems, elucidation of the roles of key molecules in biological processes, and the development of non&#8208;invasive diagnosis and image&#8208;guided surgery. Despite the progress made, improving the spatial&#8208;temporal precision remains a challenge in this field. In this Minireview, we describe the concepts behind spatiotemporally selective molecular imaging via the combination of engineered, light&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based biosensors and upconversion nanotechnology. We then highlight the application of the approach for the spatiotemporally controlled imaging of various targets in specific intracellular organelles, signal amplification, as well as the regulation of targeting activity to receptor proteins. We finally discuss the challenges and perspectives for possible future developments in this emerging field.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Dynamic RGB (Red&#8208;Green&#8208;Blue) Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence in an Anti&#8208;Kasha Organic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic ultra&#8208;long persistence luminescent material with dynamic RGB&#8208;tunable and high&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) based on a triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative was designed and prepared for information encryption and decryption.







Abstract
Organic LPL (long&#8208;persistent luminescence) materials have sparked extensive research interest due to the ultralong&#8208;lived triplet states. Although numerous organic LPL materials have been reported, most of the triplet emission was static and monotonous. Therefore, LPL materials with dynamic triplet emission are urgently required. A triamino&#8208;s&#8208;triazine derivative 1 with dynamic LPL was fabricated. The single&#8208;crystal structure shows that the abundant intermolecular interactions and small free volume restrict the molecular motion and avoid the quenchers. Spectral and theoretical calculations upheld the existence of multiple excited states in 1, and the migration of electrons between multiple excited states is very sensitive to external stimuli. By modulating the stimulus, the residence of electrons in different triplet states can be manipulated to achieve RGB LPL. Importantly, blue LPL was achieved by manipulating the anti&#8208;Kasha emission. And the red LPL can still be observed at high temperature.

     alt="High-Temperature and Dynamic RGB (Red-Green-Blue) Long-Persistent Luminescence in an Anti-Kasha Organic Compound"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel organic ultra-long persistence luminescent material with dynamic RGB-tunable and high-temperature long-persistent luminescence (LPL) based on a triamino-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-triazine derivative was designed and prepared for information encryption and decryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic LPL (long-persistent luminescence) materials have sparked extensive research interest due to the ultralong-lived triplet states. Although numerous organic LPL materials have been reported, most of the triplet emission was static and monotonous. Therefore, LPL materials with dynamic triplet emission are urgently required. A triamino-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-triazine derivative &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with dynamic LPL was fabricated. The single-crystal structure shows that the abundant intermolecular interactions and small free volume restrict the molecular motion and avoid the quenchers. Spectral and theoretical calculations upheld the existence of multiple excited states in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, and the migration of electrons between multiple excited states is very sensitive to external stimuli. By modulating the stimulus, the residence of electrons in different triplet states can be manipulated to achieve RGB LPL. Importantly, blue LPL was achieved by manipulating the anti-Kasha emission. And the red LPL can still be observed at high temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Ammonia Activation Through Coordination&#8208;Induced Bond Weakening in Molybdenum Complexes of a Dianionic Pentadentate Ligand Platform
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum complexes of the dianionic pentadentate ligand B2Pz4Py enable spontaneous activation of coordinated ammonia to release dihydrogen and form a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;nitrido Mo complex. DFT calculations and experimental investigations show that this ligand is highly effective at inducing N&#8722;H bond weakening and the ensuing chemistry brings to light potential side reactions in catalytic ammonia oxidation.







Abstract
Ammonia oxidation catalyzed by molecular compounds is of current interest as a carbon&#8208;free source of dihydrogen. Activation of N&#8722;H bonds through coordination to transition metal centers is a key reaction in this process. We report the substantial activation of ammonia via reaction with low&#8208;valent molybdenum complexes of a diborate pentadentate ligand system. Spontaneous loss of dihydrogen from (B2Pz4Py)MoII&#8722;NH3 at room temperature to produce the dinuclear &#956;&#8208;nitrido compound (B2Pz4Py)Mo&#8208;N&#8208;Mo(B2Pz4Py) is observed due to substantial N&#8722;H bond weakening upon coordination to Mo. Mechanistic details are supported through the experimental observation/characterization of terminal amido, imido and nitrido complexes and density functional theory computations. The generally under&#8208;appreciated role of bridging nitrido intermediates is revealed and discussed, providing guidance for further catalyst development for this process.

         <title>Photoredox Generation of Isothiouronyl Radical Cations: A New Platform in Covalent Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothiouronyl radical cations have been identified as a new class of radical catalysts for the covalent activation of vinylcyclopropanes. Their generation by photoredox catalysis from N,N,N,N&#8208;tetrasubstituted thioureas provides a modular, versatile and practical platform to achieve covalent radical catalysis.







Abstract
Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation of alkenes. However, important limitations in terms of structural diversity and handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur&#8208;centered radicals to achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system were finally evaluated in a (3+2)&#8208;radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and olefins.

         <title>A Lattice&#8208;Matching Strategy for Highly Reversible Copper&#8208;Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. Benefiting from the high lattice matching between Cu anodes and Ni substrates, Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes exhibit superior deposition/striping reversibility, lower nucleation overpotential and uniform deposition on the Ni substrates in comparison with other typical substrates.







Abstract
Copper metal is an attractive anode material for aqueous rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity (844&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good environmental compatibility and high earth abundance. However, the Cu anodes often suffer from poor deposition/stripping reversibility and nonuniform deposition during the charge/discharge process, degrading the lifetime of aqueous Cu&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a lattice&#8208;matching strategy was developed to design high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;metal anodes. In such a strategy, Ni substrates that exhibit high lattice matching with Cu were selected to support the Cu anodes. The high lattice matching endows Cu anodes with high deposition/stripping reversibility, low nucleation overpotential as well as a uniform and dense electrodeposition on Ni substrates. Based on the Ni substrate&#8208;supported Cu anodes, the full cells paired with lead dioxide cathodes show a stable cycling behavior. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu electrodes in aqueous rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Small Molecule Inhibitors of Interferon&#8208;Induced JAK&#8208;STAT Signalling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule that inhibits IFN&#8208;induced JAK&#8208;STAT signalling is reported. Chemical synthesis led to a series of more effective analogues that can selectively inhibit either IFN&#8208;signalling or formin&#8208;mediated actin assembly.







Abstract
Interferons (IFN) are cytokines which, upon binding to cell surface receptors, trigger a series of downstream biochemical events including Janus Kinase (JAK) activation, phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription protein (STAT), translocation of pSTAT to the nucleus and transcriptional activation. Dysregulated IFN signalling has been linked to cancer progression and auto&#8208;immune diseases. Here, we report the serendipitous discovery of a small molecule that blocks IFN&#947; activation of JAK&#8208;STAT signalling. Further lead optimisation gave rise to a potent and more selective analogue that exerts its activity by a mechanism consistent with direct IFN&#947; targeting in vitro, which reduces bleeding in model of haemorrhagic colitis in vivo. This first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule also inhibits type I and III IFN&#8208;induced STAT phosphorylation in vitro. Our work provides the basis for the development of pan&#8208;IFN inhibitory drugs.

         <title>1,5&#8208;Allyl Shift by a Sequential Achmatowicz/Oxonia&#8208;Cope/Retro&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected 1,5&#8208;allyl shift is discovered for allyl furfuryl alcohol through two&#8208;step sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement at room temperature, which could be considered as a Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann&#8208;forbidden formal [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. Mechanistically, it involves Achmatowicz rearrangement, oxonia&#8208;Cope rearrangement, and an unprecedented &#8220;retro&#8208;Achmatowicz&#8221; rearrangement.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Allyl and 1,2&#8208;allyl shifts through [3,3]&#8208; and [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements are well&#8208;established and widely used in organic synthesis. In contrast, 1,5&#8208;allyl shift through related [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is unknown because [3,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is thermally Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann forbidden.

&lt;p&gt;An unexpected 1,5-allyl shift is discovered for allyl furfuryl alcohol through two-step sequential ring expansion/contraction rearrangement at room temperature, which could be considered as a Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann-forbidden formal [3,5]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Mechanistically, it involves Achmatowicz rearrangement, oxonia-Cope rearrangement, and an unprecedented &#8220;retro-Achmatowicz&#8221; rearrangement.

         <title>Mapping Active Site Geometry to Activity in Immobilized Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic performance of frustrated Lewis pairs is attainable through judicious control of the spatial arrangement of the acid and base components. This is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation by mapping the active site geometry to catalyst activity and identifying the optimal distance and orientation of the donor&#8211;acceptor centers using nonlinear scaling relationships.







Abstract
The immobilization of molecular catalysts imposes spatial constraints on their active site. We reveal that in bifunctional catalysis such constraints can also be utilized as an appealing handle to boost intrinsic activity through judicious control of the active site geometry. To demonstrate this, we develop a pragmatic approach, based on nonlinear scaling relationships, to map the spatial arrangements of the acid&#8211;base components of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to their performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The resulting activity map shows that fixing the donor&#8211;acceptor centers at specific distances and locking them into appropriate orientations leads to an unforeseen many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of FLPs compared to their unconstrained counterparts.

         <title>Bioinspired Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emeriones, three highly oxidized and densely functionalized polyketides, were synthesized from two enantioenriched fragments in a Stille&#8208;8&#960;/6&#960; sequence, followed by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and chemoselective oxidations. This work enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C.







Abstract
We report asymmetric bioinspired total syntheses of the fungal metabolites emeriones&#8197;A&#8211;C via stereoselective oxidations of two bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene diastereomers. The central bicyclic scaffolds are prepared in an 8&#960;/6&#960; electrocyclization cascade of a stereodefined pentaene, which contains the fully assembled side chains of the emeriones. The anti&#8208;aldol side chain is made using a Paterson&#8208;aldol addition, and the epoxide of the dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane side chain via ring&#8208;closure onto an oxidized acetal. Our work has enabled the structural revision of emerione&#8197;C, and resulted in the synthesis of a &#8220;missing&#8221; family member, which we call emerione&#8197;D. DFT calculations identified two methyl groups that govern torquoselectivity in the 8&#960;/6&#960; cascade.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroxylation of Dihydrosilanes to Si&#8208;Chiral Silanols Catalyzed by In Situ Generated Copper(II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;mediated &#963;&#8208;metathesis with prochiral dihydrosilanes has been successfully leveraged to efficiently synthesize Si&#8208;chiral silanols as well as many other related Si&#8208;chiral skeletons. The reaction hinges on the continuous generation of catalytically active copper(II) species via single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation of copper(I) by alkyl halides and the efficient stereocontrol with multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective hydroxylation of prochiral dihydrosilanes with water is expected to be a highly efficient way to access Si&#8208;chiral silanols, yet has remained unknown up to date. Herein, we describe a strategy for realizing this reaction: using an alkyl bromide as a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidant for invoking CuII species and chiral multidentate anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for effective enantiocontrol. The reaction readily provides a broad range of Si&#8208;chiral silanols with high enantioselectivity and excellent functional group compatibility. In addition, we manifest the synthetic potential by establishing two synthetic schemes for transforming the obtained products into Si&#8208;chiral compounds with high structural diversity. Our preliminary mechanistic studies support a mechanism involving SET for recruiting chiral CuII species as the active catalyst and its subsequent &#963;&#8208;metathesis with dihydrosilanes.

         <title>Bioinspired and Ligand&#8208;Regulated Unnatural Prenylation and Geranylation of Oxindoles with Isoprene under Pd Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy has been developed for the bioinspired and ligand&#8208;regulated chemoselective unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles with isoprene under Pd catalysis. The selectivity was governed by modulating the coordination geometry of the Pd catalyst.







Abstract
In nature, prenylation and geranylation are two important metabolic processes for the creation of hemiterpenoids and monoterpenoids under enzyme catalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated bioinspired unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles using the basic industrial feedstock isoprene through ligand regulation under Pd catalysis. Pentenylated oxindoles (with C5 added) were attained with high selectivity when using a bisphosphine ligand, whereas upon switching to a monophosphine ligand, selectivity toward geranylated oxindoles (with C10 added) was achieved. Moreover, the head&#8208;to&#8208;head product could be further isomerized to an internal skipped diene under Pd&#8722;H catalysis. No stoichiometric by&#8208;product was formed in the process.

Eu2P2S6 exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2. Eu2P2S6 is the first NLO&#8208;active rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based chalcogenophosphate.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenophosphates are receiving increasing interest, specifically as promising infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) candidates. Here, a rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphate Eu2P2S6 crystallizing in the monoclinic noncentrosymmetric space group Pn was synthesized using a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure features isolated [P2S6]4&#8722; dimer, and two types of EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. Eu2P2S6 exhibits a phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response &#8776;0.9&#215;AgGaS2@2.1&#8197;&#956;m, and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 3.4&#215;AgGaS2, representing the first rare&#8208;earth NLO chalcogenophosphate. The theoretical calculation result suggests that the SHG response is ascribed to the synergetic contribution of [P2S6]4&#8722; dimers and EuS8 bicapped triangular prisms. This work provides not only a promising high&#8208;performance infrared NLO material, but also opens the avenue for exploring rare&#8208;earth chalcogenophosphates as potential IR NLO materials.

         <title>Borylation Directed Borylation of Indoles Using Pyrazabole Electrophiles: A One&#8208;Pot Route to C7&#8208;Borylated&#8208;Indolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophiles based on pyrazabole are simple to access reagents for the double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) borylation of N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles/indolines. Due to the robust B2N4 core of pyrazaboles and a B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation of ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, the first borylation directs the second to a proximal C&#8722;H. For N&#8722;H&#8208;indoles, C7&#8208;borylation occurs alongside reduction resulting, post work&#8208;up, in the one&#8208;pot formation of C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines without requiring installation of a directing group.







Abstract
Pyrazabole (1) is a readily accessible diboron compound that can be transformed into ditopic electrophiles. In 1 (and derivatives), the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation is ca. 3&#8197;&#197;, appropriate for one boron centre bonding to N and one to the C7 of indoles and indolines. This suitable B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B separation enables double E&#8722;H (E=N/C) functionalisation of indoles and indolines. Specifically, the activation of 1 with HNTf2 generates an electrophile that transforms N&#8722;H indoles and indolines into N/C7&#8208;diborylated indolines, with N&#8722;H borylation directing subsequent C7&#8722;H borylation. Indole reduction to indoline occurs before C&#8722;H borylation and our studies indicate this proceeds via hydroboration&#8212;C3&#8208;protodeboronation to produce an intermediate that then undergoes C7 borylation. The borylated products can be converted in situ into C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;N&#8208;H&#8208;indolines. Overall, this represents a transient directed C&#8722;H borylation to form useful C7&#8208;BPin&#8208;indolines.

         <title>Intramolecular C&#8722;H Activation as an Easy Toolbox to Synthesize Pyridine&#8208;Fused Bipolar Hosts for Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reactions have been developed to rapidly build a library of structurally and functionally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons. This new synthetic strategy allowed to explore and highlight the high performance of bipolar host materials for blue OLEDs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenging task. While exploiting new blue emitters has attracted great interest, developing host materials that considerably determine device performance obviously lags behind. Herein, we present an ease of access to the structurally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons by the iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reaction, which unlocks an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly assemble a library of pyridine&#8208;fused bipolar host materials. As an illustrated example, the benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine skeleton (BTP) has been made to a pseudo&#8208;symmetric host (DCz&#8208;BTP). The merging of a pyridine fragment enables strong intermolecular interactions, leading to satisfactory bipolar transporting properties. Utilizing DCz&#8208;BTP as the host, blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs (TADF&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8&#8197;V and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 29.0&#8201;% and blue TADF&#8208;sensitized florescent OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) give an EQEmax as high as 20.5&#8201;%, revealing the potential of the BTP skeleton for the construction of high&#8208;performance host materials.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol at Close to Theoretical Potential via Engineering Abundant Electron&#8208;Donating Cu&#948;+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>

Cu2S1&#8722;x hollow nanocubes with abundant and stable Cu&#948;+ species are synthesized and achieve ethanol&#8208;selective electrosynthesis. The abundant Cu&#948;+ sites have electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to liquid multi&#8208;carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu&#948;+ is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu0. Here a Cu2S1&#8722;x catalyst with abundant Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9&#8201;% and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3&#8201;% but also provides a long&#8208;term stability of Cu&#948;+, gaining an economic profit based on techno&#8208;economic analysis. The calculation and in situ spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu&#948;+ sites display electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.

         <title>Evolution and Single&#8208;Droplet Analysis of Fuel&#8208;Driven Compartments by Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics were used to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. The nucleation, growth, and dissolution of active coacervate&#8208;based droplets were investigated with this setup.







Abstract
Active droplets are a great model for membraneless organelles. However, the analysis of these systems remains challenging and is often limited due to the short timescales of their kinetics. We used droplet&#8208;based microfluidics to encapsulate a fuel&#8208;driven cycle that drives phase separation into coacervate&#8208;based droplets to overcome this challenge. This approach enables the analysis of every coacervate&#8208;based droplet in the reaction container throughout its lifetime. We discovered that the fuel concentration dictates the formation of the coacervate&#8208;based droplets and their properties. We observed that coacervate&#8208;based droplets grow through fusion, decay simultaneously independent of their volume, and shrinkage rate scales with their initial volume. This method helps to further understand the regulation of membraneless organelles, and we believe the analysis of individual coacervate&#8208;based droplets enables future selection&#8208; or evolution&#8208;based studies.

         <title>Synthesis and Visualization of Entangled 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Valency Stereoscopic Molecular Nodes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic molecular node is used to synthesize two isoreticular 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy unravels their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating networks with a bcu topology. The unique pore architectures and strong binding sites enable excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The high&#8208;valency molecular node may lead to new 3D COF topologies.







Abstract
The structural diversity of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are limited as there are only a few choices of building units with multiple symmetrically distributed connection sites. To date, 4 and 6&#8208;connected stereoscopic nodes with Td, D3h, D3d and C3 symmetries have been mostly reported, delivering limited 3D topologies. We propose an efficient approach to expand the 3D COF repertoire by introducing a high&#8208;valency quadrangular prism (D4h) stereoscopic node with a connectivity of eight, based on which two isoreticular 3D imine&#8208;linked COFs can be created. Low&#8208;dose electron microscopy allows the direct visualization of their 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated bcu networks. These 3D COFs are endowed with unique pore architectures and strong molecular binding sites, and exhibit excellent performance in separating C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 gas pairs. The introduction of high&#8208;valency stereoscopic nodes would lead to an outburst of new topologies for 3D COFs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Glycosylation and Mechanistic Studies</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation involves an oxidative addition/reductive elimination process, while aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation is mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. DFT calculations showed that steric hindrance is responsible for the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosides are popular basic skeletons in biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed highly stereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation is described. A series of C&#8208;aryl pyranosides and furanosides were synthesized by this method. The strategy showed good substrate scope, and various N&#8208;heterocyclic directing groups were compatible with the reaction system. A mechanistic study suggested that the key pathway of ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation might involve oxidative addition/reduction elimination, whereas aryl meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation was mediated by &#963;&#8208;activation. Density functional theory calculations also showed that the high stereoselectivity of meta&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation was due to steric hindrance.

         <title>Controlling the Valence&#8208;Electron Arrangement of Nickel Active Centers for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers can be controlled precisely by introducing Ni vacancies into electrocatalysts for facilitated hydrogen oxidation. Benefiting from the optimized valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interactions with key intermediates, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N exhibited a 15&#8208;fold enhanced mass activity in comparison with Ni3N which has far fewer Ni vacancies.







Abstract
The valence&#8208;electron arrangement of heterogeneous catalysts can significantly affect the binding behavior of absorbates. However, it remains a challenge to understand the role of the valence&#8208;electron arrangement in electrocatalysis, which limits its utilization as a tool to design efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we describe experiments in which the valence&#8208;electron arrangement of Ni active centers for hydrogen oxidation is controlled precisely by using Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N as a platform. These Ni vacancies can promote the valence&#8208;electron delocalization of OH&#8208;adsorption centers to enhance the Ni&#8201;ds&#8211;O&#8201;2p valence&#8208;electron&#8208;orbital interaction with elevated OH adsorption. Meanwhile, the deficit of valence&#8208;electrons of H&#8208;adsorption centers at Ni vacancies can lower Ni&#8201;ds&#8211;H&#8201;1s interaction with weakened H binding. Relative to Ni3N poor in vacancies, the Ni&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Ni3N showed a mass activity enhanced by 15&#8208;fold. This strategy paves a rational way to design efficient catalysts by finely tuning the valence&#8208;electron arrangement.

         <title>Highly Active Si Sites Enabled by Negative Valent Ru for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in LaRuSi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike other Ru&#8208;containing compounds whose active sites are Ru sites, the Si sites in LaRuSi function as real active sites. The unusual negative valence Ru in this compound has excessively tight adsorption for hydrogen, according to both theoretical calculations and in situ Raman observations, but the Si sites have excellent hydrogen adsorption properties.







Abstract
The discovery and identification of novel active sites are paramount for deepening the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and driving the development of remarkable electrocatalysts. Here, we reveal that the genuine active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in LaRuSi are Si sites, not the usually assumed Ru sites. Ru in LaRuSi has a peculiar negative valence state, which leads to strong hydrogen binding to Ru sites. Surprisingly, the Si sites have a Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption that is near zero (0.063&#8197;eV). The moderate adsorption of hydrogen on Si sites during the HER process is also validated by in situ Raman analysis. Based on it, LaRuSi exhibits an overpotential of 72&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, which is close to the benchmark of Pt/C. This work sheds light on the recognition of real active sites and the exploration of innovative silicide HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Kibdelomycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of kibdelomycin, which leveraged readily available starting materials, enabled the efficient preparation of the potent antimicrobial and its C&#8208;22 epimer in 16 steps (LLS). The modularity of the strategy provided rapid access to 8 analogs, allowing investigation of structural activity relation.







Abstract
A modular total synthesis of kibdelomycin is disclosed that should enable structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies of this interesting class of antibiotics. The route uses simple building blocks and addresses lingering questions about its structural assignment and relationship to amycolamicin, a recently described natural product reported to have a similar structure. Initial antibacterial assays reveal that both C&#8208;22 epimers (the N&#8208;glycosidic linkage) of the natural product have similar activity while structurally truncated analogs lose activity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Stable Iron Pentacarbonyl Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The open&#8208;shell iron pentacarbonyl cation [Fe(CO)5].+ was synthesized and isolated as a stable salt for the first time. The strategy involved the use of a strong deelectronator, i.e., single&#8208;electron oxidant, in combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs). The iron carbonyl complex is a novel example of low&#8208;valent iron and has thus been fully characterized. Isolation was achieved using standard laboratory conditions in combination with fluorinated benzenes as solvents.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell iron pentacarbonyl cation [Fe(CO)5].+ was isolated by deelectronation, i.e., the single&#8208;electron oxidation of the parent neutral Fe(CO)5 using [phenazineF].+ as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salt (RF=C(CF3)3; phenazineF=perfluoro&#8208;5,10&#8208;bis(perfluorophenyl)&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine). [Fe(CO)5].+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; was fully characterized (scXRD analysis, IR, NMR, EPR, 57Fe spectroscopy, CV and SQUID magnetization study) and, apart from being a compound of fundamental interest, may serve as a precursor for low&#8208;valent iron coordination chemistry.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry Engineered Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photoanode with Ultralow Onset Potential for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the film/substrate interface via coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) photoanode featuring intimate contact between the PCN film and the titanium&#8208;coated fluorine&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate was derived. Benefitting from the substantially reduced interfacial resistance credited by the strong coordination interaction, a record ultralow onset potential which enables unbiased water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Construction of an intimate film/substrate interface is of great importance for a photoelectrode to achieve efficient photoelectrochemical performance. Inspired by coordination chemistry, a polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) film is intimately grown on a Ti&#8208;coated substrate by an in situ thermal condensation process. The as&#8208;prepared PCN photoanode exhibits a record low onset potential (Eonset) of &#8722;0.38&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a decent photocurrent density of 242&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE for water splitting. Detailed characterization confirms that the origin of the ultralow onset potential is mainly attributed to the substantially reduced interfacial resistance between the Ti&#8208;coated substrate and the PCN film benefitting from the constructed interfacial sp2 N&#8594;Ti coordination bonds. For the first time, the ultralow onset potential enables the PCN photoanode to drive water splitting without external bias with a stable photocurrent density of &#8776;9&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 up to 1&#8197;hour.

DAC&#8208;carbon: A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. The superhard sp3 carbon framework serves as a microscopic diamond anvil cell, in which the sp2 chains are compressed to establish metallicity and superconductivity.







Abstract
A metallic, covalently bonded carbon allotrope is predicted via first principles calculations. It is composed of an sp3 carbon framework that acts as a diamond anvil cell by constraining the distance between parallel cis&#8208;polyacetylene chains. The distance between these sp2 carbon atoms renders the phase metallic, and yields two well&#8208;nested nearly parallel bands that cross the Fermi level. Calculations show this phase is a conventional superconductor, with the motions of the sp2 carbons being key contributors to the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The sp3 carbon atoms impart superior mechanical properties, with a predicted Vickers hardness of 48&#8197;GPa. This phase, metastable at ambient conditions, could be made by on&#8208;surface polymerization of graphene nanoribbons, followed by pressurization of the resulting 2D sheets. A family of multifunctional materials with tunable superconducting and mechanical properties could be derived from this phase by varying the sp2 versus sp3 carbon content, and by doping.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free N&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phospha&#8208;Wittig Reagents
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 32, August 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile activation of NH3 with the aid of phospha&#8208;Wittig reagents has been demonstrated to give for the first time secondary aminophoshines of the type ArP(H)NH2. Evident from DFT calculations two molecules of NH3 act in concert to facilitate an NH3 for PMe3 exchange and subsequent proton shift. The activation of primary and secondary amines is likewise achieved.







Abstract
N&#8208;containing molecules are mostly derived from ammonia (NH3). Ammonia activation has been demonstrated for single transition metal centers as well as for low&#8208;valent main group species. Phosphinidenes, mono&#8208;valent phosphorus species, can be stabilized by phosphines, giving so&#8208;called phosphanylidenephosphoranes of the type RP(PR&#8242;3). We demonstrate the facile, metal&#8208;free NH3 activation using ArP(PMe3), affording for the first time isolable secondary aminophosphines ArP(H)NH2. DFT studies reveal that two molecules of NH3 act in concert to facilitate an NH3 for PMe3 exchange. Furthermore, H2NR and HNR2 activation is demonstrated.

         <title>An Intelligent Nanomachine Guided by DNAzyme Logic System for Precise Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intelligent nanomachine usually has a control center to carry out self&#8208;regulation. Unfortunately, most of the nanomaterials for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) do not have such a control center to sense and process the chemical or biological signals, which greatly weakens the selectivity and efficiency of CDT. To address this problem, here an intelligent nanomachine was constructed with a DNAzyme logic gate as the control center, and metal organic framework as the actuator. The well&#8208;designed nanomachine showed an enhanced killing effect on cancer cells but posed no harm to normal cells, acquiring better selectivity than clinical chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported cell&#8208;specific CDT by the guidance of DNAzyme logic gate. Our work highlights the great potential of DNAzymes in intelligent response networks, and extends the implementation of nanomachines in precision medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime Photocatalysis for Phosphorylated Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, cobaloxime is disclosed for the first time to achieve phosphorylated heteroaromatics, which is an intriguing and versatile functional motif. With visible&#8208;light irradiation, cobaloxime not only oxidizes phosphine oxide to form phosphorus radical (P&#8208;radical) for subsequent reaction with radical acceptor isocyanides or heteroaromatics, but also combines the radical intermediate with &#946;&#8208;H elimination, thereby producing phosphorylated heteroaromatics with only H2 or CH4 as byproduct. Phosphine oxides with dialkyl, alkylaryl, and diaryl could be directly transformed into phosphorylated phenanthridines, benzothiazoles, isoquinolines and common heteroaromatics. This catalytic system features extremely mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good to excellent yields, in which scale&#8208;up reaction and sunlight reaction have shown great application potential in green synthesis of important organophosphorus chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Radical Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simplified and appealing strategy via a chiral catalyst to facilitate the electrochemical process and provide asymmetric induction of radical reactions is particularly desirable and would have potential applications in electrosynthesis, organic chemistry, and drug discovery. Here, we introduced a novel electrolytic system that diverts the standard ionic reactivity to new catalytic functions, enabling mechanistically distinct single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;based enantioselective routes to exhibit a brand&#8208;new pattern of reactivity&#8212;electricity&#8208;driven asymmetric catalysis as a privileged chiral platform for enantioselective radical allylation. The nickel&#8208;catalyzed activation of nucleophiles triggered a single&#8208;electron transfer process to provide a chiral catalyst&#8208;bound radical cation intermediate, which could be applied as an alternative strategy for the development of stereocontrolled radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Strain Relaxation on 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual strain in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Strain relaxation facilitated by the organic spacer cations leads to improved film quality, suppressed recombination, and enhanced device performance under external stress.







Abstract
Although the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached the commercial standards, the unsatisfactory stability limits their further application. Hydrophobic interface and encapsulation can block the damage of water and oxygen, while the instability induced by intrinsic residual strain remains inevitable. Here, the residual strain in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. It's found that the spacer cations contribute to the residual strain even though they are not in the inorganic cages. Benefited from strain relaxation, the film quality is improved, leading to suppressed recombination, promoted charge transport and enhanced efficiency. More significantly, the strain&#8208;released devices maintain 86&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after being kept in air with 85&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) for 1080&#8197;h, 82&#8201;% under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 804&#8197;h and 86&#8201;% after continuous heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1080&#8197;h.

         <title>Manipulating Reaction Intermediates to Aqueous&#8208;Phase&#160; ZnSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters and Quantum Dots at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is not resolved which model describes better the aqueous&#8208;phase nucleation and growth of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), the classical one&#8208;step one or the nonclassical multi&#8208;step one. Here, we design a room&#8208;temperature reaction to trap reaction intermediates in the prenucleation stage of ZnSe QDs (as a model system). We show that the trapped intermediate can transform to magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) via intra&#8208;molecular reorganization and can fragment to enable the growth of QDs. The MSCs exhibit a sharp optical absorption peaking at 299 nm, labelled MSC&#8208;299. The intermediate, the precursor compound (PC&#8208;299) of MSC&#8208;299, is optically transparent at 299 nm and to longer wavelengths. This intermediate forms in various Zn and Se reaction systems. The present study provides unambiguous evidence that the nonclassical and classical pathways are both necessary to explain the nucleation and growth of aqueous&#8208;phase QDs, with the former pathway favored more by high reaction concentrations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sustainable processes for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes/alkadienes impurities in alkenes feedstocks are in great demand in industry as the utilization of excessive hydrogen, high temperature and unsatisfactory alkenes selectivity of the current thermo&#8208;catalytic route, however, their development is still challenging. Herein, we innovate a light&#8208;assisted semi&#8208;hydrogenation process in gas&#8208;feed fixed bed reactor, with water as hydrogen atom source by in&#8208;situ photocatalysis. Using Pd/TiO  2  as model catalyst, this process shows an excellent catalytic performance for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, with 100% of butenes selectivity at ~99% of conversion over 180 h of reaction at   ambient temperature   driven by 66 mW cm  &#8208;2  of irradiation intensity  . This light&#8208;driven, H  2  &#8208;free,  ambient temperature  semi&#8208;hydrogenation process, with superior performance to that of thermocatalytic route, shows attractive to bring an evolution i  n industrial hydrogenation technology to an economical and safe way  .</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Quinone&#8208;Based Anodes with Rapid Kinetics for Rechargeable Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinone compounds, which are capable of accommodating proton (H  +  ), are emerging electrodes in aqueous batteries. However, the storage mechanism of proton in quinone compounds is less known and the energy/power density of quinone&#8208;based proton battery is still limited. Here we design a series of quinone anodes and study their electrochemical properties in acidic electrolyte, in which tetramethylquinone (TMBQ) delivers a high capacity of 300 mAh g  &#8211;1  with an extremely low polarization of 20 mV at 1 C, and maintains over 50% theoretical capacity in less than 16 seconds. The fast kinetics of TMBQ is attributed to the continuous H  +  migration channel, high H  +  diffusion coefficient (10  &#8211;6  cm  2  s  &#8211;1  ), and low H  +  migration energy barrier (0.26 eV). When coupling with MnO  2  cathode, the battery shows a long lifespan of 4000 cycles with a capacity retention of 77% at 5 C. This study reveals the proton transport in quinone&#8208;electrodes and offers new insights to design advanced aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol over Carbon&#8208;Coated CuOx Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient Cu&#8208;based catalysts is critical for CO2 electroreduction to multiple carbon products. However, most Cu&#8208;based catalysts are favorable for ethylene production while selective production of ethanol with high Faradaic efficiency and current density still remains great challenges. Herein, we design a carbon&#8208;coated CuOx (CuOx@C) catalyst through one&#8208;pot pyrolysis of Cu&#8208;based metal organic framework, which exhibits high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with Faradaic efficiency of 46%. Impressively, the partial current density of ethanol reaches 166 mA cm&#8208;2, which is higher than that of most catalysts in the literatures. Operando Raman spectra indicate that the carbon skin can efficiently stabilize Cu+ species under CO2 electroreduction conditions, which promotes C&#8208;C coupling step. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the carbon layer can tune the key intermediate *HOCHCH goes the hydrogenation pathway toward ethanol production.</dc:description>
