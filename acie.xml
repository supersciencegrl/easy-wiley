         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on a Silicon Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorption of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) on silicon is investigated in a combined scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory study. We find that both of the studied NHOs bind covalently, with ylidic character, to the silicon adatoms of the substrate and exhibit good thermal stability. The adsorption geometry strongly depends on the N&#8208;substituents: for large N&#8208;substituents, an upright adsorption geometry is favored, while a flat&#8208;lying geometry is found for the NHO with smaller wingtips. These different geometries strongly influence the quality and properties of the obtained monolayers. The upright geometry leads to the formation of ordered monolayers, whereas the flat&#8208;lying NHOs yield a mostly disordered, but denser, monolayer. The obtained monolayers both show large work function reductions, as the higher density of the flat&#8208;lying monolayer is found to compensate for the smaller vertical dipole moments. Our findings offer new prospects in the design of tailor&#8208;made ligand structures in organic electronics and optoelectronics, catalysis, and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8211;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlined Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Loop Mimicry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides comprising endocyclic organic fragments, &#8220;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides&#8221;, can be probes for perturbing protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs).&#160; Finding loop mimics is difficult because of high conformational variability amongst targets.&#160; Backbone Matching (BM), introduced here, helps solve this problem in the illustrative cases by facilitating efficient evaluation of virtual cyclo&#8208;organopeptide core&#8208;structure libraries.&#160; Thus, 86 rigid organic fragments were selected to build a library of 602 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides comprising Ala and organic parts: &#8220;cyclo&#8208;{&#8208;(Ala)n&#8208;organo&#8208;}&#8221;. &#160;The central hypothesis is &#8220;hit&#8221; library members have accessible low energy conformers corresponding to backbone structures of target protein loops, while library members which cannot attain this conformation are probably unworthy of further evaluation.&#160; BM thereby prioritizes candidate loop mimics, so that less than 10 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides are needed to be prepared to find leads for two illustrative PPIs: iNOS&#8226;SPSB2, and uPA&#8226;uPAR.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is emerging as one of the important non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques in biomedical research. Small molecule&#8208; second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) PA dyes combined with imaging data can provide comprehensive and in&#8208;depth in vivo physiological and pathological information. However, the NIR&#8208;II PA dyes usually exhibit &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; properties due to the lack of a readily optically tunable group, which hinders the further applications in vivo. Herein, a novel class of dyes GX have been designed and synthesized as the activatable NIR&#8208;II PA platform, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360 nm. Importantly, dyes GX have a strong tissue penetration depth and high&#8208;resolution for the mouse vasculature structures in NIR&#8208;II PA 3D imaging and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) imaging. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II PA probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by carbon monoxide (CO) was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in the hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging. We expect that many derivatives of dyes GX will be developed to afford versatile NIR&#8208;II PA platforms for designing a wide variety activatable NIR&#8208;II PA probes as biomedical tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21 vol% O2 and 10 vol% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8211;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120 &#176;C for 240 h (at 100 ppm SO2 and 10 vol% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8211;O&#8211;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8211;S) bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of an Antiviral Cinnamoylphloroglucinol Collection from Cleistocalyx operculatus: A Synthesis Strategy Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks for the collective and divergent biomimetic syntheses of cleistoperlones A&#8211;F (1&#8211;6), a cinnamoylphloroglucinol collection discovered from Cleistocalyx operculatus, has been developed. These syntheses were proceeded successfully in only six to seven steps starting from the commercially available 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriol involving oxidative activation of stable biogenetic building blocks into activated forms as a crucial step. Key features of the syntheses include a unique Michael addition/ketalization/1,6&#8208;addition/enol&#8208;keto tautomerism cascade reaction for the construction of dihydropyrano[3,2&#8208;d]xanthene tetracyclic core of 1 and 2, and a rare inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition for the establishment of benzopyran ring in 4&#8211;6. Moreover, compound 1 exhibited significant antiviral activity against acyclovir&#8208;resistant strains of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV&#8208;1/Blue and HSV&#8208;1/153).</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2 Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linker engineering of a flexible SiF62&#8722; (SIFSIX) pillared network via single atom substitution profoundly changes the sorption behavior and affords a kinetically stable shape&#8208;memory material. The &#8216;memorized&#8217; open phase efficiently purifies a CO2/N2 (15/85) mixture in a manner which would be infeasible for the nonporous variant.







Abstract
We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network. Specifically, whereas SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;Cu, [Cu(SiF6)(L)2]n, (L=1,4&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene, SiF62&#8722;=SIFSIX) has been previously reported to exhibit reversible switching between closed and open phases, the activated phase of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, [Cu(SiF6)(LN)2]n (LN=2,5&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)pyridine), transformed to a kinetically stable porous phase with strong affinity for CO2. As&#8208;synthesized SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, &#945;, transformed to less open, &#947;, and closed, &#946;, phases during activation. &#946; did not adsorb N2 (77&#8197;K), rather it reverted to &#945; induced by CO2 at 195, 273 and 298&#8197;K. CO2 desorption resulted in &#945;&#8242;, a shape&#8208;memory phase which subsequently exhibited type&#8208;I isotherms for N2 (77&#8197;K) and CO2 as well as strong performance for separation of CO2/N2 (15/85) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar driven by strong binding (Qst=45&#8211;51&#8197;kJ/mol) and excellent CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 700). Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re&#8208;solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN.

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the DHF copolymers with enhanced alternating ratios and degradability. By carefully tuning the ROMP reactivities of comonomers and Ru initiators, we achieved an outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%), while preserving the benefits of living polymerization. The superior degradability of our copolymers was also demonstrated by the notable NMR yield of the unimeric degradation products (up to 80&#8201;%) and recovery ratio (66&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB) Small&#8208;Molecule Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB Activity Profiling in Living Cells
</title>

         <dc:description>
IMP&#8208;2373 is the first activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) that captures the activity of a large portion of the &#8220;DUBome&#8221; across multiple deubiquitinase (DUB) sub&#8208;classes with limited off&#8208;target effects in living cells, providing a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs, which function only in lysates. IMP&#8208;2373 enables researchers to profile DUB inhibitors target engagement and selectivity in cells, and to understand DUB activity in disease&#8208;relevant systems.







Abstract
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates, often leading to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel network design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers, and a series of physical analysis is performed to provide a deep structure&#8208;property understanding for the excellent performance of the defined&#8208;network vitrimers.







Abstract
Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially proximate electron donor&#8208;acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8722;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an environmentally&#8208;friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from CO2 molecules as a precursor. Two&#8208;step reactions using NaBH4, piperazine and melamine with CO2 provided high crystalline structure. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure showing 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of BET surface area and structural integrity. This structure transforms to high proton conductor upon post&#8208;modification reaction with Oxone.







Abstract
Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3&#8201;%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6&#8197;M HCl), base (6&#8197;M NaOH), and boiling water over 24&#8197;hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 95&#8201;% of relative humidity.

         <title>Structures, Bonding Analyses and Reactivity of a Dicationic Digallene and Diindene Mimicking trans&#8208;bent Ditetrylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of group 13 compounds featuring the first cationic, trans&#8208;bent double bonded digallene and diindene with the bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane ligand is reported. Their bonding situations are extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations and compared to that in isoelectronic, neutral digermenes and distannenes. Several oxidative addition reactions to the digallene were studied.







Abstract
The reaction of bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent MI sources [MI(PhF)2][pf] (M=Ga+, In+; [pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}2][pf]2, containing the first dicationic, trans&#8208;bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non&#8208;classical MI&#8646;MI double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene&#8208;like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}2]2+([pf]&#8722;)2 readily reacts with 1&#8208;hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety modulated with S species in higher coordination shells is obtained by a general two&#8208;step strategy. The synergy between the nearest N2O2 coordination and S atoms in the second coordination shell leads to robust Zn sites with optimized electronic structure and nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate. The Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance.







Abstract
Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), particularly the simultaneous engineering of multiple coordination shells, is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n&#8805;2; designated as Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S). Systematic analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96&#8201;%. Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell, it shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.

         <title>Is &#8220;Water in Salt&#8221; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of highly concentrated electrolytes has become a popular approach to stabilize electrodes in aqueous environments, we demonstrated in this paper that diluted electrolytes can also be effectively used. By appropriate selection of chaotropic anions, we show that the performance of PTCDA electrodes can be substantially improved and maintain excellent stability even at extremely diluted solutions.







Abstract
The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes concept to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has spurred extensive research efforts toward development of improved aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Detection of Large&#8208;Scale Reorientations of Transmembrane Helices During Influenza A M2 Channel Opening
</title>

         <dc:description>
Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large&#8208;scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.







Abstract
Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.

         <title>Mixed Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structures and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+&#8226;2[BArylF4]&#8208; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+&#8226;2[BArylF4]&#8208; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8208; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of forbidden transition (&#916;ms = &#177; 2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;&#8208;trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorus:&#160; Thiolate Exchange Cascades with Higher Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce phosphorus, a pnictogen, as an exchange center for dynamic covalent chemistry.&#160; Cascade exchange of neutral phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates with thiolates is demonstrated in organic solvents, aqueous micellar systems, and in living cells.&#160; Exchange rates increase with pH, electrophilicity of the exchange center and nucleophilicity of the exchangers.&#160; Molecular walking of the dynamic phosphorus along Hammett gradients is simulated by the sequential addition of thiolate exchangers.&#160; Compared to phosphorotrithioates, tetrathioates are better electrophiles with higher exchange rates.&#160; Dynamic phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates are non&#8208;toxic to HeLa Kyoto cells and participate in the dynamic networks that account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrate that suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and develop a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silences SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggers strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was functioned with a siRNA, a peptide vaccine, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. In vivo, the nanomedicine concentrated on the TME, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for improving the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reported a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane /ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3 times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01 mol%, and even 15.3 times at an extremely low loading of 0.002 mol%. Via 19F NMR, control experiments, and theoretical calculation, we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity for the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity due to the increase in entropy.</dc:description>

         <title>Green ether electrolytes for sustainable high&#8208;voltage potassium ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon&#8208;chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent's biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2 V high&#8208;voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether&#8208;based electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Chelating Aziridines and Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) from Pyridyl&#8208;Tethered Robust Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh(I) complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine&#8208;based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.







Abstract
Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions. But an offbeat aspect about them is the isomeric nature of aldiminium&#8208;based azomethine ylides and (alkyl/aryl)(amino)carbenes, interconvertible by a formal 1,3&#8208;H+ transfer. Herein, two thermally robust azomethine ylides with a N&#8208;appended picolyl sidearm are isolated, which cyclize to pyaziridines at 80&#8201;&#176;C but unprecedentedly result N&#8722;picoCAAC&#8208;CuCl (CAAC=cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes when heated with CuCl at merely 60&#8201;&#176;C. The pendant Npy, as revealed by computational analysis, plays a crucial role in this unusual 1,3&#8208;H+ shift using a deprotonation&#8208;protonation sequence, as well as in placing the CuCl at the carbenic site in tandem. The softer nature of Cu(I) is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a N&#8208;tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both N&#8208;picoCAAC and pyaziridine are bidentate chelators giving highly active cationic Rh(I) catalysts for hydrosilylating unactivated olefins by Et3SiH. Notably, the pyaziridine&#8208;Rh(I) is superior than the N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;Rh(I) catalyst.

The softer nature of Cu&lt;sup&gt;(I)&lt;/sup&gt; is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both &lt;sup&gt;

Notably, the &lt;sup&gt;py&lt;/sup&gt;aziridine-Rh&lt;sup&gt;(I)&lt;/sup&gt; is superior than the &lt;sup&gt;

         <title>Structure and Function of the &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important polyketide antibiotic bearing a 6&#8208;hydroxy group that is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, authentic synthetic substrates and mass spectrometry were used to establish the mechanistic steps governing incorporation of this key 6&#8208;hydroxy group by an &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule that recruits a trans acting monooxygenase, MupA.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8722;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxy group proposed to be introduced by &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an in vitro approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with in vivo studies leading to the first characterisation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0 shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatiotemporal control of in trans MupA recruitment in the context of the PKS. Finally, the detection of multiple intermodular MupA/ACP interactions suggests these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.

         <title>Stereospecific Aminative Cyclizations Triggered by Intermolecular Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by the pendant nucleophile. The method offers broad scope with respect to the nucleophile (N&#8208;, O&#8208; or C&#8208;based), alkene and cyclization mode, allowing the installation of two contiguous stereocenters under operationally simple conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Subrutilane &#8211; A Hexacyclic Sesterterpene from Streptomyces subrutilus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure including the absolute configuration was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with a blocked reactivity in the C6&#8208;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogs were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8208;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.</dc:description>

We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro-crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non-covalent binding events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stability Investigations on a Pt@HGS Catalyst as a Model Material for Fuel Cell Applications: The Role of the Local pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the resistance of catalysts against electroche&#173;mical degradation is one of the key requirements for the wider use of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Here, we study the degradation of one entity of a highly stable catalyst, Pt@HGS, on a nanoelectrode under accelerated mass transport conditions. We find that the catalyst degrades more rapidly than expected based on previous ensemble measurements. Corroborated by identical location transmission electron microscopy and catalyst layer experiments, we deduce that locally different pH values are likely the reason for this difference in stability. Ultimately, this work provides insights into the actual conditions present in a PEMFC and raises questions about the applicability of accelerated stress tests usually performed to evaluate catalyst stability, particularly when they are performed in half&#8208;cell setups under inert gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enabled Asymmetric Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Chiral Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, 97 mAh g&#8208;1 at 50 A g&#8208;1), attractive energy density (182.1 Wh kg&#8208;1) and power density (31.2 kW kg&#8208;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl Lewisa is an attractive carbohydrate&#8208;associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewisa based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewisa tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti&#8208;sialyl Lewisa IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.







Abstract
Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLea&#8208;based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine&#8208;bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward the sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea&#8208;expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea&#8208;based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace water monitoring in complex mixtures using mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed. A charge labelled electrophile functions as a mass tag to specifically capture water from the mixture. Dynamic monitoring of water content in levitated droplets and in chemical reaction mixtures facilitates mechanistic investigations of processes involving water.







Abstract
This study uses a rapid tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace&#8208;water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8211;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge&#8208;labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass&#8208;measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001&#8201;% (10&#8197;ppm) to 99&#8201;%, with better than 10&#8201;% relative standard deviation, along with short (1&#8197;min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#956;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, for example, deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, for example, organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.

&lt;p&gt;This study uses a rapid tandem mass-spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace-water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8211;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge-labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge-labelled molecule (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass-measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001&#8201;% (10&#8197;ppm) to 99&#8201;%, with better than 10&#8201;% relative standard deviation, along with short (1&#8197;min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#956;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, for example, deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, for example, organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene can be photopolymerized in dispersion using visible light and an optimized photo&#8208;initiating system, overcoming light scattering by the growing objects. Stable latexes with particle diameters up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m were obtained using poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer. This represents a fourfold increase in the largest particle size ever reached by a photochemical process in a dispersed medium.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350&#8197;nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.

         <title>Activity And Stability of Single&#8208; And Di&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the O2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational screening method to identify single&#8208; and di&#8208;atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction with metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces is presented. We have performed a three&#8208;step screening study to explore the structural stability, catalytic activity, and electrochemical stability of the catalysts using first&#8208;principles simulations.







Abstract
Efficient and inexpensive catalysts for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we designed a computational catalyst&#8208;screening method to identify single and di&#8208;atom metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces for the ORR. Based on formation&#8208;energy calculations and micro&#8208;kinetic modelling of reaction pathways using intermediate binding free energies, we have identified four potentially interesting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and fifteen di&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with relatively high estimated catalytic activity at 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE. Among the best SACs, MnNC shows high stability in both acidic and alkaline media according to our model. For the DACs, we found four possible candidates, MnMn, FeFe, CoCo, and MnNi doped on quad&#8208;atom vacancy sites having considerable stability over a wide pH range. The remaining SACs and DACs with high activity are either less stable or show a stability region at an alkaline pH.

         <title>Isomer Effect on Energy Storage of &#960;&#8208;Extended S&#8208;Shaped Double[6]Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene of thienothiophene core fused with two hexabenzocoronene units exhibits excellent performance as an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery. The isomer (PP and MM) with more interlayer distance exhibited a high lithium storage capability compared to the other isomer and racemic mixture. Helical nanographene anodes display excellent rate capability, superior long&#8208;term cycling performance, and recyclability.







Abstract
Recently, chiral and nonplanar cutouts of graphene have been the favorites due to their unique optical, electronic, and redox properties and high solubility compared with their planar counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress in helicenes, &#960;&#8208;extended heterohelicenes have not been widely explored. As an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the racemic mixture of &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene containing thienothiophene core exhibited a high lithium storage capability, attaining a specific capacity of 424&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent rate capability and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance over 6000&#8197;cycles with negligible fade. As a first report, the &#960;&#8208;extended helicene isomer (PP and MM), with the more interlayer distance that helps faster diffusion of ions, has exhibited a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with long&#8208;term cycling performance over 1500&#8197;cycles compared to the less performing MP and PM isomer and racemic mixture (150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). As supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, a unique molecular design of nanographenes with a fixed (helical) molecular geometry, avoiding restacking of the layers, renders better performance as an anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.

Abstract
A series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) as well as corroborated by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln3O2(CN3) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln3O2(CN3) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Escape from Hydrofunctionalization: Palladium Hydride&#8208;Enabled Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes and Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of dienes and enynes is reported. This mild protocol harnesses visible light to enhance the hydricity of PdH species, enabling a chemoselectivity switch of the hydropalladation step. This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans.







Abstract
Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron&#8208;rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for cascade annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro&#8208;fused tricyclic frameworks.

         <title>From Biomimicking to Bioinspired Design of Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction to C1 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;inspired chemical engineering (NICE) approach for the design of nature&#8208;inspired electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to C1 products is presented in this Minireview.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is a promising approach to maintain a carbon cycle balance and produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, CO2RR technology is far from mature, since the conventional CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from low activity (leading to currents &lt;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell), stability (&lt;120&#8197;h), and selectivity. Hence, they cannot meet the requirements for commercial applications (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &gt;8000&#8197;h, &gt;90&#8201;% selectivity). Significant improvements are possible by taking inspiration from nature, considering biological organisms that efficiently catalyze the CO2 to various products. In this minireview, we present recent examples of enzyme&#8208;inspired and enzyme&#8208;mimicking CO2RR electrocatalysts enabling the production of C1 products with high faradaic efficiency (FE). At present, these designs do not typically follow a methodical approach, but rather focus on isolated features of biological systems. To achieve disruptive change, we advocate a systematic design methodology that leverages fundamental mechanisms associated with desired properties in nature and adapts them to the context of engineering applications.

         <title>Delocalized Isoelectronic Heterostructured FeCoOxSy Catalysts with Tunable Electron Density for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delocalized isoelectronic heterojunction catalyst (DIHC) is constructed by substituting isoelectronic S for O to further complement the heterojunction theory. With the formation of the more catalytic sites in the DIHC, the catalytic behaviors at the heterojunction interface are regulated to realize the continuous capture&#8212;adsorption&#8212;catalysis of Li2Sn, thus improving the sulfur reaction kinetics and performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV/Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano&#8208;like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Impressively, even resting for about 17&#8197;days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Bulky Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline materials in which a bulky iptycene derivative (pentiptycene) exhibits rotational dynamics in the solid state is reported by Hajime Ito, Mingoo Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309694). It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable the further design of systems in which large and complex molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Stokes fluorescence lifetime imaging in living cells was demonstrated by Rachel C. Evans et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202308602). This was achieved through the design of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle probes based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells suggest that the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.

The synthesis of new molecules and materials does not always involve creating bonds.&#160;In their Research Article (e202310354), Jorge Albalad, Inhar Imaz, Daniel Maspoch et&#8197;al. show how bond scission becomes a powerful synthetic tool to design new molecules and materials when the cleavage step is quantitative, selective, and carefully controlled. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, unprecedented Rh(II)&#8208;based architectures (clusters, a crown, and a macrocycle) were obtained through the retrosynthetic disassembly of metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) via Clip&#8208;off Chemistry.

         <title>Reaction Chemistry at Discrete Organometallic Fragments on Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Black phosphorus (bP) is a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals material unique in its potential to serve as a support for single&#8208;site catalysts due to its similarity to molecular phosphines, ligands quintessential in homogeneous catalysis. However, there is scarcity of synthetic methods to install single metal centers on the bP lattice. Here we demonstrate the functionalization of bP nanosheets with molecular Re and Mo complexes. A suite of characterization techniques, including infrared, X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning tunneling electron microscopy corroborate that the functionalized nanosheets contain a high density of discrete metal centers directly bound to the bP surface. Moreover, the supported metal centers are chemically accessible and can undergo ligand exchange transformations without detaching from the surface. The steric and electronic properties of bP as a ligand are estimated with respect to molecular phosphines. Sterically, bP resembles tri(tolyl)phosphine when monodentate to a metal center, and bis(diphenylphosphino)propane when bidentate, whereas electronically bP is a &#963;&#8208;donor as strong as a trialkyl phosphine. This work is foundational in elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand and underscores the viability of using bP as a basis for single&#8208;site catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic ensembling design of hierarchically ordered FAU&#8208;type zeolite frameworks for vacuum gas oil hydrocracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites hold importance as catalysts and membranes across numerous industrial processes that produce most of the world&#8217;s fuels and chemicals. In zeolite catalysis, the rate of molecular diffusion inside the micropore channels defines the catalyst longevity and selectivity, thereby influencing the catalytic process efficiency. Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well&#8208;organized nanoporous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass&#8208;transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post&#8208;synthetic design for the synthesis of hierarchically ordered&#160;FAU&#8208;type zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal (P6mm) and 3D&#8208;cubic (Ia[[EQUATION]]d) mesopore channels formed by a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant&#8208;zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion&#8208;specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, here, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared hierarchically ordered zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle&#8208;distillates in low&#8208;pressure vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy&#8208;efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect&#8208;free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel&#160;microenvironment, and consequently, an&#160;intriguing H2/CO2 separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656~5.4, H2 permeance of 964~2745 gas permeation unit).&#160;Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non&#8208;destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full&#8208;chain demonstration for membrane fabrication&#8208;separation validation&#8208;microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution by Alkynyl Copper Driven Dearomatization and Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric transformations via dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom as the substrates. In this case, the challenging dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal center can perform as an intriguing type of driving force for dearomatization, which is applied to the development of a novel model for seldomly studied asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8211;N axis. Gram&#8208;scale test and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential chemical transformation space of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced [3+2] Cycloaddition of Carbenes and Nitriles: A Versatile Approach to Oxazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a photoinduced protocol for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important oxazole molecules using diazo and nitrile as reactants. The process involves the initial photolysis of diazo to afford singlet carbenes which are tapped by nitriles in a [3+2] cycloaddition fashion to give a library of substituted oxazoles. With di&#8208;nitrile compounds, useful bis&#8208;oxazoles were obtained. The applicability of the present transformation has been showcased through the expedient synthesis of small molecule drugs and biologically relevant molecules viz. felbinac, pimprinine, texamine, ugnenenazole etc. The protocol is also useful for the generation of &#160;2H and 13C isotope labelled oxazoles. A merging photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry have been demonstrated for scaling up the reaction. The non&#8208;requirement of metal catalysis or photosensitizers to harness the light energy with blue light sufficing the execution of the reaction makes it a versatile and general protocol for the synthesis of structurally diverse oxazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Photocatalysts Containing Segregated &#960;&#8208;Conjugation Units with Electron&#8208;Trap Activity for Efficient Natural&#8208;light&#8208;driven Bacterial Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of highly efficient and metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation under natural light is a major challenge in photocatalytic antibiosis. Herein, we developed an acidizing solvent&#8208;thermal approach for inserting a non&#8208;conjugated ethylenediamine segment into the conjugated planes of 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride to generate a photocatalyst containing segregated &#960;&#8208;conjugation units (EDA&#8208;PTCDA). Under natural light, EDA&#8208;PTCDA achieved 99.9% inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (60 and 45 min), which is the highest efficiency among all the natural light antibacterial reports. The difference in the surface potential and excited charge density corroborated the possibility of a built&#8208;in electron&#8208;trap effect of the non&#8208;conjugated segments of EDA&#8208;PTCDA, thus forming a highly active EDA&#8208;PTDA/bacteria interface. In addition, EDA&#8208;PTCDA exhibited negligible toxicity and damage to normal tissue cells. This catalyst provides a new opportunity for photocatalytic antibiosis under natural light conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development of Non&#8208;Invasive Imaging Probes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The last two decades have witnessed a major revolution in the field of tumor immunology including clinical progress using various immunotherapy strategies. These advances have highlighted the potential for approaches that harness the power of the immune system to fight against cancer. While cancer immunotherapies have shown significant clinical successes, patient responses vary widely due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of tumors and immune responses, calling for reliable biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy. Especially, stratifying responding individuals from non&#8208;responders during early stages of treatment could help avoid long&#8208;term damages and tailor personalized treatments. In efforts to develop non&#8208;invasive means for accurately evaluating and predicting tumor response to immunotherapy, multiple affinity&#8208;based agents targeting immune cell markers and checkpoint molecules have been developed and advanced to clinical trials. In addition, researchers have recently turned their attention to substrate and activity&#8208;based imaging probes that can provide real&#8208;time, functional assessment of immune response to treatment. Here, we highlight some of those recently designed probes that image functional proteases as biomarkers of cancer immunotherapy with a focus on their chemical design and detection modalities and discuss challenges and opportunities for the development of imaging tools utilized in cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Gain in Organic Photodetectors Using the Polymer with Singlet Open&#8208;Shell Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodetectors are critical components in intelligent optoelectronic systems, and photomultiplication&#8208;capable devices are essential for detecting weak optical signals. Despite significant advances, developing a photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors with high gain and low noise current simultaneously remains challenging. In this work, a new conjugated polymer PDN with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state is introduced in active layers for electron capture, and the corresponding PDN&#8208;based photodetectors exhibited an enhanced photoelectric gain and decreased dark current density at a low forward bias. At 1.5 V, the PDN&#8208;based ternary photodetector have the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 2552.3 % and the specific detectivity of 1.4 &#215; 10e14 Jones at 710 nm calculated by the measured noise current, with the gain 22 times higher than that of the control group. This study provides an approach for exploiting polymers with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state to enhance the gain of organic photodetectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Photocatalytic Decaging for Remote&#8208;Controlled Spatiotemporal Activation in Living Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled stimuli is a capti&#8208;vating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT&#8208;NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740 nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT&#8208;NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR&#8208;triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins in living cells. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer&#8208;aided screening, CAT&#8208;NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled rescue of drug molecules. Given its broad adaptability, this CAT&#8208;NIR system may open new opportunities for manipulating the functions of bioactive molecules in living animals using external NIR light with spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Energy Transfer and White&#8208;Light Emission in Chirality&#8208;Controlled Crystallization&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Dimensional Co&#8208;assemblies from Donor and Acceptor Dye&#8208;Conjugated Polylactides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving predictable and programmable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures with specific functions from exclusively organic soft materials remains a scientific challenge. This article unravels stereocomplex crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly as a facile method for producing thermally robust discrete 2D&#8208;platelets of diamond shape from degradable semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) scaffolds. The method involves co&#8208;assembling two PLA stereoisomers, namely, PY&#8208;PDLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA, which form stereocomplex (SC)&#8208;crystals in isopropanol. By conjugating a well&#8208;known F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor dye, namely, pyrene (PY) and naphthalene monoimide (NMI), respectively, to the chain termini of these two interacting stereoisomers, a thermally robust FRET process can be stimulated from the 2D array of the co&#8208;assembled dyes on the thermally resilient SC&#8208;PLA crystal surfaces. Uniquely, by decorating the surface of the SC&#8208;PLA crystals with an externally immobilized guest dye, Rhodamine&#8208;B, similar diamond&#8208;shaped structures could be produced that exhibit pure white&#8208;light emission through a surface&#8208;induced two&#8208;step cascade energy transfer process. The FRET response in these systems displays remarkable dependence on the intrinsic crystalline packing, which could be modulated by the chirality of the co&#8208;assembling PLA chains. This is supported by comparing the properties of similar 2D platelets generated from two homochiral PLLAs (PY&#8208;PLLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA) labeled with the same FRET pair.</dc:description>

Herein, we rescued a Li&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups.

         <title>Ag+&#8208;Doped InSe Nanosheets for Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer toward Large&#8208;Current Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is an appealing approach to CO2 utilization through CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) to ethanol at high current density; however, the commonly used Cu&#8208;based catalysts cannot sustain large current during CO2ER despite their capability for ethanol production. Herein, we report that Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets with Se vacancies can address this grand challenge in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the Ag+ doping, which can tailor the electronic structure of InSe while diversifying catalytically active sites, enables the formation of key reaction intermediates and their sequential evolution into ethanol. More importantly, such a material can well work for large&#8208;current conditions in MEA electrolyzers with In2+ species stabilized via electron transfer from Ag to Se. Remarkably, in an MEA electrolyzer by coupling cathodic CO2ER with anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the optimal catalyst exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 68.7% and a partial current density of 186.6 mA cm&#8722;2 on the cathode with a full&#8208;cell ethanol energy efficiency of 26.1% at 3.0 V. This work opens an avenue for large&#8208;current production of ethanol from CO2 with high selectivity and energy efficiency by rationally designing electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multidimensional Approach to Modulating Ionizable Lipids for High&#8208;Performing and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a powerful multidimensional design approach for the modulation of ionizable lipids (IL) using one&#8208;step chemistry based on the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction, which enables simplified screening of high&#8208;performing ILs for in vivo mRNA delivery. The inherent structure of ILs, which controls organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery, and the isomeric design of ILs, which affects the efficacy in vivo, were elucidated for this new IL library.







Abstract
The development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has enabled a successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines. However, disclosure of design principles for the core component&#8208;ionizable lipids (ILs), improving the delivery efficacy and organ targeting of LNPs, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a powerful strategy to modulate ILs in one&#8208;step chemistry using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) under mild conditions. A large IL library of new structures was established simply and efficiently through a multidimensional approach, allowing us to identify the top&#8208;performing ILs in delivering mRNA via the formulated LNPs. Adjusting the skeleton of ILs has transformed the organ&#8208;specific and robust transfection in mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen following different administration routes. Of note, a series of isomeric ILs were prepared and we found that the isomers mattered greatly in the performance of LNPs for mRNA delivery. Furthermore, owing to the bis&#8208;amide bonds formed in the Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction, the ILs within LNPs may form hydrogen bonding intermolecularly, facilitating the colloidal stabilization of LNPs. This work provides clues to the rapid discovery and rational design of IL candidates, assisting the application of mRNA therapeutics.

         <title>Reversible Amidation Chemistry Enables Closed&#8208;Loop Chemical Recycling of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites to Monomers and Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling of mechanically robust carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites to intact carbon fibers and pure monomers has been achieved by using reversible amidation chemistry. The polymer matrices can be completely depolymerized under acidic conditions at ambient temperature, allowing the separation and recovery of carbon fibers with fully restored mechanical properties as well as pure monomers with high yields.







Abstract
Highly efficient recycling of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites into monomers and fibers is a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a closed&#8208;loop recycling approach for carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites using reversible amidation chemistry, which enables the complete recovery of intact carbon fibers and pure monomers. The polymer network, synthesized by amidation between a macromonomer linear polyethyleneimine and a bifunctional maleic anhydride cross&#8208;linker, serves as a matrix for the construction of composites with exceptional mechanical properties, thermal stability and solvent resistance. The matrices can be fully depolymerized under the acidic condition at ambient temperature, allowing the effective separation and recovery of both carbon fibers and the two monomers. The reclaimed carbon fibers retain nearly identical mechanical properties to pristine ones, while pure monomers are recycled with high separation yields (&gt;93&#8201;%). They can be reused in for multiple cycles for the manufacture of new composites, whose mechanical properties recover over 95&#8201;% of their original properties. This line of research presents a promising approach for the design of high&#8208;performance and sustainable thermoset composites, offering significant environmental and economic benefits.

         <title>Strong Protein Adhesives through Lanthanide&#8208;enhanced Structure Folding and Stack Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular engineering strategy was developed to fabricate exotic protein adhesives with ultra&#8208;strong adhesion performance, extreme&#8208;temperature resistance, and underwater stability. The lanthanide&#8208;induced conformational transition enhanced the stacking density of adhesive protein moieties, thus endowing stronger molecular interactions. This work offers a versatile approach to fabricate robust bio&#8208;adhesives with multiple desired properties.







Abstract
Generating strong adhesion by engineered proteins has the potential for high technical applications. Current studies of adhesive proteins are primarily limited to marine organisms, e.g., mussel adhesive proteins. Here, we present a modular engineering strategy to generate a type of exotic protein adhesives with super strong adhesion behaviors. In the protein complexes, the lanmodulin (LanM) underwent &#945;&#8208;helical conformational transition induced by lanthanides, thereby enhancing the stacking density and molecular interactions of adhesive protein. The resulting adhesives exhibited outstanding lap&#8208;shear strength of &#8776;31.7&#8197;MPa, surpassing many supramolecular and polymer adhesives. The extreme temperature (&#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C) resistance capacity and underwater adhesion performance can significantly broaden their practical application scenarios. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments further demonstrated the persistent adhesion performance for surgical sealing and healing applications.

Abstract
We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective acylboration of 1,3&#8208;butadienylboronate with acyl fluorides. Under the developed conditions, the reactions provide (Z)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones bearing an &#945;&#8208;tertiary stereocenter with high Z&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivities. While direct access to highly enantioenriched E&#8208;isomers was not successful, we showed that such molecules can be synthesized with excellent E&#8208;selectivity and optical purities via Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkene isomerization from the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers. The orthogonal chemical reactivities of the functional groups embedded in the ketone products allow for diverse chemoselective transformations, which provides a valuable platform for further derivatization.

         <title>Monitoring the Cascade of Tumor&#8208;specific Immune Response in vivo via Chemoenzymatic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cascade of cellular immune response, including the recruitment and maturation of dendritic cell (DC), the activation of T cells in the draining lymph nodes and their transfer to the tumors, is monitored in vivo by integrating the pore&#8208;forming alginate gel promoted DC concentration and maturation with chemoenzymatic proximity&#8208;labeling.







Abstract
Monitoring the highly dynamic and complex immune response remains a great challenge owing to the lack of reliable and specific approaches. Here, we develop a strategy to monitor the cascade of tumor immune response through the cooperation of pore&#8208;forming alginate gel with chemoenzymatic proximity&#8208;labeling. A macroporous gel containing tumor&#8208;associated antigens, adjuvants, and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines is utilized to recruit endogenous DCs and enhance their maturation in vivo. The mature DCs are then modified with GDP&#8208;fucose&#8208;fucosyltransferase (GDP&#8208;Fuc&#8208;Fuct) via the self&#8208;catalysis of fucosyltransferase (Fuct). Following the migration of the obtained Fuct&#8208;DCs to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), the molecular recognition mediated interaction of DCs and T cells leads to the successful decoration of T cells with GDP&#8208;Fuc&#8208;azide through the Fuct catalyzed proximity&#8208;labeling. Therefore, the activated tumor&#8208;specific T cells in dLNs and tumors can be identified through bioorthogonal labeling, opening up a new avenue for studying the immune mechanism of tumors in situ.

         <title>Tris&#8208;benzo[cd]indole Cyanine Enables the NIR&#8208;photosensitized Radical and Thiol&#8208;ene Polymerizations at 940&#8197;nm</title>

         <dc:description>
An original tris&#8208;benzo[cd]indole heptamethine cyanine with tailored solubility and redox properties promotes an efficient photoelectron transfer in a three&#8208;component photoinitiating system allowing the regeneration of the cationic dye. This system is used to perform radical and thiol&#8208;ene polymerizations with conversions up to 100&#8201;% upon near&#8208;infrared LED irradiation.







Abstract
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing heptamethine (HM+) incorporating three bulky benzo[cd]indole heterocycles was designed to efficiently prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the dye, which results in a strong enhancement of its photoinitiating reactivity as compared to a parent bis&#8208;benzo[cd]indole heptamethine (HMCl+) used as a reference system. In this context, we highlight an efficient free&#8208;radical NIR&#8208;polymerization up to a 100&#8201;% acrylates C=C bonds conversion even under air conditions. Such an important initiating performance was obtained by incorporating our NIR&#8208;sensitizer into a three&#8208;component system leading to its self&#8208;regeneration. This original photoredox cycle was thoroughly investigated through the identification of each intermediary species using EPR spectroscopy.

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoop Polymers based on Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalenes for Charge Storage in Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiaromatic dibenzopentalenes in nanohoop polymers invoke an intriguing interplay of linear vs. radial conjugation, depending on the electronic nature of the comomoner unit, and improved charge storage properties due to the presence of the nanohoops compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer.







Abstract
With their bent &#960;&#8208;systems, cyclic conjugation and inherent cavities, conjugated nanohoops are attractive for organic electronics applications. For ease of processing and morphological stability, an incorporation into polymers is desirable, but to date was hampered with few exceptions by synthetic difficulties. We herein present a unique strategy for the synthesis of conjugated nanohoop polymers using a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) as central connector. We demonstrate this versatility by synthesizing three electronically diverse copolymers with dithienyldiketo(pyrrolopyrrol), fluorene and carbazole comonomers, and report the first donor&#8208;acceptor nanohoop polymer. Optoelectronic investigations reveal the prevalence of cyclic or linear conjugation, depending on the comonomer unit, and ambipolar electrochemical properties through the antiaromatic character of the DBP units. As the first report on using conjugated nanohoops for charge storage as positive electrode materials, we show a significant improvement in battery performance in a nanohoop&#8208;containing polymer compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer. We believe this study will pave the way for the synthesis of a diverse range of nanohoop polymers and further stimulate their exploration for charge storage in batteries.

         <title>Synthesis of a Porous [14]Annulene Graphene Nanoribbon and a Porous [30]Annulene Graphene Nanosheet on Metal Surfaces</title>

Selective syntheses of one&#8208;dimensional graphene nanoribbons containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111) have been achieved. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing and tuning the reaction pathways were proposed.







Abstract
The electrical and mechanical properties of graphene&#8208;based materials can be tuned by the introduction of nanopores, which are sensitively related to the size, morphology, density, and location of nanopores. The synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional graphene nanostructures containing well&#8208;defined nonplanar nanopores has been challenging due to the intrinsic steric hindrance. Herein, we report the selective synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111), starting from a same precursor. The formation of distinct products on the two substrates originates from the different thermodynamics and kinetics of coupling reactions. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing the reaction pathways were proposed. In addition, the combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the electronic structures of porous graphene structures, demonstrating the impact of nonplanar pores on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of molecules.

Distinct selectivity control along with highly efficient H2 production are achieved in photocatalytic conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids by tuning the nature of Pt species deposited on CdS.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic lignocellulose conversion is a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals, but selectivity control remains a challenging goal in this field. Here, we report efficient and selective conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids to tartaric acid derivatives, &#945;&#8208;keto acids, and H2 using Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. Pt nanoparticles on CdS selectively produce tartaric acid derivatives via C&#8722;C coupling, while atomically dispersed Pt on CdS switches product selectivity to the oxidation reaction to produce &#945;&#8208;keto acids. The atomically dispersed Pt species stabilized by Pt&#8722;S bonds promote the activation of the hydroxyl group and thus switch product selectivity from tartaric acid derivatives to &#945;&#8208;keto acids. A broad range of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids was applied for preparing the corresponding tartaric acid derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids over the two Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. This work highlights the unique performance of metal sulfides in coupling reactions and demonstrates a strategy for rationally tuning product selectivity by engineering the interaction between metal sulfide and cocatalyst.

         <title>Alternatives to Styrene&#8208; and Diisobutylene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Membrane Protein Solubilization via Nanodisc Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene&#8208; and diisobutylene&#8208;based amphiphilic copolymers are invaluable tools for the extraction of integral membrane proteins. However, they have several issues that limit their efficacy and applicability. A tailorable polymeric platform is now introduced that overcomes many of these limitations, including having low UV absorbance, high protein extraction yields, and retention of native&#8208;like protein structure, as well as being readily synthesized.







Abstract
Styrene&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (SMAs), and related amphiphilic copolymers, are promising tools for isolating and studying integral membrane proteins in a native&#8208;like state. However, they do not exhibit this ability universally, as several reports have found that SMAs and related amphiphilic copolymers show little to no efficiency when extracting specific membrane proteins. Recently, it was discovered that esterified SMAs could enhance the selective extraction of trimeric Photosystem I from the thylakoid membranes of thermophilic cyanobacteria; however, these polymers are susceptible to saponification that can result from harsh preparation or storage conditions. To address this concern, we herein describe the development of &#945;&#8208;olefin&#8208;maleic acid copolymers (&#945;MAs) that can extract trimeric PSI from cyanobacterial membranes with the highest extraction efficiencies observed when using any amphiphilic copolymers, including diisobutylene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic acid (DIBMA) and functionalized SMA samples. Furthermore, we will show that &#945;MAs facilitate the formation of photosystem I&#8208;containing nanodiscs that retain an annulus of native lipids and a native&#8208;like activity. We also highlight how &#945;MAs provide an agile, tailorable synthetic platform that enables fine&#8208;tuning hydrophobicity, controllable molar mass, and consistent monomer incorporation while overcoming shortcomings of prior amphiphilic copolymers.

     alt="Alternatives to Styrene- and Diisobutylene-Based Copolymers for Membrane Protein Solubilization via Nanodisc Formation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Styrene- and diisobutylene-based amphiphilic copolymers are invaluable tools for the extraction of integral membrane proteins. However, they have several issues that limit their efficacy and applicability. A tailorable polymeric platform is now introduced that overcomes many of these limitations, including having low UV absorbance, high protein extraction yields, and retention of native-like protein structure, as well as being readily synthesized.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Molybdenum Complexes Bearing PNP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligand toward Ammonia Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We newly designed and prepared a novel molybdenum complex bearing a 4&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand, based on the bond dissociation free energies of the N&#8722;H bonds in molybdenum&#8208;imide complexes bearing various substituted PNP pincer ligands. The complex worked as an excellent catalyst toward ammonia formation, where up to 3580 equivalents of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst.







Abstract
We newly designed and prepared a novel molybdenum complex bearing a 4&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand, based on the bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in molybdenum&#8208;imide complexes bearing various substituted pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands. The complex worked as an excellent catalyst toward ammonia formation from the reaction of an atmospheric pressure of dinitrogen with samarium diiodide as a reductant and water as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions, where up to 3580 equivalents of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. The catalytic activity was significantly improved by one order of magnitude larger than that observed when using the complex before modification.

         <title>Utilizing the Hofmeister Effect to Induce Hydrogelation of Nonionic Supramolecular Polymers into a Therapeutic Depot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic supramolecular polymers, formed by self&#8208;assembly of drug&#8208;peptide conjugates, can be induced to undergo a sol&#8208;gel transition using the Hofmeister Effect, in which the well&#8208;hydrated anions disrupt the hydration shell around the supramolecular polymers by polarizing the water molecules closely bound to their surfaces.







Abstract
Nonionic hydrogels are of particular interest for long&#8208;term therapeutic implantation due to their minimal immunogenicity relative to their charged counterparts. However, in situ formation of nonionic supramolecular hydrogels under physiological conditions has been a challenging task. In this context, we report on our discovery of salt&#8208;triggered hydrogelation of nonionic supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by self&#8208;assembling prodrug hydrogelators (SAPHs) through the Hofmeister effect. The designed SAPHs consist of two SN&#8208;38 units, which is an active metabolite of the anticancer drug irinotecan, and a short peptide grafted with two or four oligoethylene glycol (OEG) segments. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the resultant nonionic SPs can be triggered to gel upon addition of phosphate salts. Our 1H NMR studies revealed that the added phosphates led to a change in the chemical shift of the methylene protons, suggestive of a disruption of the water&#8208;ether hydrogen bonds and consequent reorganization of the hydration shell surrounding the SPs. This deshielding effect, commensurate with the amount of salt added, likely promoted associative interactions among the SAPH filaments to percolate into a 3D network. The formed hydrogels exhibited a sustained release profile of SN&#8208;38 hydrogelator that acted potently against cancer cells.

         <title>Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of hollow nanoreactors with a hollow multishelled structure and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles is reported. The hollow nanoreactors exhibit size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation because of differences in the energy barrier of substrate adsorption and steric hindrance.







Abstract
Mimicking the structures and functions of cells to create artificial organelles has spurred the development of efficient strategies for production of hollow nanoreactors with biomimetic catalytic functions. However, such structure are challenging to fabricate and are thus rarely reported. We report the design of hollow nanoreactors with hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles. Starting from a molecular&#8208;level design strategy, well&#8208;defined hollow multishelled structure phenolic resins (HoMS&#8208;PR) and carbon (HoMS&#8208;C) submicron particles were accurately constructed. HoMS&#8208;C serves as an excellent, versatile platform, owing to its tunable properties with tailored functional sites for achieving precise spatial location of metal nanoparticles, internally encapsulated (Pd@HoMS&#8208;C) or externally supported (Pd/HoMS&#8208;C). Impressively, the combination of the delicate nanoarchitecture and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles endow the pair of nanoreactors with size&#8211;shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation, including high activity and selectivity of Pd@HoMS&#8208;C for small aliphatic substrates and Pd/HoMS&#8208;C for large aromatic substrates. Theoretical calculations provide insight into the pair of nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in energy barrier of substrate adsorption. This work provides guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of hollow nanoreactors with precisely located active sites and a finely modulated microenvironment by mimicking the functions of cells.

         <title>In situ Observation of Evolving H2 and Solid Electrolyte Interphase Development at Potassium Insertion Materials within Highly Concentrated Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Properties of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) found in a highly concentrated K(FSA)0.6(OTf)0.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1H2O electrolyte are being revealed through advanced in situ methods. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) reveals a passivating but discontinuous SEI film. Operando mass spectrometry (OEMS) measurements confirm a shift in the evolution of detectable H2 from &#8722;0.9&#8197;V to &lt;&#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl when changing from dilute to concentrated electrolytes.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is key to stable, high voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as a protective barrier that prevents electrolyte decomposition. The SEI is thought to play a similar role in highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) for emerging aqueous batteries, but its properties remain unknown. In this work, we utilized advanced scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and operando electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) techniques to gain deeper insight into the SEI that occurs within highly concentrated WISEs. As a model, we focus on a 55&#8197;mol/kg K(FSA)0.6(OTf)0.4 electrolyte and a 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide negative electrode. For the first time, our work showed distinctly passivating structures with slow apparent electron transfer rates alike to the SEI found in LIBs. In situ analyses indicated stable passivating structures when PTCDI was stepped to low potentials (&#8776;&#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl). However, the observed SEI was discontinuous at the surface and H2 evolution occurred as the electrode reached more extreme potentials. OEMS measurements further confirmed a shift in the evolution of detectable H2 from &#8722;0.9&#8197;V to &lt;&#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl when changing from dilute to concentrated electrolytes. In all, our work shows a combined approach of traditional battery measurements with in situ analyses for improving characterization of other unknown SEI structures.

However, the observed SEI was discontinuous at the surface and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution occurred as the electrode reached more extreme potentials. OEMS measurements further confirmed a shift in the evolution of detectable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from &#8722;0.9&#8197;V to &amp;lt;&#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl when changing from dilute to concentrated electrolytes. In all, our work shows a combined approach of traditional battery measurements with in situ analyses for improving characterization of other unknown SEI structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds ((CH3)2C(PhY)&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)PhY) were prepared by selective cationic dimerization of &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (&#945;MS) derivatives (CH2=C(CH3)PhY) with p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) via &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H scission. They were subsequently used as reversible chain transfer agents for sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization of &#945;MS via &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;C scission in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts such as SnCl4. In particular, exo&#8208;olefin compounds with electron&#8208;donating substituents, such as a 4&#8208;MeO group (Y) on the aromatic ring, worked as efficient cationic RAFT agents for &#945;MS to produce poly(&#945;MS) with controlled molecular weights and exo&#8208;olefin terminals. Other exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)(4&#8208;MeOPh)) with various R groups were prepared by different methods to examine the effects of R groups on the cationic RAFT polymerization. A sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization also proceeded for isobutylene (IB) with the exo&#8208;olefin &#945;MS dimer ((CH3)2C(Ph)&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Ph). Furthermore, telechelic poly(IB) with exo&#8208;olefins at both terminals was obtained with a bifunctional RAFT agent containing two exo&#8208;olefins. Finally, block copolymers of &#945;MS and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were prepared via mechanistic transformation from cationic to radical RAFT polymerization using exo&#8208;olefin terminals containing 4&#8208;MeOPh groups as common sulfur&#8208;free RAFT groups for both cationic and radical polymerizations.

         <title>Promoter&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Cyclic Mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic 32&#8208;mer polymannoside, which represents the largest cyclic polysaccharide synthesized so far, was successfully constructed by a promoter&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach under high&#8208;dilution conditions. Analysis of the cyclic 2&#8208;mer, 4&#8208;mer, 8&#8208;mer, 16&#8208;mer, and 32&#8208;mer mannosides by advanced NMR spectroscopy and computational studies indicated that the cyclic mannosides of various sizes adopted different conformational states and shapes.







Abstract
Cyclodextrins are widely used as carriers of small molecules for drug delivery owing to their remarkable host properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, cyclic oligosaccharides with different sizes and shapes are limited. Cycloglycosylation of ultra&#8208;large bifunctional saccharide precursors is challenging due to the constrained conformational spaces. Herein we report a promoter&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach for the synthesis of cyclic &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer. Cycloglycosylation of the bifunctional thioglycosides and (Z)&#8208;ynenoates was found to be highly dependent on the promoters. In particular, a sufficient amount of a gold(I) complex played a key role in the proper preorganization of the ultra&#8208;large cyclic transition state, providing a cyclic 32&#8208;mer polymannoside, which represents the largest synthetic cyclic polysaccharide to date. NMR experiments and a computational study revealed that the cyclic 2&#8208;mer, 4&#8208;mer, 8&#8208;mer, 16&#8208;mer, and 32&#8208;mer mannosides adopted different conformational states and shapes.

         <title>Effective Activation of Strong C&#8722;Cl Bonds for Highly Selective Photosynthesis of Bibenzyl via Homo&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu loaded ZnO nanoparticles exhibit robust performance in photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling of inert benzyl chloride. Compared to previously reported Cu/TiO2, the selectivity towards bibenzyl increases from 57 to 93&#8201;%. Cu loading enhances the reactant adsorption, C&#8722;Cl bond activation and charge separation/transfer. The moderate oxidation of 2&#8208;propanol by ZnO is a key factor in alleviating the generation of byproduct toluene.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling of organic halides has been successfully achieved in homogeneous catalysis, while the limitation, e.g., the dependence on rare noble metals, complexity of the metal&#8208;ligand catalylst and the poor catalyst stability and recyclability, needs to be tackled for a green process. The past few years have witnessed heterogeneous photocatalysis as a green and novel method for organic synthesis processes. However, the study on C&#8722;C coupling of chloride substrates is rare due to the extremely high bond energy of C&#8722;Cl bond (327&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Here, we report a robust heterogeneous photocatalyst (Cu/ZnO) to drive the homo&#8208;coupling of benzyl chloride with high efficiency, which achieves an unprecedented high selectivity of bibenzyl (93&#8201;%) and yield rate of 92&#8201;% at room temperature. Moreover, this photocatalytic process has been validated for C&#8722;C coupling of 10 benzylic chlorides all with high yields. In addition, the excellent stability has been observed for 8 cycles of reactions. With detailed characterization and DFT calculation, the high selectivity is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of reactants, stabilization of intermediates (benzyl radicals) for the selective coupling by the Cu loading and the moderate oxidation ability of the ZnO support, besides the promoted charge separation and transfer by Cu species.

         <title>Photodegradation of CuBi2O4 Films Evidenced by Fast Formation of Metallic Bi using Operando Surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray Scattering
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface sensitivity of Total Scattering/atomic Pair&#8208;Distribution Function (TS&#8208;PDF) and Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) enables to study the interplay between structural changes and photoelectrochemical performances of photocathodes. CuBi2O4 photocorrodes to metallic Bi and Cu. It further releases Cu ions in the electrolyte and forms BiPO4 structures at its surface. The rapid formation of Bi correlates with an abrupt drop of photocurrents.







Abstract
CuBi2O4 has recently emerged as a promising photocathode for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its fast degradation under operation currently poses a limit to its application. Here, we report a novel method to study operando the semiconductor&#8208;electrolyte interface during PEC operation by surface&#8208;sensitive high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering. We find that a fast decrease in the generated photocurrents correlates directly with the formation of a metallic Bi phase. We further show that the slower formation of metallic Cu, as well as the dissolution of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, further affect the CuBi2O4 activity and morphology. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the degradation mechanisms affecting CuBi2O4 electrodes under operation and poses the methodological basis to investigate the photocorrosion processes affecting a wide range of PEC materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CuBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has recently emerged as a promising photocathode for photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its fast degradation under operation currently poses a limit to its application. Here, we report a novel method to study operando the semiconductor-electrolyte interface during PEC operation by surface-sensitive high-energy X-ray scattering. We find that a fast decrease in the generated photocurrents correlates directly with the formation of a metallic Bi phase. We further show that the slower formation of metallic Cu, as well as the dissolution of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, further affect the CuBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activity and morphology. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the degradation mechanisms affecting CuBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes under operation and poses the methodological basis to investigate the photocorrosion processes affecting a wide range of PEC materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia via Tuning of N&#8208;Intermediate Adsorption on a Zn&#8722;Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;doped Cu catalyst is used for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. The Faradaic efficiency of NH3 can reach 98.4&#8201;% with a yield rate of 5.8&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1. The Zn dopants play a key role in modulating the adsorption strength of intermediates, enhancing the conversion of nitrite, altering the configuration of adsorbed *NO species to bridge adsorption, and reducing the energy barrier, leading to the high catalytic performance in NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;powered electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) has garnered significant interest as an eco&#8208;friendly and promising substitute for the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the sluggish kinetics hinders its application at a large scale. Herein, we first calculated the N&#8208;containing species (*NO3 and *NO2) binding energy and the free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction over Cu with different metal dopants, and it was shown that Zn was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we designed and synthesized Zn&#8208;doped Cu nanosheets, and the as&#8208;prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3. The maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 could reach 98.4&#8201;% with an outstanding yield rate of 5.8&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is among the best results up to date. The catalyst also had excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, it also presented a FE exceeding 90&#8201;% across a wide potential range and NO3&#8722; concentration range. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Zn doping could modulate intermediates adsorption strength, enhance NO2&#8722; conversion, change the *NO adsorption configuration to a bridge adsorption, and decrease the energy barrier, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>A Spatially Programmable DNA Nanorobot Arm to Modulate Anisotropic Gold Nanoparticle Assembly by Enzymatic Excision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm to modulate the anisotropic assembly of DNA/AuNP superstructures. By specifically controlling nicking excisions on the AuNP surfaces, DNA modifications were generated on a single nanoparticle, thus facilitating anisotropic AuNP assembly. The SPEE strategy is extended to DNA origami surfaces to establish a AuNP assembly platform in a programmable spatially regulated manner.







Abstract
Programmable assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures with precise spatial arrangement has drawn much attention for their unique characteristics in plasmonics and biomedicine. Bio&#8208;inspired methods have already provided programmable, molecular approaches to direct AuNP assemblies using biopolymers. The existing methods, however, predominantly use DNA as scaffolds to directly guide the AuNP interactions to produce intended superstructures. New paradigms for regulating AuNP assembly will greatly enrich the toolbox for DNA&#8208;directed AuNP manipulation and fabrication. Here, we developed a strategy of using a spatially programmable enzymatic nanorobot arm to modulate anisotropic DNA surface modifications and assembly of AuNPs. Through spatial controls of the proximity of the reactants, the locations of the modifications were precisely regulated. We demonstrated the control of the modifications on a single 15&#8197;nm AuNP, as well as on a rectangular DNA origami platform, to direct unique anisotropic AuNP assemblies. This method adds an alternative enzymatic manipulation to DNA&#8208;directed AuNP superstructure assembly.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific m6A Erasing via Conditionally Stabilized CRISPR&#8208;Cas13b Editor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conditional m6A erasing platform was developed. The FKBP*&#8208;dCas13b&#8208;ALKBH5 fusion protein can only be stabilized by Shield&#8208;1 to achieve site&#8208;specific m6A erasing. The removal of Shield&#8208;1 causes rapid degradation and release of the dCas13b&#8208;m6A eraser from target RNAs, while the reversal of m6A editing is much slower, providing an opportunity to study the m6A with minimal steric interference from the bulky dCas13b fusion proteins.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) on RNAs plays an important role in regulating various biological processes and CRIPSR technology has been employed for programmable m6A editing. However, the bulky size of CRISPR protein and constitutively expressed CRISPR/RNA editing enzymes can interfere with the native function of target RNAs and cells. Herein, we reported a conditional m6A editing platform (FKBP*&#8208;dCas13b&#8208;ALK) based on a ligand stabilized dCas13 editor. The inducible expression of this m6A editing system was achieved by adding or removing the Shield&#8208;1 molecule. We further demonstrated that the targeted recruitment of dCas13b&#8208;m6A eraser fusion protein and site&#8208;specific m6A erasing were achieved under the control of Shield&#8208;1. Moreover, the release and degradation of dCas13b fusion protein occurred faster than the restoration of m6A on the target RNAs after Shield&#8208;1 removal, which provides an ideal opportunity to study the m6A function with minimal steric interference from bulky dCas13b fusion protein.

         <title>Interfacial Water Tuning by Intermolecular Spacing for Stable CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toluene&#8208;modified Cu (T&#8722;Cu) presents a suitable intermolecular spacing for enriching CO2 and retarding water transport, as well as forming a hydrophobic interface to inhibit cathodic corrosion, thus leading to high activity and enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products is a promising approach for utilization of renewable energy, in which the interfacial water quantity is critical for both the C2+ product selectivity and the stability of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalytic sites. Functionalization of long&#8208;chain alkyl molecules on a catalyst surface can help to increase its stability, while it also tends to block the transport of water, thus inhibiting the C2+ product formation. Herein, we demonstrate the fine tuning of interfacial water by surface assembly of toluene on Cu nanosheets, allowing for sustained and enriched CO2 supply but retarded water transfer to catalytic surface. Compared to bare Cu with fast cathodic corrosion and long&#8208;chain alkyl&#8208;modified Cu with main CO product, the toluene assembly on Cu nanosheet surface enabled a high Faradaic efficiency of 78&#8201;% for C2+ and a partial current density of 1.81&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The toluene&#8208;modified Cu catalyst further exhibited highly stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion of 400&#8197;h in a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer, suggesting the attractive feature for both efficient C2+ selectivity and excellent stability.

Compared to bare Cu with fast cathodic corrosion and long-chain alkyl-modified Cu with main CO product, the toluene assembly on Cu nanosheet surface enabled a high Faradaic efficiency of 78&#8201;% for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; and a partial current density of 1.81&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The toluene-modified Cu catalyst further exhibited highly stable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion of 400&#8197;h in a membrane-electrode-assembly electrolyzer, suggesting the attractive feature for both efficient C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity and excellent stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding Reaction Horizons: Evidence of the 5&#8208;Deazaflavin Radical Through Photochemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) NMR spectroscopy, we found unambiguous evidence of a one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced 5&#8208;deazaFMN species. Time&#8208;resolved experiments provide a hyperfine mapping for the protons in the aromatic moiety; the relative isotropic hyperfine couplings are correlated to data from density functional theory.







Abstract
Deazaflavins are important analogues of the naturally occurring flavins: riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The use of 5&#8208;deazaflavin as a replacement coenzyme in a number of flavoproteins has proven particularly valuable in unraveling and manipulating their reaction mechanisms. It was frequently reported that one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions in flavoproteins are impeded with 5&#8208;deazaflavin as the cofactor. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the 5&#8208;deazaflavin radical is significantly less stable compared to the respective flavin semiquinone and quickly re&#8208;oxidizes or undergoes disproportionation. The long&#8208;standing paradigm of 5&#8208;deazaflavin being solely a two&#8208;electron/hydride acceptor/donor&#8212;&#8220;a nicotinamide in flavin clothing&#8221;&#8212;needs to be re&#8208;evaluated now with the indirect observation of a one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced (paramagnetic) species using photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>An S=1 Iron(IV) Intermediate Revealed in a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first non&#8208;heme enzymatic S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate is discovered via transient kinetics and spectroscopic (M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, and XANES) characterizations. This novel species is a key intermediate to enable the oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation in the biosynthesis of ovothiol&#8197;A.







Abstract
Ergothioneine (ESH) and ovothiol A (OSHA) are two natural thiol&#8208;histidine derivatives. ESH has been implicated as a longevity vitamin and OSHA inhibits the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma. The key biosynthetic step of ESH and OSHA in the aerobic pathways is the O2&#8208;dependent C&#8722;S bond formation catalyzed by non&#8208;heme iron enzymes (e.g., OvoA in ovothiol biosynthesis), but due to the lack of identification of key reactive intermediate the mechanism of this novel reaction is unresolved. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a kinetically competent S=1 iron(IV) intermediate supported by a four&#8208;histidine ligand environment (three from the protein residues and one from the substrate) in enabling C&#8722;S bond formation in OvoA from Methyloversatilis thermotoleran, which represents the first experimentally observed intermediate spin iron(IV) species in non&#8208;heme iron enzymes. Results reported in this study thus set the stage to further dissect the mechanism of enzymatic oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the OSHA biosynthesis pathway. They also afford new opportunities to study the structure&#8208;function relationship of high&#8208;valent iron intermediates supported by a histidine rich ligand environment.

         <title>Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable and self&#8208;healable liquid crystal elastomer actuator was synthesized by integrating dynamic halogen bonds into an Aza&#8211;Michael addition&#8208;based elastomer network. The obtained LCE not only exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing properties without destroying the liquid crystalline alignment but also allows for dynamic shape programming and corresponding soft robotic demonstrations.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;changing polymeric materials have gained significant attention in the field of bioinspired soft robotics. However, challenges remain in versatilizing the shape&#8208;morphing process to suit different tasks and environments, and in designing systems that combine reversible actuation and self&#8208;healing ability. Here, we report halogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that can be arbitrarily shape&#8208;programmed and that self&#8208;heal under mild thermal or photothermal stimulation. We incorporate halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating diiodotetrafluorobenzene molecules as dynamic supramolecular crosslinks into the LCEs and show that these relatively weak crosslinks are pertinent for their mechanical programming and self&#8208;healing. Utilizing the halogen&#8208;bonded LCEs, we demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept soft robotic motions such as crawling and rolling with programmed velocities. Our results showcase halogen bonding as a promising, yet unexplored tool for the preparation of smart supramolecular constructs for the development of advanced soft actuators.

         <title>Detection of Unfolded Cellular Proteins Using Nanochannel Arrays with Probe&#8208;Functionalized Outer Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a platform to detect unfolded proteins through electrical and optical signals using a nanochannel array with outer&#8208;surface probes. The platform has the ability to differentiate folded and unfolded states of proteins based on the exposure of a single cysteine thiol group, allowing the distinction between normal cells and Huntington's disease mutant cells. This work provides an approach for analyzing proteins with distinct conformations.







Abstract
Nanochannel technology has emerged as a powerful tool for label&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of protein folding/unfolding status. However, utilizing the inner walls of a nanochannel array may cause multiple events even for proteins with the same conformation, posing challenges for accurate identification. Herein, we present a platform to detect unfolded proteins through electrical and optical signals using nanochannel arrays with outer&#8208;surface probes. The detection principle relies on the specific binding between the maleimide groups in outer&#8208;surface probes and the protein cysteine thiols that induce changes in the ionic current and fluorescence intensity responses of the nanochannel array. By taking advantage of this mechanism, the platform has the ability to differentiate folded and unfolded state of proteins based on the exposure of a single cysteine thiol group. The integration of these two signals enhances the reliability and sensitivity of the identification of unfolded protein states and enables the distinction between normal cells and Huntington's disease mutant cells. This study provides an effective approach for the precise analysis of proteins with distinct conformations and holds promise for facilitating the diagnoses of protein conformation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Molecular Stacking and Aggregation Optimization of Photoactive Layer through Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally similar analogues of ADT and NDT are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer for organic solar cells. It is found that the molecular packing behaviors and volatilization of solid additive show significant impact in regulating the morphological properties of photoactive layer, and thus photovoltaic performance.

Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Herein, two structurally similar analogues of anthra[2,3&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (ADT) and naphtho[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (NDT) are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer. We clarify that the perpendicular arrangements of NDT can enlarge the molecular packing space and improve the face&#8208;on stacking of Y6 during the film formation, favoring a more compact and ordered long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction after the removal of NDT under thermal annealing. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked herringbone&#8208;arrangement of ADT along with its non&#8208;volatilization under thermal annealing can induce the coexistence of face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on stacking of blend film. As a result, the NDT treatment shows encouraging effect in improving the photovoltaic performance of devices based on various systems. Particularly, a remarkable PCE of 18.85&#8201;% is achieved in the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated by NDT additive, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 16.41&#8201;% for the control device. This work offers a promising strategy to regulate the molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer towards significantly improved performance and stability of organic solar cells.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiple Phosphorescence from Functionalized Corannulenes: Temperature Sensing and Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corannulene&#8208;based luminophores that exhibit room&#8208;temperature multiple phosphorescence are reported for the first time. We demonstrate utility of these room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials in an afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting diode and for optical temperature sensing stemming from a change in the ratio of multiple phosphorescence yields as a function of temperature.







Abstract
Corannulene&#8208;derived materials have been extensively explored in energy storage and solar cells, however, are rarely documented as emitters in light&#8208;emitting sensors and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), due to low exciton utilization. Here, we report a family of multi&#8208;donor and acceptor (multi&#8208;D&#8208;A) motifs, TCzPhCor, TDMACPhCor, and TPXZPhCor, using corannulene as the acceptor and carbazole (Cz), 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;dimethylacridine (DMAC), and phenoxazine (PXZ) as the donor, respectively. By decorating corannulene with different donors, multiple phosphorescence is realized. Theoretical and photophysical investigations reveal that TCzPhCor shows room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from the lowest&#8208;lying T1; however, for TDMACPhCor, dual RTP originating from a higher&#8208;lying T1 (T1H) and a lower&#8208;lying T1 (T1L) can be observed, while for TPXZPhCor, T1H&#8208;dominated RTP occurs resulting from a stabilized high&#8208;energy T1 geometry. Benefiting from the high&#8208;temperature sensitivity of TPXZPhCor, high color&#8208;resolution temperature sensing is achieved. Besides, due to degenerate S1 and T1H states of TPXZPhCor, the first corannulene&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed afterglow OLEDs is investigated. The afterglow OLED with TPXZPhCor shows a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) and a luminance (Lmax) of 3.3&#8201;% and 5167&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, which is one of the most efficient afterglow RTP OLEDs reported to date.

         <title>Correlating Polysulfide Solvation Structure with Electrode Kinetics towards Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polysulfide electrode kinetics regarding the sulfur cathode and the lithium anode are promoted as the solvating power of the polysulfide solvation structure increases. Both too fast and slow electrode kinetics induce rapid failure of Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The polysulfide solvation structure with medium solvating power balances the cathode and anode kinetics and improves the cycling performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are promising due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their cycling lifespan is crucially affected by the electrode kinetics of lithium polysulfides. Herein, the polysulfide solvation structure is correlated with polysulfide electrode kinetics towards long&#8208;cycling Li&#8722;S batteries. The solvation structure derived from strong solvating power electrolyte induces fast anode kinetics and rapid anode failure, while that derived from weak solvating power electrolyte causes sluggish cathode kinetics and rapid capacity loss. By contrast, the solvation structure derived from medium solvating power electrolyte balances cathode and anode kinetics and improves the cycling performance of Li&#8722;S batteries. Li&#8722;S coin cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes and high&#8208;S&#8208;loading cathodes deliver 146 cycles and a 338&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pouch cell undergoes stable 30 cycles. This work clarifies the relationship between polysulfide solvation structure and electrode kinetics and inspires rational electrolyte design for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Engineered Bacteria Labeled with Iridium(III) Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium (III) photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid (Ir&#8208;HEcN) targets the solid tumors and produces reactive oxygen species in situ upon photoirradiation, which induces pyroptosis of tumor cells and spontaneous self&#8208;elimination of Ir&#8208;HEcN. The resulting debris further evokes innate and adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Therefore, Ir&#8208;HEcN&#8208;mediated treatment remarkably eradicates solid tumors via enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
Despite metal&#8208;based photosensitizers showing great potential in photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment, the application of the photosensitizers is intrinsically limited by their poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties. Herein, we reported a metal&#8208;based photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid, Ir&#8208;HEcN, via covalent labeling of an iridium(III) photosensitizer to the surface of genetically engineered bacteria. Due to its intrinsic self&#8208;propelled motility and hypoxia tropism, Ir&#8208;HEcN selectively targets and penetrates deeply into tumor tissues. Importantly, Ir&#8208;HEcN is capable of inducing pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death of tumor cells under irradiation, thereby remarkably evoking anti&#8208;tumor innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo and leading to the regression of solid tumors via combinational photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, Ir&#8208;HEcN is the first metal complex decorated bacteria for enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Dynamic Growth of Macroscopically Structured Supramolecular Hydrogels through Orchestrated Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic growth of structured supramolecular hydrogels has been achieved by a simple reaction&#8208;diffusion strategy, reminiscent of the dynamic structural evolution of living organisms. The dynamic growth of the hydrogel has been well explained by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, which provides a robust approach to program the growth of diverse dynamic hydrogel structures.







Abstract
Living organisms are capable of dynamically changing their structures for adaptive functions through sophisticated reaction&#8208;diffusion processes.

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic growth of structured supramolecular hydrogels has been achieved by a simple reaction-diffusion strategy, reminiscent of the dynamic structural evolution of living organisms. The dynamic growth of the hydrogel has been well explained by a reaction-diffusion model, which provides a robust approach to program the growth of diverse dynamic hydrogel structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living organisms are capable of dynamically changing their structures for adaptive functions through sophisticated reaction-diffusion processes. Here we show how active supramolecular hydrogels with programmable lifetimes and macroscopic structures can be created by relying on a simple reaction-diffusion strategy. Two hydrogel precursors (poly(acrylic acid) PAA/CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) diffuse from different locations and generate amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles at the diffusional fronts, leading to the formation of hydrogel structures driven by electrostatic interactions between PAA and ACC nanoparticles. Interestingly, the formed hydrogels are capable of autonomously disintegrating over time because of a delayed influx of electrostatic-interaction inhibitors (NaCl). The hydrogel growth process is well explained by a reaction-diffusion model which offers a theoretical means to program the dynamic growth of structured hydrogels.

         <title>A Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Chelating Nano&#8208;immunomodulator for Specific and Sensitized Sono&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
A semiconducting iron&#8208;chelated nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SINM) that specifically triggers ferroptosis and M1 macrophage polarization and generates reactive oxygen species upon sono&#8208;irradiation was developed. SINM was applied to the specific and sensitized sono&#8208;metallo&#8208; immunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Sono&#8208;immunotherapy holds great potential for deep tumor inhibition; however, smart sono&#8208;therapeutic agents to simultaneously eliminate &#8216;domestic&#8217; tumor cells and regulate the &#8216;community&#8217; tumor immune microenvironment have rarely been developed. Herein, we report a spatiotemporally controllable semiconducting iron&#8208;chelated nano&#8208;metallomodulator (SINM) for hypersensitive sono&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. SINM consists of a semiconducting polymer (SP) backbone chelating iron ions (Fe3+) with thiophene&#8208;based Schiff base structure, and a hydrophilic side chain. Upon accumulation in tumors after systemic administration, SINM specifically arouses ferroptosis and M1 macrophage polarization due to its response toward the tumor redox environment; meanwhile, the chelation of Fe3+ enhances the sono&#8208;sensitizing effect of SPs, leading to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species for immunogenic cell death. Such combined sonodynamic metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of SINM efficiently ablates deep tumor and spatiotemporally regulates immunophenotypes.

         <title>A Nitro&#8208;Modified Luminescent Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Non&#8208;Contact and High&#8208;Contrast Sensing of Aromatic Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;contact and high&#8208;contrast visible aromatic amine sensing in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported for the first time. Direct observation of host&#8211;guest co&#8208;crystal structures is achieved, revealing a conversion from charge transfer to charge separation assisted by both the stereo molecular core and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions with nitro groups, further making this HOF a multifunctional platform for versatile applications.







Abstract
The global demand for intelligent sensing of aromatic amines has consistently increased due to concerns about health and the environment. Efforts to improve material design and understand mechanisms have been made, but highly efficient non&#8208;contact sensing with host&#8211;guest structures remains a challenge. Herein, we report the first example of non&#8208;contact, high&#8208;contrast sensing of aromatic amines in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on a nitro&#8208;modified stereo building block. Direct observation of binding interactions of trapped amines is achieved, leading to charge separation&#8208;induced emission quenching between host and guests. Non&#8208;contact sensing of aniline and diphenylamine is realized with quenching efficiencies up to 91.7&#8201;% and 97.0&#8201;%, which shows potential for versatile applications. This work provides an inspiring avenue to engineer multifunctional HOFs via co&#8208;crystal preparations, thus enriching applications of porous materials with explicit mechanisms.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Induced Isomerization of Prenucleation Clusters During the Prenucleation Stage of CdTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the prenucleation stage of colloidal semiconductor CdTe quantum dots (QDs), precursor compounds (PCs) of magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) form and isomerize. When the reaction temperature is increased, PC&#8208;371 forms at 25&#8201;&#176;C and isomerizes to PC&#8208;448 at 80&#8201;&#176;C via PC&#8208;417 at 45&#8201;&#176;C. When a prenucleation&#8208;stage sample is placed in a mixture of cyclohexane (CH) and octylamine (OTA), the PCs that have formed transform quickly to their counterpart MSCs.







Abstract
The evolution of prenucleation clusters in the prenucleation stage of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has remained unexplored. With CdTe as a model system, we show that substances form and isomerize prior to the nucleation and growth of QDs. Called precursor compounds (PCs), the prenucleation clusters are relatively optically transparent and can transform to absorbing magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs). When a prenucleation&#8208;stage sample at 25, 45, or 80&#8201;&#176;C is dispersed in a mixture of cyclohexane (CH) and octylamine (OTA) at room temperature, either MSC&#8208;371, MSC&#8208;417, or MSC&#8208;448 evolves with absorption peaking at 371, 417, or 448&#8197;nm, respectively. We propose that PC&#8208;371 forms at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and isomerizes to PC&#8208;417 at 45&#8201;&#176;C and to PC&#8208;448 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The PCs and MSCs are quasi isomers. Relatively large and small amounts of OTA favor PC&#8208;371 and PC&#8208;448 in dispersion, respectively. The present findings suggest the existence of PC&#8208;to&#8208;PC isomerization in the QD prenucleation stage.

         <title>Non&#8208;Doped Blue AIEgen&#8208;Based OLED with EQE Approaching 10.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue AIEgen of DPDPB&#8208;AC was designed by fusing a hot exciton AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC with a triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion luminogen of DMPPP. When it was used as non&#8208;doped EML of organic light&#8208;emitting diode, an outstanding maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional maximum brightness (Lmax) of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were achieved.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are attractive for the construction of non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owning to their high emission efficiency in the film state. However, the large internal inversion rate (kIC(Tn)) between high&#8208;lying triplet levels (Tn) and Tn&#8208;1 causes a huge loss of triplet excitons, resulting in dissatisfied device performance of these AIEgens&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a blue luminogen of DPDPB&#8208;AC by fusing an AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC and a DMPPP, which feature hot exciton and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion process, respectively. DPDPB&#8208;AC successfully inherits the AIE feature and excellent horizontal dipole orientation of TPB&#8208;AC. Furthermore, it owes smaller kIC(Tn) than TPB&#8208;AC. When DPDPB&#8208;AC was applied in OLED as non&#8208;doped emitting layer, an outstanding external quantum efficiency of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional brightness of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were achieved. The transient electroluminescent measurements and steady&#8208;state dynamic analysis confirm that both TTA and hot exciton processes contribute to such excellent device performance. This work provides a new insight into the design of efficient organic fluorophores by managing high&#8208;lying triplet excitons.

Herein, we designed and synthesized a blue luminogen of DPDPB-AC by fusing an AIEgen of TPB-AC and a DMPPP, which feature hot exciton and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) up-conversion process, respectively. DPDPB-AC successfully inherits the AIE feature and excellent horizontal dipole orientation of TPB-AC. Furthermore, it owes smaller &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;(Tn)&lt;/sup&gt; than TPB-AC. When DPDPB-AC was applied in OLED as non-doped emitting layer, an outstanding external quantum efficiency of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional brightness of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; were achieved. The transient electroluminescent measurements and steady-state dynamic analysis confirm that both TTA and hot exciton processes contribute to such excellent device performance. This work provides a new insight into the design of efficient organic fluorophores by managing high-lying triplet excitons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Vicinal Di&#8208;Carbo&#8208;Functionalization of Indoles: Reaction Development and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208; and regioselective vicinal di&#8208;carbo&#8208;functionalization of indoles has been realized by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis. The C1&#8208;substituted NBE plays a key role promoting the turnover&#8208;limiting oxidative addition step.







Abstract
Methods that can simultaneously install multiple different functional groups to heteroarenes via C&#8722;H functionalizations are valuable for complex molecule synthesis, which, however, remain challenging to realize. Here we report the development of vicinal di&#8208;carbo&#8208;functionalization of indoles in a site&#8208; and regioselective manner, enabled by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis. The reaction is initiated by the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C3&#8208;metalation and specifically promoted by the C1&#8208;substituted NBEs. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a good substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The resulting C2&#8208;arylated C3&#8208;alkenylated indoles can be converted to diverse synthetically useful scaffolds. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic study reveals the unique role of the C1&#8208;substituted NBE in accelerating the turnover&#8208;limiting oxidative addition step.

         <title>Degradable and Recyclable Polyesters from Multiple Chain Length Bio&#8208; and Waste&#8208;Sourceable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters derived from multiple chain length dicarboxylate feedstocks, as obtained from valorization of waste polyethylene or oxidation of bio&#8208;based fatty acids, exhibit high density polyethylene&#8208;like properties, are ductile materials processable into films and fibers, and can be depolymerized enabling chemical recycling or biodegradation in the environment.







Abstract
Monomers sourced from waste or biomass are often mixtures of different chain lengths; e.g. catalytic oxidation of polyethylene waste yields mixtures of dicarboxylic acids (DCAs). Yet, polyesters synthesized from such monomer mixtures have rarely been studied. We report polyesters based on multiple linear aliphatic DCAs, present in chain length distributions that vary in their centers and ranges. We demonstrate that these materials can adopt high&#8208;density polyethylene&#8208;like solid state structures, and are ductile (e.g. Et 610&#8197;MPa), allowing for injection molding, or film and fiber extrusion. Melting and crystallization points of the polyesters show no odd&#8208;even effects as dipoles cannot favorably align in the crystal, similar to traditional odd carbon numbered, long&#8208;chain DCA polyesters. Biodegradation studies of 13C&#8208;labelled polyesters in soil reveal rapid mineralization, and depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

         <title>Mechanistic Evidence of a Ni(0/II/III) Cycle for Nickel Photoredox Amide Arylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni(0/II/III) cycle is uncovered for a Ni&#8208;photoredox amide arylation reaction. Identification of a precatalyst&#8208;dependent induction period, together with reactivity studies for catalytic intermediates, were key to discerning the mechanism. These findings contrast with other Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8722;N couplings that proceed via Ni(I/III) cycles, highlighting how small changes in reaction conditions can lead to alternative pathways.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the dominance of a Ni(0/II/III) cycle for Ni&#8208;photoredox amide arylation, which contrasts with other Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8208;heteroatom couplings that operate via Ni(I/III) self&#8208;sustained cycles. The kinetic data gathered when using different Ni precatalysts supports an initial Ni(0)&#8208;mediated oxidative addition into the aryl bromide. Using NiCl2 as the precatalyst resulted in an observable induction period, which was found to arise from a photochemical activation event to generate Ni(0) and to be prolonged by unproductive comproportionation between the Ni(II) precatalyst and the in situ generated Ni(0) active species. Ligand exchange after oxidative addition yields a Ni(II) aryl amido complex, which was identified as the catalyst resting state for the reaction. Stoichiometric experiments showed that oxidation of this Ni(II) aryl amido intermediate was required to yield functionalized amide products. The kinetic data presented supports a rate&#8208;limiting photochemically&#8208;mediated Ni(II/III) oxidation to enable C&#8722;N reductive elimination. An alternative Ni(I/III) self&#8208;sustained manifold was discarded based on EPR and kinetic measurements. The mechanistic insights uncovered herein will inform the community on how subtle changes in Ni&#8208;photoredox reaction conditions may impact the reaction pathway, and have enabled us to include aryl chlorides as coupling partners and to reduce the Ni loading by 20&#8208;fold without any reactivity loss.

         <title>Reversible Solid&#8211;Solid Conversion of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Cathodes in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries by Weakly Solvating Ether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) was formed on the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode by utilizing a weakly solvating ether electrolyte with an anion&#8211;rich solvated structure. This CEI layer effectively impedes the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte, thereby inducing a &#8220;solid&#8211;solid&#8221; direct conversion mechanism. Consequently, the SPAN cathode demonstrates excellent cycle reversibility and achieves an extended lifespan.







Abstract
Despite carbonate electrolytes exhibiting good stability to sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN), their chemical incompatibility with lithium (Li) metal anode leads to poor electrochemical performance of Li||SPAN full cells. While the SPAN employs conventional ether electrolytes that suffer from the shuttle effect, leading to rapid capacity fading. Here, we tailor a dilute electrolyte based on a low solvating power ether solvent that is both compatible with SPAN and Li metal. Unlike conventional ether electrolytes, the weakly solvating ether electrolyte enables SPAN to undergo reversibly &#8220;solid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion. It features an anion&#8211;rich solvation structure that allows for the formation of a robust cathode electrolyte interphase on the SPAN, effectively blocking the dissolution of polysulfides into the bulk electrolyte and avoiding the shuttle effect. What's more, the unique electrolyte chemistry endowed Li ions with fast electroplating kinetics and induced high reversibility Li deposition/stripping process from 25&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Based on tailored electrolyte, Li||SPAN full cells matched with high loading SPAN cathodes (&#8776;3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil can operate stably over a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, Li||SPAN pouch cell under lean electrolyte and 5&#8201;% excess Li conditions can continuously operate stably for over a month.

         <title>Site Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Regulating Peroxymonosulfate Activation to Generate Singlet Oxygen with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By altering the initial adsorption configuration of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and its subsequent bond&#8208;breaking modes, covalent organic frameworks with bipyridine units (BPY&#8208;COFs) switch PMS activation from a radical pathway to the nonradical one with 100&#8201;% singlet oxygen selectivity, achieving impressive degradation performance and high compatibility with water matrices.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for the selective conversion of organic matter, especially in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, due to the huge dilemma in synthesizing single&#8208;site type catalysts, the control and regulation of 1O2 generation in AOPs is still challenging and the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here, taking advantage of the well&#8208;defined and flexibly tunable sites of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we report the first achievement in precisely regulating ROSs generation in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs by site engineering of COFs. Remarkably, COFs with bipyridine units (BPY&#8208;COFs) facilitate PMS activation via a nonradical pathway with 100&#8201;% 1O2, whereas biphenyl&#8208;based COFs (BPD&#8208;COFs) with almost identical structures activate PMS to produce radicals (&#8901;OH and SO4.&#8722;). The BPY&#8208;COFs/PMS system delivers boosted performance for selective degradation of target pollutants from water, which is ca. 9.4 times that of its BPD&#8208;COFs counterpart, surpassing most reported PMS&#8208;based AOPs systems. Mechanism analysis indicated that highly electronegative pyridine&#8208;N atoms on BPY&#8208;COFs provide extra sites to adsorb the terminal H atoms of PMS, resulting in simultaneous adsorption of O and H atoms of PMS on one pyridine ring, which facilitates the cleavage of its S&#8722;O bond to generate 1O2.

The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membranes with sub&#8208;nano&#8208;straight channels effectively inhibit the migration of vanadium ions while accelerating the proton transport, which enables good flow battery performance.







Abstract
Vanadium flow battery (VFB) is one of the most reliable stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage technologies, and a membrane with high vanadium resistance and proton conductivity is essential for manufacturing high&#8208;performance VFBs. In this study, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane was fabricated from zeolite nanosheet modules, which displayed excellent vanadium resistance (0.07&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and proton conductivity (0.16&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), yielding a coulombic efficiency of 93.9&#8201;%, a voltage efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%, and an energy efficiency of 82.3&#8201;% at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The self&#8208;discharge period of a VFB equipped with 2D MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane increased up to 116.2&#8197;h, which was significantly longer than that of the commercial perfluorinated sulfonate membrane (45.9&#8197;h). Furthermore, the corresponding battery performance remained stable over 1000 cycles (&gt;1500&#8197;h) at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These findings demonstrate that 2D MFI&#8208;type membranes are promising ion&#8208;conductive membranes applicable for stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Improved Electrocatalytic Activity and Stability by Single Iridium Atoms on Iron&#8208;based Layered Double Hydroxides for Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>

The complete origin of the catalytic performance of Ir/CoFe&#8208;LDH for OER from the points of view of both the active center and the support is presented.







Abstract
Full understanding to the origin of the catalytic performance of a supported nanocatalyst from the points of view of both the active component and support is significant for the achievement of high performance. Herein, based on a model electrocatalyst of single&#8208;iridium&#8208;atom&#8208;doped iron (Fe)&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (LDH) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we reveal the first completed origin of the catalytic performance of such supported nanocatalysts. Specially, besides the activity enhancement of Ir sites by LDH support, the stability of surface Fe sites is enhanced by doped Ir sites: DFT calculation shows that the Ir sites can reduce the activity and enhance the stability of the nearby Fe sites; while further finite element simulations indicate, the stability enhancement of distant Fe sites could be attributed to the much low concentration of OER reactant (hydroxyl ions, OH&#8722;) around them induced by the much fast consumption of OH&#8722; on highly active Ir sites. These new findings about the interaction between the main active components and supports are applicable in principle to other heterogeneous nanocatalysts and provide a completed understanding to the catalytic performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts.

         <title>A General Strategy Toward pH&#8208;Resistant Phenolic Fluorophores for High&#8208;Fidelity Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the polar and acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH and medium&#8208;dependent emission signals, which complicates bioimaging experimental design and reduces the data reliability. We developed a single&#8208;step functionalization that makes phenolic fluorophores pH and medium&#8208;resistant. The new fluorophores can be used for high&#8208;fidelity sensing and bioimaging applications.







Abstract
Aryl alcohol&#8208;type or phenolic fluorophores offer diverse opportunities for developing bioimaging agents and fluorescence probes. Due to the inherently acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH&#8208;dependent emission signals. Therefore, except for developing pH probes, the pH&#8208;dependent nature of phenolic fluorophores should be considered in bioimaging applications but has been neglected. Here we show that a simple structural remedy converts conventional phenolic fluorophores into pH&#8208;resistant derivatives, which also offer &#8220;medium&#8208;resistant&#8221; emission properties. The structural modification involves a single&#8208;step introduction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor such as morpholine nearby the phenolic hydroxyl group, which also leads to emission bathochromic shift, increased Stokes shift, enhanced photo&#8208;stability and stronger emission for several dyes. The strategy greatly expands the current fluorophores&#8217; repertoire for reliable bioimaging applications, as demonstrated here with ratiometric imaging of cells and tissues.

         <title>Engineered Biocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase was engineered for efficient N&#8208;alkylation to access densely functionalized non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Mechanistic analysis guided preparative scale synthesis, adding a valuable new enzyme to the biocatalytic toolbox.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are useful synthons for the development of new medicines, materials, and probes for bioactivity. Recently, enzyme engineering has been leveraged to produce a suite of highly active enzymes for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted amino acids. However, there are few examples of biocatalytic N&#8208;substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino acids. In this study, we used directed evolution to engineer the &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of l&#8208;serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;&#8208;substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a gram scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are useful synthons for the development of new medicines, materials, and probes for bioactivity. Recently, enzyme engineering has been leveraged to produce a suite of highly active enzymes for the synthesis of &#946;-substituted amino acids. However, there are few examples of biocatalytic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;-diamino acids. In this study, we used directed evolution to engineer the &#946;-subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re-entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;-substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a gram scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Ultrathin &#960;&#8208;complexation MOF Membrane for Ethylene/Ethane and Flue Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>

A multi&#8208;scale structure optimization strategy gives an oriented ultrathin NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane chelated with coordinatively unsaturated Cu ions. Cu ions act as coordinating modulator and recognition sites, enabling the formation of ultrathin nanosheets and membranes. They also promote &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions with C2H4 and CO2, leading to enhanced performance for ethylene/ethane and flue gas separations.







Abstract
Rational design and engineering of high&#8208;performance molecular sieve membranes towards C2H4/C2H6 and flue gas separations remain a grand challenge to date. In this study, through combining pore micro&#8208;environment engineering with meso&#8208;structure manipulation, highly c&#8208;oriented sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm&#8208;thick Cu@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 membrane was successfully prepared. Coordinatively unsaturated Cu ions immobilized in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 framework enabled high&#8208;affinity &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions with C2H4, resulting in an C2H4/C2H6 selectivity approaching 13.6, which was 9.4&#8197;times higher than that of pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 membrane; moreover, benefiting from &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between CO2 and Cu(I) sites, our membrane displayed superior CO2/N2 selectivity of 43.2 with CO2 permeance of 696 GPU, which far surpassed the benchmark of other pure MOF membranes. The above multi&#8208;scale structure optimization strategy is anticipated to present opportunities for significantly enhancing the separation performance of diverse molecular sieve membranes.

         <title>Interfacial Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Selenide Nanomembrane for Enantiospecific Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanomembranes were assembled from chiral selenium nanoparticles. The D&#8208;nanomembrane exhibited a photocurrent for L&#8208;kynurenine (L&#8208;Kyn) with a limit of detection of 0.0074&#8197;nM for L&#8208;Kyn, which could be applied to distinguish L&#8208;Kyn in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Alzheimer's disease patients.







Abstract
Here, we report the synthesis of chiral selenium nanoparticles (NPs) using cysteine and the interfacial assembly strategy to generate a self&#8208;assembled nanomembrane on a large&#8208;scale with controllable morphology and handedness. The selenide (Se) NPs exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the ultraviolet and visible region with a maximum intensity of 39.96&#8197;mdeg at 388&#8197;nm and optical anisotropy factors (g&#8208;factors) of up to 0.0013 while a self&#8208;assembled monolayer nanomembrane exhibited symmetrical CD approaching 72.8&#8197;mdeg at 391&#8197;nm and g&#8208;factors up to 0.0034. Analysis showed that a photocurrent of 20.97&#177;1.55&#8197;nA was generated by the D&#8208;nanomembrane when irradiated under light while the L&#8208;nanomembrane generated a photocurrent of 20.58&#177;1.36&#8197;nA. Owing to the asymmetric intensity of the photocurrent with respect to the handedness of the nanomembrane, an ultrasensitive recognition of enantioselective kynurenine (Kyn) was achieved by the ten&#8208;layer (10L) D&#8208;nanomembrane exhibiting a photocurrent for L&#8208;kynurenine (L&#8208;Kyn) that was 8.64&#8208;fold lower than that of D&#8208;Kyn, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0074&#8197;nM for the L&#8208;Kyn, which was attributed to stronger affinity between L&#8208;Kyn and D&#8208;Se NPs. Noticeably, the chiral Se nanomembrane precisely distinguished L&#8208;Kyn in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy subjects.

         <title>First&#8208;Row d6 Metal Complex Enables Photon Upconversion and Initiates Blue Light&#8208;Dependent Polymerization with Red Light</title>

A chromium(0) complex with a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) excited state sensitizes red&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with 9,10&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl) anthracene, performing upconversion with an efficiency of 1.8&#177;0.2&#8201;% and a pseudo anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.88&#8197;eV. Driven by the blue upconversion luminescence, polymerization of acrylamide is initiated with red light.







Abstract
Photosensitizers for sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) often rely on precious heavy metals, whereas coordination complexes based on abundant first&#8208;row transition metals are less common. This is mainly because long&#8208;lived triplet excited states are more difficult to obtain for 3d metals, particularly when the d&#8208;subshell is only partially filled. Here, we report the first example of sTTA&#8208;UC based on a 3d6 metal photosensitizer yielding an upconversion performance competitive with precious metal&#8208;based analogues. Using a newly developed Cr0 photosensitizer featuring equally good photophysical properties as an OsII benchmark complex in combination with an acetylene&#8208;decorated anthracene annihilator, red&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion is achievable. The upconversion efficiency under optimized conditions is 1.8&#8201;%, and the excitation power density threshold to reach the strong annihilation limit is 5.9&#8197;W/cm2. These performance factors, along with high photostability, permit the initiation of acrylamide polymerization by red light, based on radiative energy transfer between delayed annihilator fluorescence and a blue light absorbing photo&#8208;initiator. Our study provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for photon upconversion with elusive first&#8208;row analogues of widely employed precious d6 metal photosensitizers, and for their application in photochemical reactions triggered by excitation wavelengths close to near&#8208;infrared.

         <title>A Solution&#8208;Processable Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Photoelectrochemical Sensing of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitive and highly conductive 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded porphyrin framework (FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2) has been constructed with large surface areas, controllable thicknesses, and high area to thickness ratios. A label&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on a screen&#8208;printed electrode with deposited FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 was fabricated that exhibits excellent selectivity, extremely low detection limit (2.3&#8197;ppm), and long&#8208;term working stability (&gt;30&#8197;days) for CO2.







Abstract
Detecting CO2 in complex gas mixtures is challenging due to the presence of competitive gases in the ambient atmosphere. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques offer a solution, but material selection and specificity remain limiting. Here, we constructed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework material based on a porphyrin tecton decorated with diaminotriazine (DAT) moieties. The DAT moieties on the porphyrin molecules not only facilitate the formation of complementary hydrogen bonds between the tectons but also function as recognition sites in the resulting porous HOF materials for the selective adsorption of CO2. In addition, the in&#8208;plane growth of FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 into anisotropic molecular sheets with large areas of up to 23000&#8197;&#956;m2 and controllable thickness between 0.298 and 2.407&#8197;&#956;m were realized in yields of over 89&#8201;% by a simple solution&#8208;processing method. The FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 can be directly grown and deposited onto different substrates including silica, carbon, and metal oxides by self&#8208;assembly in situ in formic acid. As a proof of concept, a screen&#8208;printing electrode deposited with FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 was fabricate as a label&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for CO2 detection. Such a signal&#8208;off PEC sensor exhibits low detection limit for CO2 (2.3&#8197;ppm), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30&#8197;days).

&lt;p&gt;A photosensitive and highly conductive 2D hydrogen-bonded porphyrin framework (FDU-HOF-2) has been constructed with large surface areas, controllable thicknesses, and high area to thickness ratios. A label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on a screen-printed electrode with deposited FDU-HOF-2 was fabricated that exhibits excellent selectivity, extremely low detection limit (2.3&#8197;ppm), and long-term working stability (&amp;gt;30&#8197;days) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in complex gas mixtures is challenging due to the presence of competitive gases in the ambient atmosphere. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques offer a solution, but material selection and specificity remain limiting. Here, we constructed a hydrogen-bonded organic framework material based on a porphyrin tecton decorated with diaminotriazine (DAT) moieties. The DAT moieties on the porphyrin molecules not only facilitate the formation of complementary hydrogen bonds between the tectons but also function as recognition sites in the resulting porous HOF materials for the selective adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, the in-plane growth of FDU-HOF-2 into anisotropic molecular sheets with large areas of up to 23000&#8197;&#956;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and controllable thickness between 0.298 and 2.407&#8197;&#956;m were realized in yields of over 89&#8201;% by a simple solution-processing method. The FDU-HOF-2 can be directly grown and deposited onto different substrates including silica, carbon, and metal oxides by self-assembly in situ in formic acid. As a proof of concept, a screen-printing electrode deposited with FDU-HOF-2 was fabricate as a label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; detection. Such a signal-off PEC sensor exhibits low detection limit for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.3&#8197;ppm), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long-term working stability (at least 30&#8197;days).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Methylation Approach to Salt&#8208;Concentrated Hydrogel Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation modification of polymer skeletons releases hydrogen bond acceptors as Lewis base sites to assist salt dissolution, which enables a salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte and addresses water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in developing flexible and safe batteries, but the presence of free solvent water makes battery chemistries constrained by H2 evolution and electrode dissolution. Although maximizing salt concentration is recognized as an effective strategy to reduce water activity, the protic polymer matrices in classical hydrogels are occupied with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and barely involved in the salt dissolution, which sets limitations on realizing stable salt&#8208;concentrated environments before polymer&#8208;salt phase separation occurs. Inspired by the role of protein methylation in regulating intracellular phase separation, here we transform the &#8220;inert&#8221; protic polymer skeletons into aprotic ones through methylation modification to weaken the hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which releases free hydrogen bond acceptors as Lewis base sites to participate in cation solvation and thus assist salt dissolution. An unconventionally salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte reaching a salt fraction up to 44&#8197;mol&#8201;% while retaining a high Na+/H2O molar ratio of 1.0 is achieved without phase separation. Almost all water molecules are confined in the solvation shell of Na+ with depressed activity and mobility, which addresses water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions that limit the practical rechargeability of aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The assembled Na3V2(PO4)3//NaTi2(PO4)3 cell maintains 82.8&#8201;% capacity after 580 cycles, which is the longest cycle life reported to date.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Microcapsules Harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 Immune Response for Cancer Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vector&#8208;functionalized lentivirus&#8208;loaded DNA tetrahedra&#8208;modified stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogel microcapsules act as active carriers for gene expression in cancer cells and immunogenetic therapy of cancer cells. This is exemplified by designing Alpha&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP)&#8208;aptamer or miRNA&#8208;responsive carriers, expressing green fluorescence protein and the AFP&#8208;stimulated expression of the spike protein, harnessing the COVID&#8208;19 immune response for cancer therapy.







Abstract
The combination of gene therapy and immunotherapy concepts, along recent advances in DNA nanotechnology, have the potential to provide important tools for cancer therapies. We present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive microcapsules, loaded with a viral immunogenetic agent, harnessing the immune response against the Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID&#8208;19, to selectively attack liver cancer cells (hepatoma) or recognize breast cancer or hepatoma, by expression of green fluorescence protein, GFP. The pH&#8208;responsive microcapsules, modified with DNA&#8208;tetrahedra nanostructures, increased hepatoma permeation by 50&#8201;%. Incorporation of a GFP&#8208;encoding lentivirus vector inside the tumor&#8208;targeting pH&#8208;stimulated miRNA&#8208;triggered and Alpha&#8208;fetoprotein&#8208;dictated microcapsules enables the demonstration of neoplasm selectivity, with approximately 5,000&#8208;, 8,000&#8208; and 50,000&#8208;fold more expression in the cancerous cells, respectively. The incorporation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in the gene vector promotes specific recognition of the immune&#8208;evading hepatoma by the COVID&#8208;19&#8208;analogous immune response, which leads to cytotoxic and inflammatory activity, mediated by serum components taken from vaccinated or recovered COVID&#8208;19 patients, resulting in effective elimination of the hepatoma (&gt;85&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Active Sites Decorated Nonpolar Pore&#8208;Based MOF for One&#8208;step Acquisition of C2H4 and Recovery of C3H6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the nonpolar pore surfaces with accessible N/O active sites, a new metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB can realize one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 mixtures as well as recovery of C3H6 from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures around room temperature.







Abstract
Herein, a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB with accessible N/O active sites in nonpolar pore surfaces was reported for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6 or C3H6 mixtures as well as recovery of C3H6 from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures. The MOF exhibits the favorable C2H6 and C3H6 uptakes (&gt;100&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K under 100&#8197;kPa) as well as selective adsorption of C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4. The C3H6&#8208; and C2H6&#8208;selective feature were investigated detailedly by experimental tests as well as sorption kinetic studyies. Molecular modelling revealed the multiple interactions between C3H6 or C2H6 molecules and methyl groups as well as triazine rings in pores. Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB not only can directly generate 323.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 15.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of high&#8208;purity (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) C2H4 from C3H6/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, but also provide a large high&#8208;purity (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%) C3H6 recovery capacity of 60.1&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 from C3H6/C2H4 mixtures. More importantly, the high&#8208;purity C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%) and C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) with the productivities of 38.2 and 12.7&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 can be simultaneously obtained from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures through a single adsorption/desorption cycle.

         <title>Defect Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Accelerated Structural Transformation for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>

The fabrication of unsaturated metal sites in MOFs can accelerate the structural transformation to metal oxyhydroxides with abundant oxygen vacancies, which exhibit much higher OER catalytic activity compared with non&#8208;defective MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been increasingly applied in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the surface of MOFs usually undergoes structural transformation to form metal oxyhydroxides to serve as catalytically active sites. However, the controllable regulation of the reconstruction process of MOFs remains as a great challenge. Here we report a defect engineering strategy to facilitate the structural transformation of MOFs to metal oxyhydroxides during OER with enhanced activity. Defective MOFs (denoted as NiFc&#8242;xFc1&#8208;x) with abundant unsaturated metal sites are constructed by mixing ligands of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (Fc&#8242;) and defective ferrocene carboxylic acid (Fc). NiFc&#8242;xFc1&#8208;x series are more prone to be transformed to metal oxyhydroxides compared with the non&#8208;defective MOFs (NiFc&#8242;). Moreover, the as&#8208;formed metal oxyhydroxides derived from defective MOFs contain more oxygen vacancies. NiFc&#8242;Fc grown on nickel foam exhibits excellent OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 213&#8197;mV at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to that of undefective NiFc&#8242;. Experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that the abundant oxygen vacancies in the derived metal oxyhydroxides facilitate the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates on active centers, thus significantly improving the OER activity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Promoted Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage Employing a Reusable Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and robust nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits highly selective C&#8722;C/C=C bond cleavage reactivity in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O) under comparably mild conditions. The present atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N sites can efficiently activate O2 and H2O to generate singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species, which take part selectively in the C&#8722;C bond cleavage and lead to a significant promotion in activity.







Abstract
The development of methods for selective cleavage reactions of thermodynamically stable C&#8722;C/C=C bonds in a green manner is a challenging research field which is largely unexplored. Herein, we present a heterogeneous Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with highly dispersed iron centers that allows for the oxidative C&#8722;C/C=C bond cleavage of amines, secondary alcohols, ketones, and olefins in the presence of air (O2) and water (H2O). Mechanistic studies reveal the presence of water to be essential for the performance of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C system, boosting the product yield from &lt;1&#8201;% to &gt;90&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and control experiments suggest the singlet 1O2 and hydroxide species generated from O2 and H2O, respectively, take selectively part in the C&#8722;C bond cleavage. The broad applicability (&gt;40 examples) even for complex drugs as well as high activity, selectivity, and durability under comparably mild conditions highlight this unique catalytic system.

A new class of versatile cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked octupolar 2D&#8208;polymer framework (Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO) has been explored as both efficient mixed ionic/electronic conductors and metal&#8208;free sulfur evolution catalysts via ethoxylation chemistry, which enables a novel multifunctional separator interlayer to simultaneously tune bidirectional sulfur redox kinetics and Li ion flux for advanced Li&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Here, we for the first time introduce ethoxylation chemistry to develop a new octupolar cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked 2D polymer framework (Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO) capable of acting as efficient mixed electron/ion conductors and metal&#8208;free sulfur evolution catalysts for dual&#8208;promoted Li and S electrochemistry. Our strategy creates a unique interconnected network of strongly&#8208;coupled donor 3&#8208;(acceptor&#8208;core) octupoles in Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO, affording enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, substantial active sites and crowded open channels. This enables Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO as a new versatile separator modifier, which endows the modified separator with superior catalytic activity for sulfur conversion and rapid Li ion conduction with the high Li+ transference number up to 0.94. Thus, the incorporation of Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO can concurrently regulate sulfur redox reactions and Li&#8208;ion flux in Li&#8722;S cells, attaining boosted bidirectional redox kinetics, inhibited polysulfide shuttle and dendrite&#8208;free Li anodes. The Cyano&#8208;OCF&#8208;EO&#8208;involved Li&#8722;S cell is endowed with excellent overall electrochemical performance especially large areal capacity of 7.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at high sulfur loading of 8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies unveil the dominant multi&#8208;promoting effect of the triethoxylation on electron and ion conduction, polysulfide adsorption and catalytic conversion as well as previously&#8208;unexplored &#8722;CN/C&#8722;O dual&#8208;site synergistic effect for enhanced polysulfide adsorption and reduced energy barrier toward Li2S conversion.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 with CeO2 Catalyst for Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling of N2 and CO2 to urea was realized on ceria catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies. The reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments.







Abstract
The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) into urea by photocatalytic reaction under mild conditions is considered to be a more environmentally friendly and promising alternative strategies. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of inert gas on photocatalysts has become the main challenge that hinder the advancement of this technique. Herein, we have successfully established mesoporous CeO2&#8208;x nanorods with adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration by heat treatment in Ar/H2 (90&#8201;%&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%) atmosphere, enhancing the targeted adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 by introducing oxygen vacancies. Particularly, CeO2&#8208;500 (CeO2 nanorods heated treatment at 500&#8201;&#176;C) revealed high photocatalytic activity toward the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for urea synthesis with a remarkable urea yield rate of 15.5&#8197;&#956;g/h. Besides, both aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy were used to research the atomic surface structure of CeO2&#8208;500 at high resolution and to monitor the key intermediate precursors generated. The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments.

&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic coupling of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to urea was realized on ceria catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies. The reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into urea by photocatalytic reaction under mild conditions is considered to be a more environmentally friendly and promising alternative strategies. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of inert gas on photocatalysts has become the main challenge that hinder the advancement of this technique. Herein, we have successfully established mesoporous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods with adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration by heat treatment in Ar/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (90&#8201;%&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%) atmosphere, enhancing the targeted adsorption and activation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by introducing oxygen vacancies. Particularly, CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-500 (CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods heated treatment at 500&#8201;&#176;C) revealed high photocatalytic activity toward the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for urea synthesis with a remarkable urea yield rate of 15.5&#8197;&#956;g/h. Besides, both aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were used to research the atomic surface structure of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-500 at high resolution and to monitor the key intermediate precursors generated. The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments. We hope this work provides important inspiration and guiding significance towards highly efficient photocatalytic synthesis of urea.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Induced Radical&#8208;Radical Heterocoupling Boosts Photodriven Oxidative Esterification of Benzyl Alcohol over Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Encapsulated Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>

A Co@NC catalyst combined the action of localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonance (LSPR) and photothermal conversion to deliver high reaction rates and selectivity for the oxidation of alcohols to esters under base&#8208;free conditions. The catalytic activity increased by a factor of 7.8 compared with that under direct heating.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of alcohols under mild conditions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in the bulk and fine chemical industry, which usually requires environmentally unfriendly oxidants and bases that are difficult to separate. Here, a plasmonic catalyst of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Co nanoparticles (Co@NC) with an excellent catalytic activity towards selective oxidation of alcohols is demonstrated. With light as only energy input, the plasmonic Co@NC catalyst effectively operates via combining action of the localized surface&#8208;plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the photothermal effects to achieve a factor of 7.8&#8197;times improvement compared with the activity of thermocatalysis. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 15.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 is obtained under base&#8208;free conditions, which surpasses all the reported catalytic performances of thermocatalytic analogues in the literature. Detailed characterization reveals that the d states of metallic Co gain the absorbed light energy, so the excitation of interband d&#8208;to&#8208;s transitions generates energetic electrons. LSPR&#8208;mediated charge injection to the Co@NC surface activates molecular oxygen and alcohol molecules adsorbed on its surface to generate the corresponding radical species (e.g., &#8901;O2&#8722;, CH3O&#8901; and R&#8208;&#8901;CH&#8208;OH). The formation of multi&#8208;type radical species creates a direct and forward pathway of oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol to speed up the production of esters.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Cobalt/Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysts for Synergistically Boosting Hydrogen Generation from Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed N&#8208;coordinated Co/Cu dual&#8208;metal sites were designed and constructed for improved dehydrogenation of formic acid. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the Co/Cu dual&#8208;metal sites synergistically improve the performance of the optimized catalytic system. The presented work describes catalysts based on low&#8208;cost earth abundant dual&#8208;metal sites as promising candidates for H2 storage and delivery.







Abstract
The development of practical materials for (de)hydrogenation reactions is a prerequisite for the launch of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, we present the design and construction of an atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal site Co/Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst allowing significantly improved dehydrogenation of formic acid, which is available from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. The active catalyst centers consist of specific CoCuN6 moieties with double&#8208;N&#8208;bridged adjacent metal&#8208;N4 clusters decorated on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support. At optimal conditions the dehydrogenation performance of the nanostructured material (mass activity 77.7&#8197;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) is up to 40&#8197;times higher compared to commercial 5&#8201;% Pd/C. In situ spectroscopic and kinetic isotope effect experiments indicate that Co/Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C promoted formic acid dehydrogenation follows the so&#8208;called formate pathway with the C&#8722;H dissociation of HCOO* as the rate&#8208;determining step. Theoretical calculations reveal that Cu in the CoCuN6 moiety synergistically contributes to the adsorption of intermediate HCOO* and raises the d&#8208;band center of Co to favor HCOO* activation and thereby lower the reaction energy barrier.

Effective C&#8722;Cl bond activation of organic chlorides to achieve C&#8722;C coupling with high yield is highly desired. The photosynthesis of bibenzyl via benzyl chloride homo&#8208;coupling has been achieved using Cu/ZnO, as reported by Junwang Tang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202307907). The picture illustrates the photocatalytic homo&#8208;coupling of benzyl chloride by Cu/ZnO, including major products, bibenzyl and toluene.

Hollow nanoreactors with a hollow multishelled structure and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles are reported by Jian Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307096). The hollow nanoreactors exhibit size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties for small aliphatic and large aromatic substrates in catalytic semihydrogenation reactions. Calculations provide insights into the nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in the energy barrier of substrate adsorption and steric hindrance.

         <title>An Interfacial View of Cation Effects on Electrocatalysis Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identity of alkali metal cations plays a paramount role in tuning the activity and selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and electrochemical reduction of CO2. From the chemical and/or electrostatic interactions with adsorbed intermediates to the redistribution of interfacial water layer and buffering the interfacial pH, cations greatly influence the crucial steps of electrocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte of electrocatalysis systems has been recently introduced as a crucial factor to tailor the kinetics and Faradaic efficiency of many electrocatalytic reactions. In this Minireview, we have summarized the recent advances in the molecular&#8208;level understanding of cation effects on relevant electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) reactions. The discussion covers the effects of electrolyte cations on interfacial electric fields, structural organization of interfacial water molecules, blocking the catalytic active sites, stabilization or destabilization of intermediates, and interfacial pHs. These cation&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena have been reported to impact the performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) of electrochemical reactions collaboratively or independently. We describe that although there is almost a general agreement on the relationship between the size of alkali cations and the activities of HER, OER, and CO2RR, however, the mechanism by which the performance of these electrocatalytic reactions is influenced by alkali metal cations is still in debate.

         <title>Thermal Stability and Outgassing Behaviors of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal stability and outgassing as two critical safety metrics of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are summarized from a chemical perspective. Thermal decomposition of high&#8208;Ni cathodes starts with ion migration, phase transition, and oxygen release, and ends up with electrolyte combustion. Gas evolution originates from the chemical decomposition of surface lithium carbonate residues and electrolytes under the attack of oxygen from the cathode.







Abstract
LiNiO2&#8208;based high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are regarded as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density automotive lithium batteries. Most of the attention thus far has been paid towards addressing their surface and structural instability issues brought by the increase of Ni content (&gt;90&#8201;%) with an aim to enhance the cycle stability. However, the poor safety performance remains an intractable problem for their commercialization in the market, yet it has not received appropriate attention. In this review, we focus on the gas generation and thermal degradation behaviors of high&#8208;Ni cathodes, which are critical factors in determining their overall safety performance. A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of outgassing and thermal runaway reactions is presented and analyzed from a chemistry perspective. Finally, we discuss the challenges and the insights into developing robust, safe high&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Designs of Tandem Catalysts and Cascade Catalytic Systems for CO2 Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the design principles and development of tandem catalysts for CO2 upgrading to C2+ chemicals by CO2RR, as well as the cascade catalytic systems to tandem&#8208;utilize the C2+ products from CO2RR and achieve their subsequent conversion to higher order compounds. The current challenges in cascade CO2RR systems are discussed and potential approaches for future developments are outlined.







Abstract
Upgrading CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds through the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a practical approach to mitigate atmospheric CO2 while simultaneously producing high value chemicals. The reaction pathways for C2+ production involve multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and C&#8722;C coupling processes. By increasing the surface coverage of adsorbed protons (*Had) and *CO intermediates, the reaction kinetics of PCET and C&#8722;C coupling can be accelerated, thereby promoting C2+ production. However, *Had and *CO are competitively adsorbed intermediates on monocomponent catalysts, making it difficult to break the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of the *Had/*CO intermediate. Recently, tandem catalysts consisting of multicomponents have been developed to improve the surface coverage of *Had or *CO by enhancing water dissociation or CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO production on auxiliary sites. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles of tandem catalysts based on reaction pathways for C2+ products. Moreover, the development of cascade CO2RR catalytic systems that integrate CO2RR with downstream catalysis has expanded the range of potential CO2 upgrading products. Therefore, we also discuss recent advancements in cascade CO2RR catalytic systems, highlighting the challenges and perspectives in these systems.

         <title>Dynamic Cages&#8212;Towards Nanostructured Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given their chemical and structural variability, dynamic organic and coordination cage architectures are increasingly being used in the formation of more complex systems&#8212;smart materials. In this Review we present basic know&#8208;how for modifying active surfaces with cage systems. The structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the cage used and the potential application of the obtained systems are also discussed.







Abstract
The interest in capsular assemblies such as dynamic organic and coordination cages has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural variability, these systems have found applications in diverse fields of research, including energy conversion and storage, catalysis, separation, molecular recognition, and live&#8208;cell imaging. In the exploration of the potential of these discrete architectures, they are increasingly being employed in the formation of more complex systems and smart materials. This Review highlights the most promising pathways to overcome common drawbacks of cage systems (stability, recovery) and discusses the most promising strategies for their hybridization with systems featuring various dimensionalities. Following the description of the most recent advances in the fabrication of zero to three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;based systems, this Review will provide the reader with the structure&#8208;dependent relationship between the employed cages and the properties of the materials.

         <dc:description>
This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of various carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, focusing on recent advances and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Besides, the dual&#8208;ion batteries, conversion&#8208;type K&#8722;X (X=O2, CO2, S, Se, I2) batteries and K&#8208;metal anodes employing carbon materials are also discussed. Based on these situations, we aim to bridge the gaps between various carbon&#8208;based functional materials structure and the related potassium&#8208;ion storage performance.







Abstract
Tremendous progress has been made in the field of electrochemical energy storage devices that rely on potassium&#8208;ions as charge carriers due to their abundant resources and excellent ion transport properties. Nevertheless, future practical developments not only count on advanced electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance, but also on competitive costs of electrodes for scalable production. In the past few decades, advanced carbon materials have attracted great interest due to their low cost, high selectivity, and structural suitability and have been widely investigated as functional materials for potassium&#8208;ion storage. This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly developing field, focusing on recent advanced and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, we also discuss recent achievements of dual&#8208;ion batteries and conversion&#8208;type K&#8722;X (X=O2, CO2, S, Se, I2) batteries towards potential practical applications as high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;power devices, and summarize carbon&#8208;based materials as the host for K&#8208;metal protection and possible directions for the development of potassium energy&#8208;related devices as well. Based on this, we bridge the gaps between various carbon&#8208;based functional materials structure and the related potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, especially provide guidance on carbon material design principles for next&#8208;generation potassium&#8208;ion storage devices.

         <title>Evading the Illusions: Identification of False Peaks in Micro&#8208;Raman Spectroscopy and Guidelines for Scientific Best Practice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>

Raman spectroscopy is a great analysis tool but the spectra are sometimes difficult to interpret due to the occurrence of spectral artefacts. This paper dives into the details of many spurious signals and spectral artefacts that occur in Raman spectra, explains their origin, and provides the tools to identify and avoid them.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;Raman spectroscopy is an important analytical tool in a large variety of science disciplines. The technique is suitable for both identification of chemical bonds and studying more detailed phenomena like molecular interactions, material strain, crystallinity, defects, and bond formations. Raman scattering has one major weakness however: it is a very low probability process. The weak signals require very sensitive detection systems, which leads to a high probability of picking up signals from origins other than the sample. This complicates the analysis of the results and increases the risk of misinterpreting data. This work provides an overview of the sources of spurious signals occurring in Raman spectra, including photoluminescence, cosmic rays, stray light, artefacts caused by spectrometer components, and signals from other compounds in or surrounding the sample. The origins of these false Raman peaks are explained and means to identify and counteract them are provided.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of the First Sex&#8208;Inducing Pheromone of a Diatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing sex pheromone was elucidated using metabolomics, labeling experiments, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The peptide pheromone is active below femtomolar concentrations and synchronizes sexuality in the diatom Seminavis robusta.







Abstract
Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae, responsible for &#8776;20&#8201;% of global photosynthetic CO2 fixation. Nevertheless, we know little about fundamental aspects of their biology, such as their sexual reproduction. Pheromone&#8208;mediated chemical communication is crucial for successful mating. An attraction pheromone was identified in the diatom Seminavis robusta, but metabolites priming cells for sex and synchronizing search and mating behavior remained elusive. These sex&#8208;inducing pheromones (SIP) induce cell cycle arrest and trigger the production of the attraction pheromone. Here we describe the challenging structure elucidation of an S. robusta SIP. Guided by metabolomics, a candidate metabolite was identified and elucidated by labeling experiments, NMR, ESI MSn analyses, and chemical transformations. The use of negative ion mode MS was essential to decipher the unprecedented hydroxyproline and &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing cyclic heptapeptide that acts in femtomolar concentrations.

&lt;p&gt;Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae, responsible for &#8776;20&#8201;% of global photosynthetic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation. Nevertheless, we know little about fundamental aspects of their biology, such as their sexual reproduction. Pheromone-mediated chemical communication is crucial for successful mating. An attraction pheromone was identified in the diatom &lt;i&gt;Seminavis robusta&lt;/i&gt;, but metabolites priming cells for sex and synchronizing search and mating behavior remained elusive. These sex-inducing pheromones (SIP) induce cell cycle arrest and trigger the production of the attraction pheromone. Here we describe the challenging structure elucidation of an &lt;i&gt;S. robusta&lt;/i&gt; SIP. Guided by metabolomics, a candidate metabolite was identified and elucidated by labeling experiments, NMR, ESI MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; analyses, and chemical transformations. The use of negative ion mode MS was essential to decipher the unprecedented hydroxyproline and &#946;-sulfated aspartate-containing cyclic heptapeptide that acts in femtomolar concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trimethylsilyl Chloride Aids in Solubilization of Oxidative Addition Intermediates from Zinc Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widely used activating agent for metal powders, trimethylsilyl chloride, creates an efficient synthesis of organometallic reagents by increasing their solubility. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is developed to provide molecular fingerprints that characterize intermediates and products, enabling mechanistic determination.







Abstract
Trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) is commonly used to &#8220;activate&#8221; metal(0) powders toward oxidative addition of organohalides, but knowledge of its mechanism remains limited by the inability to characterize chemical intermediates under reaction conditions. Here, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) overcomes these prior limitations and shows that TMSCl aids in solubilization of the organozinc intermediate from zinc(0) metal after oxidative addition, a previously unknown mechanistic role. This mechanistic role is in contrast to previously known roles for TMSCl before the oxidative addition step. To achieve this understanding, FLIM, a tool traditionally used in biology, is developed to characterize intermediates during a chemical reaction&#8212;thus revealing mechanistic steps that are unobservable without fluorescence lifetime data. These findings impact organometallic reagent synthesis and catalysis by providing a previously uncharacterized mechanistic role for a widely used activating agent, an understanding of which is suitable for revising activation models and for developing strategies to activate currently unreactive metals.

         <title>Proteomics&#8208;Based Discovery of First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Chemical Probes for Programmed Cell Death Protein 2 (PDCD2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;in&#8208;class programmed cell death protein 2 (PDCD2) degrader, 10&#8201;e, was developed by combination of mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics with a concise structure&#8208;degradation relationship campaign. Our work provides valuable tool compounds for PDCD2 to the scientific community and highlights that combination of proteomics technology with chemical optimization can be a powerful approach and a useful supplement for chemical probes discovery.







Abstract
Chemical probes are essential tools for understanding biological systems and for credentialing potential biomedical targets. Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) is a member of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl&#8208;2) family of proteins, which are critical regulators of apoptosis. Here we report the discovery and characterization of 10&#8201;e, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule degrader of PDCD2. We discovered this PDCD2 degrader by serendipity using a chemical proteomics approach, in contrast to the conventional approach for making bivalent degraders starting from a known binding ligand targeting the protein of interest. Using 10&#8201;e as a pharmacological probe, we demonstrate that PDCD2 functions as a critical regulator of cell growth by modulating the progression of the cell cycle in T lymphoblasts. Our work provides a useful pharmacological probe for investigating PDCD2 function and highlights the use of chemical proteomics to discover selective small molecule degraders of unanticipated targets.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sodium single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) enables high rate capability and stable cycling of Na&#8214;Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% and a capacity retention of more than 84&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered a potential alternative to high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high reactivity of metallic sodium towards common liquid organic electrolytes renders such battery technology particularly challenging. Herein, we propose a multi&#8208;block single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte (SIPE) doped with ethylene carbonate as suitable electrolyte system for SMBs. This novel SIPE provides a very high ionic conductivity (2.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and an electrochemical stability window of about 4.1&#8197;V at 40&#8201;&#176;C, enabling stable sodium stripping and plating and excellent rate capability of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells up to 2&#8197;C. Remarkably, such cells provide a capacity retention of about 85&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C thanks to the very high Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%), resulting from an excellent interfacial stability towards sodium metal and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.

         <title>An Anion&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Function Rotaxane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;controllable rotaxane catalyst has been generated that can selectively catalyze the reaction between trans&#8208;cinnamaldehyde and an aliphatic thiol. The reaction occurs through either a Michael addition or thioacetalation pathway by exposing its dibenzylammonium or imidazolium station, respectively, to the reactants in its two switchable states.







Abstract
In situ switching of the associated anions of a rotaxane catalyst between Cl&#8722; and TFPB&#8722; exposes its dialkylammonium and imidazolium stations, respectively, thereby selectively catalyzing the reactions of a mixture of trans&#8208;cinnamaldehyde and an aliphatic thiol to yield the Michael adduct and the thioacetal product, respectively.

The site&#8208; and E&#8208;selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes over (pseudo)halogens (C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;F, C&#8722;OTf, C&#8722;OSO2F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives is reported. This unprecedented [Ge]&#8208;based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed and under air&#8208;tolerant and base&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Reported herein is a fully orthogonal olefination, which involves the site&#8208; and E&#8208;selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes, tolerating otherwise widely employed coupling handles such as aromatic (pseudo)halogens (C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;F, C&#8722;OTf, C&#8722;OSO2F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives as well as alternative functionalities. This unprecedented [Ge]&#8208;based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed (10&#8197;min to 2&#8197;hours) and operational simplicity owing to its base&#8208;free and air&#8208;tolerant features.

&lt;p&gt;The site- and E-selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes over (pseudo)halogens (C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;F, C&#8722;OTf, C&#8722;OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives is reported. This unprecedented [Ge]-based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed and under air-tolerant and base-free conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is a fully orthogonal olefination, which involves the site- and E-selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes, tolerating otherwise widely employed coupling handles such as aromatic (pseudo)halogens (C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl, C&#8722;F, C&#8722;OTf, C&#8722;OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives as well as alternative functionalities. This unprecedented [Ge]-based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed (10&#8197;min to 2&#8197;hours) and operational simplicity owing to its base-free and air-tolerant features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Four&#8208;Electron Oxidative Addition of an N=N Double Bond at a Chromium Metallocyclopropene

This report describes the synthesis of a chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand. This compound features an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation, exposure of which to an azobenzene derivative leads to a rare 4&#8208;electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond across a single chromium center.







Abstract
This report describes the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand and its reactivity with an azobenzene derivative. Characterization of the former by structural and computational methods reveals an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation by a formal chromium(II) center, suggesting that this complex is best described as a chromium(IV)&#8208;metallocyclopropene. Exposure of this compound to 4,4&#8242;&#8208;difluoroazobenzene results in the formation of a chromium(VI) diimido complex, which constitutes a rare 4&#8208;electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond. The isolation of a chromium(IV)&#8208;hydrazido intermediate enabled mechanistic investigations of this challenging bond cleavage process. This work substantiates the notion that terminal phosphinimide ligands can engender first&#8208;row transition metal ions with exceptional reactivity.

         <title>Motorized Photomodulator: Making A Non&#8208;photoresponsive Supramolecular Gel Switchable by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a molecular motor as a photoswitchable cross&#8208;linker that co&#8208;assembles with a non&#8208;photoresponsive gelator enables reversible control over gel and solution states. This has led to a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system that has the ability to respond to light irradiation, with creation of a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition.







Abstract
Introducing photo&#8208;responsive molecules offers an attractive approach for remote and selective control and dynamic manipulation of material properties. However, it remains highly challenging how to use a minimal amount of photo&#8208;responsive units to optically modulate materials that are inherently inert to light irradiation. Here we show the application of a light&#8208;driven rotary molecular motor as a &#8220;motorized photo&#8208;modulator&#8221; to endow a typical H&#8208;bond&#8208;based gel system with the ability to respond to light irradiation and create a reversible sol&#8208;gel transition. The key molecular design feature is the introduction of a minimal amount (2&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of molecular motors into the supramolecular network as photo&#8208;switchable non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers. Advantage is taken of the subtle interplay of the large geometry change during photo&#8208;isomerization of the molecular motor guest and the dynamic nature of a supramolecular gel host system. As a result, a tiny amount of molecular motors is enough to switch the mechanical modulus of the entire supramolecular systems. This study proves the concept of designing photo&#8208;responsive materials with minimum use of non&#8208;covalent light&#8208;absorbing units.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Electrophile C&#8722;PIII Coupling of Chlorophosphines with Organic Halides: Photoinduced PIII and Aminoalkyl Radical Generation Enabled by Pnictogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon irradiation with visible light, neutral pnictogen bonding (PnB) enables single electron transfer (SET) from alkyl amines to chlorophosphines. This process generates PIII radicals and aminoalkyl radicals. Subsequently, the aminoalkyl radicals activate C&#8722;X bonds through halogen atom transfer (XAT). As a result, cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;PIII coupling between chlorophosphines and organic halides is achieved.







Abstract
Pnictogen bonding (PnB) has gained recognition as an appealing strategy for constructing novel architectures and unlocking new properties. Within the synthetic community, the development of a straightforward and much simpler protocol for cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;PIII coupling remains an ongoing challenge with organic halides. In this study, we present a simple strategy for photoinduced PnB&#8208;enabled cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;PIII couplings using readily available chlorophosphines and organic halides via merging single electron transfer (SET) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) processes. In this photomediated transformation, the PnB formed between chlorophosphines and alkyl amines facilitates the photogeneration of PIII radicals and &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals through SET. Subsequently, the resulting &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals activate C&#8722;X bonds via XAT, leading to the formation of carbon radicals. This methodology offers operational simplicity and compatibility with both aliphatic and aromatic chlorophosphines and organic halides.

         <title>Manganese Transfer Hydrogenases Based on the Biotin&#8208;Streptavidin Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient Mn artificial transfer hydrogenases (ATHases) were developed using the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology, which exhibits high activity and enantioselectivity for the transfer hydrogenation of a wide range of aryl ketones. The S112Y&#8208;K121&#8197;M double mutation and the appropriate chemical structure of the Mn cofactor play critical roles in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the enzymes.







Abstract
Artificial (transfer) hydrogenases have been developed for organic synthesis, but they rely on precious metals. Native hydrogenases use Earth&#8208;abundant metals, but these cannot be applied for organic synthesis due, in part, to their substrate specificity. Herein, we report the design and development of manganese transfer hydrogenases based on the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology. By incorporating bio&#8208;mimetic Mn(I) complexes into the binding cavity of streptavidin, and through chemo&#8208;genetic optimization, we have obtained artificial enzymes that hydrogenate ketones with nearly quantitative yield and up to 98&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). These enzymes exhibit broad substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group tolerance. According to QM/MM calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography, the S112Y mutation, combined with the appropriate chemical structure of the Mn cofactor plays a critical role in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the artificial metalloenzyme (ArMs). Our work highlights the potential of ArMs incorporating base&#8208;meal cofactors for enantioselective organic synthesis.

         <title>Merging Manganese and Iminium Catalysis: Selective Hydroalkenylation of Unsaturated Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones has been accomplished via synergistic HOMO and LUMO activation by means of manganese and iminium catalysis. The use of chiral organocatalysts could provide the corresponding products with moderate enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The use of synergistic catalytic strategy can usually circumvent the intrinsic limitations of one catalytic system.

     alt="Merging Manganese and Iminium Catalysis: Selective Hydroalkenylation of Unsaturated Aldehydes and Ketones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones has been accomplished via synergistic HOMO and LUMO activation by means of manganese and iminium catalysis. The use of chiral organocatalysts could provide the corresponding products with moderate enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of synergistic catalytic strategy can usually circumvent the intrinsic limitations of one catalytic system. In this communication, we disclose a cooperative catalysis strategy of manganese and iminium catalysis to realize selective hydroalkenylation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Its success stems from the LUMO activation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds with secondary amines as the organocatalyst and the synergistic HOMO activation of alkenylboronic acids with Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This protocol exhibits several synthetic advances, e.g., simple operation, good functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. The theoretical calculation indicates the migratory insertion followed by demetallation-isomerization process is kinetically more favorable than Michael-like nucleophilic addition. The use of proline-derived organocatalyst can deliver the desired products in moderate enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphino&#8208;Phosphination Reactions: Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of Phosphino&#8208;Phosphonium Cations with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cations of type [R3PPR&#8242;2]+ were shown to react with alkynes, affording phosphino&#8208;phosphination reactions. Such frustrated Lewis pair reactivity could also provide access to dissymmetric cis&#8208;olefin&#8208;linked bidentate phosphines while avoiding the conventional use of radicals, lithium reagents or transition metal catalysts.







Abstract
The phosphino&#8208;phosphonium cations of the form [R3PPR&#8242;2]+ are labile and provide access to the constituent Lewis acidic and Lewis basic fragments. This permits frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type addition reactions to alkynes, affording unprecedented phosphino&#8208;phosphination reactions and giving cations of the form [cis&#8208;R3PCHC(R&#8242;&#8242;)PR&#8242;2]+. This reactivity is further adapted to prepare several examples of a rare class of dissymmetric cis&#8208;olefin&#8208;linked bidentate phosphines.

         <title>Icosidodecahedral Coordination&#8208;Saturated Cuprofullerene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 43, October 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Judicious selection of coordination ligands has led to the first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with a C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral M30 cluster. Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 in the triple core&#8211;shell cuprofullerene (C60@Cu30@Cl36N12) explains the light absorption up to 700&#8197;nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
The first coordination&#8208;saturated buckyball with a C60 molecule totally encased in an icosidodecahedral Cu30 in a (&#956;30&#8208;(&#951;2)30)&#8208;fashion, namely C60@Cu30@Cl36N12, has been successfully realized by a C60&#8208;templated assembly. The 48 outmost coordinating atoms (36Cl+12N) comprise a new simple polyhedron that is described by a ccf topology. Charge transfer from (CuI, Cl) to C60 explains the expansion of the light absorption up to 700&#8197;nm, and accounts for an ultrafast photophysical process that underpins its high photothermal conversion efficiency. This work makes a giant step forward in exohedral metallofullerene (ExMF) chemistry.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Cyanines: Ultrabright Cyanine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Materials in Solution and Solid States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent materials with high brightness play a crucial role in the advancement of various technologies such as bioimaging, photonics, and OLEDs. While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent materials by addressing long&#8208;standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis&#8211;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Supra&#8208;cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, exhibiting high fluorescence quantum yield (up to 50%) in both solution and solid states. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine&#8208;based supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062 V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757 s&#8208;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Catalytic Insight into the Unique Pentacyclic Triterpene Synthase TwOSC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) catalyzed cyclization of the linear substrate (3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;oxidosqualene to diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) skeletons is one of the most complex reactions in nature. Friedelin has a unique PT skeleton involving a fascinating nine&#8208;step Cation Shuttle&#8208;Run (CSR) cascade arrangement reaction, in which the carbocation formed from C&#8208;2 moves to the other side of the skeleton, runs back to C&#8208;3 to yield a friedelin cation, and finally deprotonated. However, as the data on the crystal structure of plant OSCs are lacking, it remains unknown why the CSR cascade reactions for friedelin biosynthesis and the exact catalytic mechanism of the CSR. In this study, we determined the first cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a plant OSC, friedelin synthase, from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TwOSC). We also performed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to reveal the energy profile for the CSR cascade reaction and identify key residues crucial for PT skeleton yield. Furthermore, we semi&#8208;rationally designed two TwOSC mutants, which significantly improved the yields of friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin, respectively. Our findings provide novel insights into the CSR mechanism under TwOSC enzyme catalysis and propose a new strategy for the semi&#8208;rational design of other OSCs to promote PT biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Clean Synthetic Strategies to Biologically Active Molecules from Lignin: A Green Path to Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deriving active pharmaceutical agents from renewable resources is crucial to increase the economic feasibility of modern biorefineries and promises to alleviate critical supply&#8208;chain dependencies in pharma manufacturing. At the fundamental level, embracing the structural complexity of renewable resources offers hitherto unexploited opportunities for the green synthesis of essential pharmaceuticals, and opens new avenues in drug discovery. In this vein, our multidisciplinary approach combines research in lignin&#8208;first biorefining, sustainable catalysis, and alternative solvents with bioactivity screening, an in vivo efficacy study, and a structural similarity search. The resulting sustainable path to novel anti&#8208;infective, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;cancer molecules enabled the rapid identification of frontrunners for key therapeutic indications. Most significantly, we discovered an anti&#8208;infective against the priority pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, showing efficacy in vivo and promising plasma&#8208; and metabolic stability. Our established chemocatalytic methods, inspired by the innate structural features of lignin, provide straightforward access to synthetically challenging biologically active molecules of the core dopamine structure, namely tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, 3&#8208;arylindoles and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. Our diverse array of atom&#8208;economic transformations produce only harmless side&#8208;products and use benign reaction media, such as tunable deep eutectic solvents for modulating reactivity in challenging cyclization steps.</dc:description>

This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8208;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354).

         <title>Densely Packed CO2 Aids Charge, Spin, and Lattice Ordering Partially Fluctuated in a Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partial charge fluctuations in the charge&#8208;ordered state of a material, often triggered by structural disorders and/or defects, can significantly alter its physical characteristics, such as magnetic long&#8208;range ordering. However, it is difficult to post&#8208;chemically fix such accidental partial fluctuations to reconstruct a uniform charge&#8208;ordered state. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;aided charge ordering demonstrated in a CO2&#8208;post&#8208;captured layered magnet, [{Ru2(o&#8208;ClPhCO2)4}2{TCNQ(OMe)2}]&#183;CO2 (1&#8835;CO2; o&#8208;ClPhCO2&#8722; = ortho&#8208;chlorobenzoate; TNCQ(OMe)2 = 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane). Pristine porous layered magnet 1 had a partially charge&#8208;fluctuated ordered state, which provided ferrimagnetic ordering at TC = 65 K. Upon loading CO2, 1 adsorbed one mole of CO2, forming 1&#8835;CO2, and raising TC to 100 K. This was because of the vanishing charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure. This research illustrates the post&#8208;accessible host&#8208;guest chemistry delicately combined with charge, spin, and lattice ordering in a spongy magnet. Furthermore, it highlights how this innovative approach opens up new possibilities for technology and nanoscale magnetism manipulation.</dc:description>

This was because of the vanishing charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure. This research illustrates the post-accessible host-guest chemistry delicately combined with charge, spin, and lattice ordering in a spongy magnet. Furthermore, it highlights how this innovative approach opens up new possibilities for technology and nanoscale magnetism manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Four&#8208;Electron Reduction of Oxygen by a Nonheme Heterobimetallic CuFe Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;herein the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst ([CuII(bpbp)(&#956;&#8208;OAc)2FeIII]2+, CuFe&#8208;OAc), which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase and can catalyze oxygen reduction to water with a turnover frequency of 2.4 &#215; 103 s&#8208;1 and selectivity of 96.0% in the presence of Et3NH+. This performance significantly outcompetes its homobimetallic analogues (2.7 s&#8208;1 of CuCu&#8208;OAc with %H2O2 selectivity of 98.9%, and inactive of FeFe&#8208;OAc) under the same conditions. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, in combination with density functional theory calculation, show that the CuFe center efficiently mediates O&#8208;O bond cleavage via CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII peroxo intermediate, in which the peroxo ligand possesses distinctive coordinated and electronic characters. Our work sheds light on the nature of Cu/Fe heterobimetallic cooperation in oxygen reduction catalysis and demonstrates the potential of this synergistic effect in the design of nonheme oxygen reduction catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Binding Energy is an Incomplete Descriptor of Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The reliability of the descriptor has yet been experimentally verified due to the lack of suitable methods to determine CO binding energies. In this work, we determined the standard CO adsorption enthalpies ( ) of undoped and doped oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) samples, and for the first time established the correlation of &#160;with the Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for C2+ products. A clear volcano shaped dependence of the FE for C2+ products on &#160;is observed on OD&#8208;Cu catalysts prepared with the same hydrothermal durations, however, the trend becomes less clear when all catalysts investigated are taken into account. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and the further reduction of CO is identified as another key descriptor</dc:description>

         <title>Uniform Colloidal Polymer Rods by Stabilizer&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of anisotropic colloidal building blocks is essential for their self&#8208;assembly into hierarchical materials. Here, a highly efficient stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (SA&#8208;LCDSA) strategy was developed to achieve monodisperse colloidal polymer rods. This strategy does not require the use of block copolymers, but only homopolymers or random copolymers. The resulting rods have tunable size and aspect ratios, as well as well&#8208;defined columnar liquid crystal structures. The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA&#8208;LCDSA&#8208;based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;&#8208;molecular units.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;state 2D NMR spectroscopy of mixtures hyperpolarized&#160;using optically polarized crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The HYPNOESYS method (Hyperpolarized NOE System), which relies on the dissolution of optically polarized crystals, has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy in the solution state. However, HYPNOESYS is a single&#8208;shot method that is not generally compatible with multidimensional NMR. Here we show that 2D NMR spectra can be obtained from&#160;HYPNOESYS&#8208;polarized samples, using single&#8208;scan acquisition methods. The approach is illustrated with a mixture of terpene molecules and a benchtop NMR spectrometer, paving the way to a sensitive, information&#8208;rich and affordable analytical method.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their limited capacity for &#960;&#8208;backdonation, isolation of &#960;&#8208;complexes of main&#8208;group elements remains a great challenge. We report herein the synthesis of a homoleptic diphosphene lead complex (2) from the degradation of P4 with a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized Pb(0) complex. Structural and computational studies showed that 2 possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions between Pb atom and diphosphene ligands, which is reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal diphosphene complexes. Consistent with its unique electronic structure, complex 2 can deliver Pb(0) atoms to perform redox reaction with an iminoquinone to produce a cyclic plumbylene (4) and perform&#160;2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene&#160;(IMe2Me2) induced phosphorus cation abstraction to give an anionic PbP3 complex (6).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inorganic nitrogen oxide&#160; (NOx) species, such as NO, NO2, NO3&#8208;, NO2&#8208; generated from the decomposition of organic matters, volcanic eruptions and lightning activated nitrogen, play important roles in the nitrogen cycle system and exploring the origin of life. Meanwhile, excessive emission of NOx gases and residues from industry and transportation causes troubling problems to the environment and human health. How to efficiently handle these wastes is a global problem. In response to the growing demand for sustainability, scientists are actively pursuing sustainable electrochemical technologies powered by renewable energy sources and efficient utilization of hydrogen energy to convert NOx species into high&#8208;value organonitrogen chemicals. In this minireview, recent advances of electrocatalytic systems for NOx species valorization in organonitrogen synthesis are classified and described, such as amino acids, amide, urea, oximes, nitrile etc., that have been widely applied in medicine, life science and agriculture. Additionally, the current challenges including multiple side reactions and complicated paths, viable solutions along with future directions ahead in this field are also proposed.

         <title>Lewis Acid Supported Nickel Nitrenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalation of the polynucleating ligand F,tbsLH6 (1,3,5&#8208;C6H9(NC6H3&#8208;4&#8208;F&#8208;2&#8208;NSiMe2tBu)3) with two equivalents of Zn(N(SiMe3)2)2 affords the dinuclear product (F,tbsLH2)Zn2 (1), which can be further deprotonated to yield (F,tbsL)Zn2Li2(OEt2)4 (2). Transmetalation of 2 with NiCl2(py)2 yields the heterometallic, trinuclear cluster (F,tbsL)Zn2Nipy (3). Reduction of 3 with KC8 affords [KC222][(F,tbsL)Zn2Ni] (4) which features a monovalent Ni center. Addition of &#8208;adamantyl azide to 4 generates the bridging &#956;3&#8211;nitrenoid adduct [K(THF)3][(F,tbsL)Zn2Ni(&#956;3&#8211;NAd)] (5).

Transmetalation of 2 with NiCl2(py)2 yields the heterometallic, trinuclear cluster (F,tbsL)Zn2Nipy (3).

         <title>Counting d&#8208;Orbital Vacancies of Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts for the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single electronic&#8208;structure descriptor is proposed by linking the d charge for transition metals to the reaction rate for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). This descriptor provides guidelines for the design of catalysts for the SRR as well as various processes and has great promise for driving lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to practical applications.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) would allow the production of renewable high&#8208;capacity rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries using sustainable and nontoxic elemental sulfur as a cathode material, but its slow reaction rate causes a serious shuttle effect and dramatically reduces the capacity. We found that a catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported by ordered mesoporous carbon (Pd/OMC) had a high reaction rate in the SRR, and a Li&#8208;S battery assembled with this catalyst had a low shuttle constant of 0.031&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;rate performance with a specific capacity of 1527&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C which is close to the theoretical value. The high activity of Pd/OMC with a d&#8208;orbital vacancy of 0.87&#8197;e was predicted from a volcano relationship between the d charge for the metal and the adsorption activation entropy and reaction rate for the SRR by examining Pd, Au, Pt, Rh, and Ru transition&#8208;metal nanocatalysts. The strategy of using a single electronic structure descriptor to design high&#8208;efficiency SRR catalysts has suggested a way to produce practical Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8211;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reciprocal stapling of two helices, an aromatic foldamer helix and a peptide &#945;&#8208;helix, was observed in the conformation of a hybrid foldamer&#8211;peptide macrocycle when bound to the protein target against which it was selected. This intriguing shape and the possible contribution of the foldamer to protein binding highlight potential benefits of inserting a foldamer segment in display selection of macrocyclic peptides.







Abstract
Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential to bind biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A foldamer was first identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and that is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8211;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyclic nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.

         <title>Spin Frustration in Organic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin frustration has drawn people's attention for its significance in physics and materials science, especially for quantum spin liquids. Organic radical species show a promising potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated compounds. This Minireview briefly introduces the reported examples of organic radicals that possess spin frustration and summarizes their related data on frustration properties.







Abstract
Spin frustration, which results from geometric frustration and a systematical inability to satisfy all antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between unpaired spins simultaneously, is under the spotlight for its importance in physics and materials science. Spin frustration is treated as the structural basis of quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Featuring flexible chemical structures, organic radical species exhibit great potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated molecules and lattices. So far, the reported examples of spin&#8208;frustrated organic radical compounds include triradicals, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) radicals and derivatives, [Pd(dmit)2] compounds (dmit=1,3&#8208;dithiol&#8208;2&#8208;thione&#8208;4,5&#8208;dithiolate), nitronyl nitroxides, fullerenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other heterocyclic compounds where the spin frustration is generated intra&#8208; or intermolecularly. In this Minireview, we provide a brief summary of the reported radical compounds that possess spin frustration. The related data, including magnetic exchange coupling parameters, spin models, frustration parameters, and crystal lattices, are summarized and discussed.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Plastic Waste Enabled by Plastic&#8208;Catalyst Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer was discovered on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. The construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces by interfacial engineering approaches enables vapor phase depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) at low temperatures with a trace amount of earth abundant metal, Zn.







Abstract
Depolymerization of condensation polymers by chemolysis often suffers from the large usage of solvents and homogeneous catalysts such as acids, bases, and metal salts. The catalytic efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts is largely constrained by the poor interfacial contact between solid catalysts and solid plastics below melting points. We report here our discovery of autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. Inspired by the &#8220;contact mass&#8221; concept in industrial chlorosilane production, we further demonstrate that the construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces enables solvent&#8208;free depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate by vapor phase methanolysis at relatively low temperatures. Trace amounts of earth&#8208;abundant element (zinc) introduced by electrostatic adsorption is sufficient for catalyzing the depolymerization. The concept of plastic&#8208;catalyst contact mass interfacial catalysis might inspire new pathways for tackling plastic waste problems.

         <dc:description>
The promising anti&#8208;diabetic and anti&#8208;cancer drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 in the presence of lysozyme undergoes ligand exchange, partial or complete oxidation of VIV to VV to give two polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V4O12]4&#8722; and the unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722;, based on the unusual [V18O46(NO3)]n&#8722; cage. They are stabilized by non&#8208;covalent or covalent interactions with the protein.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 under two different experimental conditions have been solved. The crystallographic study reveals the loss of the ligands, the oxidation of VIV to VV and the subsequent formation of adducts of the protein with two different polyoxidovanadates: [V4O12]4&#8722;, which interacts with lysozyme non&#8208;covalently, and the unprecedented [V20O54(NO3)]n&#8722;, which is covalenty bound to the side chain of an aspartate residue of symmetry related molecules.

&lt;p&gt;The promising anti-diabetic and anti-cancer drug V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(acetylacetonato)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of lysozyme undergoes ligand exchange, partial or complete oxidation of V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; to V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; to give two polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the unprecedented [V&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, based on the unusual [V&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; cage.

&lt;p&gt;High-resolution crystal structures of lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(acetylacetonato)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under two different experimental conditions have been solved. The crystallographic study reveals the loss of the ligands, the oxidation of V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; to V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; and the subsequent formation of adducts of the protein with two different polyoxidovanadates: [V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which interacts with lysozyme non-covalently, and the unprecedented [V&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is covalenty bound to the side chain of an aspartate residue of symmetry related molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Residual&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Shift&#8208;Anisotropy&#8208;Based Enantiodifferentiation in Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Phases Based on Helically Chiral Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual chemical shift anisotropy can be acquired from enantiomers employing biphasic helically chiral polyacetylene liquid crystal from a single 1D carbon spectrum. The chiral environment of the liquid crystal facilitates diastereomorphous interactions of enantiomers and leads to two different sets of RCSAs. On the basis of two chiral molecules, it has been demonstrated that enantiodiscrimination is feasible







Abstract
Anisotropic NMR spectroscopy, revealing residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs) has emerged as a powerful tool to determine the configurations of synthetic and complex natural compounds. The deduction of the absolute in addition to the relative configuration is one of the primary goals in the field. Therefore, the investigation of the enantiodiscriminating capabilities of chiral alignment media becomes essential. While RDCs and RCSAs are now used for the determination of the relative configuration routinely, RCSAs have not been measured in chiral alignment media such as chiral liquid crystals. Herein, we present this application by measuring RCSAs for chiral analytes such as indanol and isopinocampheol in the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase of an L&#8208;valine derived helically chiral polyacetylenes. We have also demonstrated that a single 1D 13C&#8722;{1H} NMR spectrum suffices to get the RCSAs circumventing the necessity to acquire two spectra at two alignment conditions.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Precise Detection of the Pulmonary Metastatic Tumors: A Traditional Molecule Having a Stunning Turn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reinventing strategy was exploited to develop an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (PMT9) for lung tumor&#8208;specific imaging. The obtained PMT9 exhibited ultra&#8208;sensitivity towards tumor metabolic acidity, which makes it exclusively shine in lung tumor lesions rather than normal lung tissues, enabling precise detection of pulmonary metastasis as well as primary lung tumor, with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
An accurate detection of lung metastasis is of great significance for making better treatment choices and improving cancer prognosis, but remains a big challenge in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a reinventing strategy to develop a pH&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoprobe, pulmonary metastasis tracer (denoted as PMT), based on assembly of NIR dye IR780 and calcium phosphate (CaP). By delicately tuning the intermolecular interactions during the assembly process and dye doping content, as well as the synthetic condition of probe, the fluorescence of PMT could be finely adjusted via the tumor acidity&#8208;triggered disassembly. Notably, the selected PMT9 could sharply convert subtle pH variations into a distinct fluorescence signal to generate high fluorescence ON/OFF contrast, dramatically reducing the background signals. Benefiting from such preferable features, PMT9 is able to precisely identify not only the tumor sites in orthotopic lung cancer models but also the pulmonary metastases in mice with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR). This study provides a unique strategy to turn shortcomings of traditional dye IR780 during in vivo imaging into advantages and further expand the application of fluorescent probe to image lung associated tumor lesions.

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the incorporation of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes, enabling the synthesis of otherwise unavailable complexes. Attachment of albumin&#8208;targeting maleimide moieties led to increased tumor accumulation and anticancer activity compared to oxaliplatin. The presented strategy will allow the development of new types of targeted multi&#8208;action platinum(IV) complexes.







Abstract
Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half&#8208;life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple&#8208;action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.

         <title>Supramolecular Barrel&#8208;Rosette Ion Channel Based on 3,5&#8208;Diaminobenzoic Acid for Cation&#8208;Anion Symport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;based supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette ion channels have been synthesized that possess a distinctive combination of hydrogen&#8208;bond forming and lone&#8208;pair donating groups within the channel cavity. This allows them to function as cation&#8208;anion symporters, with profound selectivity towards KClO4.







Abstract
The structural tropology and functions of natural cation&#8208;anion symporting channels have been continuously investigated due to their crucial role in regulating various physiological functions. To understand the physiological functions of the natural symporter channels, it is vital to develop small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based biomimicking systems that can provide mechanistic insights into the ion&#8208;binding sites and the ion&#8208;translocation pathways. Herein, we report a series of bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid based self&#8208;assembled ion channels with distinctive ion transport ability. Ion transport experiment across the lipid bilayer membrane revealed that compound 1&#8201;b exhibits the highest transport activity among the series, and it has interesting selective co&#8208;transporting functions, i.e., facilitates K+/ClO4&#8722; symport. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed the formation of supramolecular ion channels with an average diameter of 6.2&#177;1&#8197;&#197; and single channel conductance of 57.3&#177;1.9&#8197;pS. Selectivity studies of channel 1&#8201;b in a bilayer lipid membrane demonstrated a permeability ratio of 
, 
, and 
 indicating the higher selectivity of the channel towards KClO4 over KCl salt. A hexameric assembly of a trimeric rosette of 1&#8201;b was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with different salts to understand the supramolecular channel formation and ion selectivity pattern.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Spin Change of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Cluster Deconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing clusters as secondary building units are firstly realized, in which the clusters can be further removed via the post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
Spin crossover (SCO) materials with new architectures will expand and enrich the research in the SCO field. Here, we report two metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing tetradentate organic ligands and hexatopic linkers [Ag8X8(CN)6]6&#8722; (X=Br and I), which represents the first SCO MOF with clusters as building blocks. The silver halide cluster can be further removed after reacting with lithium tetracyanoquinodimethan (LiTCNQ). Such post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation from urk to nbo topology. Accordingly, the spin state and fluorescence properties are greatly modified by cluster deconstruction. Therefore, these achievements will provide new ideas for the design of new SCO systems and the development of PSM methods.

         <title>A GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist for Guiding MOF Discovery
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of using artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;human collaboration to advance reticular chemistry is shown. Through iterative learning, the GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist indicates instructions while evolving based on the feedback from a human researcher. It results in the innovative discovery of a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and suggests an approach for using large language models in experimental scientific research.







Abstract
We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT&#8208;4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT&#8208;4 in various capacities, wherein GPT&#8208;4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in&#8208;context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human&#8208;AI interaction enabled GPT&#8208;4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt&#8208;learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine&#8208;tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT&#8208;4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.

         <title>Simultaneous Capture of CO2 Boosting Its Electroreduction in the Micropores of a Metal&#8211;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction occurs in the pores of a porous catalyst possessing CO2 capture sites, which boosts the catalytic performance virtually independent on the CO2 concentration.







Abstract
Integration of CO2 capture capability from simulated flue gas and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) active sites into a catalyst is a promising cost&#8208;effective strategy for carbon neutrality, but is of great difficulty. Herein, combining the mixed gas breakthrough experiments and eCO2RR tests, we showed that an Ag12 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8208;NH2, aka Ag12bpy&#8208;NH2), simultaneously possessing CO2 capture sites as &#8220;CO2 relays&#8221; and eCO2RR active sites, can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2 from simulated flue gas (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;N2=15&#8201;:&#8201;85, at 298&#8197;K), but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2 into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2 conversion of 60&#8201;%. More importantly, its eCO2RR performance (a Faradaic efficiency (CO) of 96&#8201;% with a commercial current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a very low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V for 300&#8197;hours and the full&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 56&#8201;%) under simulated flue gas atmosphere is close to that under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere, and higher than those of all reported catalysts at higher potentials under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere. This work bridges the gap between CO2 enrichment/capture and eCO2RR.

         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process is presented herein by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This process is harnessed to develop a novel gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode.







Abstract
The successful realization of gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reactions, facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis, has been reported for the first time. This breakthrough has led to the development of gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode. The reaction mechanism has been elucidated through comprehensive experimental and computational studies.

         <title>A Bidentate Antimony Pnictogen Bonding Host System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidentate pnictogen&#8208;bonding host system based on Sb(C2F5)2 functions was constructed and its host&#8211;guest chemistry tested towards a variety of substrates including Me2O and its higher homologues, halide ions and N&#8208;heterocyclic bases. The new host system shows cooperativity of the two C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 functions during adduct formation. The complexes were analyzed both experimentally (XRD, NMR) and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA).







Abstract
A bidentate pnictogen bonding host&#8208;system based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene was synthesized by a selective tin&#8208;antimony exchange reaction and investigated regarding its ability to act as a Lewis acidic host component for the complexation of Lewis basic or anionic guests. In this work, the novel C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 unit was established to study the potential of antimony(III) sites as representatives for the scarcely explored pnictogen bonding donors. The capability of this partly fluorinated host system was investigated towards halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;), dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Y (Y=O, S, Se, Te), and nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine). Insights into the adduct formation behavior as well as the bonding situation of such E&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb&#8722;CF moieties were obtained in solution by means of NMR spectroscopy, in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by elemental analyses, and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA), respectively.

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8722; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimony guanidinate SbCN3 was produced in a high&#8208;pressure&#8208;high&#8208;temperature synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. The compound can be produced from elements as well as via a reaction between antimony and cyanuric triazide. This study demonstrates a straightforward route to novel nitridocarbonates. SbCN3 is a direct band gap semiconductor with Eg=2.20&#8197;eV as shown by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8722; and NCN2&#8722; carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8211;38&#8197;GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8722;, marking a fundamental milestone in carbonitride chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value of 2.20&#8197;eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.

         <title>Cover Picture: An Interlocked Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecular shuttle is reported by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310643). The rotaxane molecular shuttle operates through the invertible pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle between two sites of interactions of the encircled axle. As illustrated by the picture, the two loops of the eight&#8208;shaped rotaxane may be interdependently loosened and tightened. Increasing conformational degree of freedom of a loop results in the decreasing conformational degree of freedom of the other one.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides have shown intriguing potential in CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202305530), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. With Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it is demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Degenerate Semiconductor Photocatalysis for Efficient Water Splitting without Sacrificial Agents via a Reticular Chemistry Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&lt;70 &#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) due to the sluggish four&#8208;electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano&#8208;photocatalyst and metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by ~100&#8208;fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519 &#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high&#8208;energy photoelectrons on surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next&#8208;generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite With Heat Switching Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 exhibits heat switching birefringence which may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can switch light polarization have important applications in optoelectronics. In the last decades, birefringence is mostly optimized by chemical strategies. Recently, switching birefringence by physical means has attracted much attention. Here, this work reports the observation of heat switching birefringence in a 2D layered hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 ((C2N3H4)+=1,2,4&#8208;triazolium). This heat switching birefringence leads to a significant change in the interference color for the crystal plate under the illumination of orthogonal polarized light. Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C2N3H4)2PbCl4, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl6 octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.

         <title>Dearomative Ring&#8208;Fused Azafulleroids and Carbazole&#8208;Derived Metallofullerenes: Reactivity Dictated by Encapsulation in a Fullerene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent reactivities of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls toward C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 have been disclosed. In the case of C60, a dearomative cascade reaction results in the formation of azafulleroids fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system, whereas Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 undergoes a C&#8722;H insertion pathway, with the generation of carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208; and [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroids and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene.







Abstract
Herein, we report divergent additions of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls to C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80. In stark contrast to that of the previously reported bis&#8208;azide additions, the unexpected cascade reaction leads to the dearomative formation of azafulleroids 2 fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system in the case of C60. In contrast, the corresponding reaction with Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 switches to the C&#8722;H insertion pathway, thereby resulting in multiple isomers, including a carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 3 and a [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 4 and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene 5, whose molecular structures have been unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Among them, the addition type of 5 is observed for the first time in all reported additions of azides to fullerenes. Furthermore, unexpected isomerizations from 3 to 5 and from 4 to 5 have been discovered, providing the first examples of the isomerization of an azafulleroid to a carbazole&#8208;derived fullerene rather than an aziridinofullerene. In particular, the isomerism of the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 4 to the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 5 is unprecedented in fullerene chemistry, contradicting the present understanding that isomerization generally occurs between [5,6]&#8208; and [6,6]&#8208;isomers. Control experiments have been carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, representative azafulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells, thereby resulting in improved power conversion efficiencies.

         <title>Narrowband Fluorescent Emitters Based on BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband green and red fluorescent emitters by fusing naphthalene with multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped frameworks manifest near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm. The resulting electroluminescent devices achieve high external quantum efficiency, low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using conventional fluorescent emitters are currently attracting considerable interests due to outstanding stability and abundant raw materials. To construct high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores to satisfy requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays, a strategy fusing multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped moieties to naphthalene is proposed to construct two novel narrowband fluorophores. Green Na&#8722;sBN and red Na&#8722;dBN, manifest narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and molecular horizontal dipole ratios above 90&#8201;%. Their OLEDs exhibit the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes. The Na&#8722;sBN&#8208;based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8&#8201;% and remains 19.8&#8201;% even at luminance of 100,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Na&#8722;dBN&#8208;based device acquires a record&#8208;high EQE of 25.2&#8201;% among all red OLEDs using pure fluorescent emitters.

         <title>Manipulating Lone&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Luminescence in 0D Tin Halides by Pressure&#8208;Tuned Stereochemical Activity from Static to Dynamic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;driven stereochemical activity transformation of the lone pair from static to dynamic was achieved in 0D 5&#8197;s2 metal halides, corresponding to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission switching from a red broadband triplet emission to a sky&#8208;blue narrowband singlet emission.







Abstract
The excellent luminescence properties and structural dynamics driven by the stereoactivity of the lone pair in a variety of low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides have attracted growing investigations for optoelectronic applications. However, the structural and photophysical aspects of the excited state associated with the lone pair expression are currently open questions. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional Sn&#8208;based halides with static stereoactive 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs are selected as a model system to understand the correlations between the distinctive lone pair expression and the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation and charge carrier dynamics by continuous lattice manipulation. Lattice compression drives 5&#8197;s2 lone pair active switching and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) redistribution by suppressing excited&#8208;state structural deformation of the isolated SnBr42&#8722; units. Our results demonstrate that the static expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair results in a red broadband triplet STE emission with a large Stokes shift, while its dynamic expression creates a sky&#8208;blue narrowband emission dominated by the radiative recombination of singlet STEs. Our findings and the photophysical mechanism proposed highlight the stereochemical effects of lone pair expression in controlling light emission properties and offer constructive guidelines for tuning the optoelectronic properties in diverse ns2 metal halides.

         <title>Photocatalytic Enantioselective Hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls with Sulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls has been established, utilizing readily accessible sulfonyl chlorides, and facilitated by visible light irradiation in conjunction with chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis. This protocol enables the production of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity.







Abstract
This research explores the enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the use of visible light and redox&#8208;active chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis, facilitating the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity (exceeding 99&#8201;% ee). A significant challenge entails enhancing the reactivity between chiral metal&#8208;coordinated carbonyl compounds and moderate electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, aiming to minimize the background reactions. The success of our approach stems from two distinctive attributes: 1) the Cl&#8208;atom abstraction employed for sulfonyl radical generation from sulfonyl chlorides, and 2) the single&#8208;electron reduction to produce a key enolate radical Ni&#8208;complex. The latter process appears to enhance the feasibility of the sulfonyl radical's addition to the electron&#8208;rich enolate radical. An in&#8208;depth investigation into the reaction mechanism, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, offers insight into the intricate reaction process. Moreover, the versatility of our methodology is highlighted through its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules, demonstrating its practicality as a strategy for producing &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones.

         <title>Controllable Topological Transformations of 818 Molecular Metalla&#8208;knots by Oxidation of Thiazole&#8208;Based Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric dipyridyl ligand containing a thiazole moiety and two tetracene&#8208;based bimetallic building blocks have be used to synthesize two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots in high yields. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation of the thiazole&#8208;based ligand under mild conditions resulted in the transformation of the 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots into simple tetranuclear macrocycles.







Abstract
By exploiting coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, high yields of two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be obtained using a thiazole&#8208;moiety&#8208;containing asymmetric dipyridyl ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole (L1), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF/MS), and detailed liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To modulate the self&#8208;assembled structures, m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) was utilized to oxidize thiazole&#8208;based ligand L1 to N&#8208;thiazole&#8208;oxide&#8208;based ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole 3&#8208;oxide (L2), which enabled the selective construction of the corresponding tetranuclear macrocycles. Notably, two molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be topologically transformed from 818 knots to simple monocycles because the L1 alkyne bond was inert toward m&#8208;CPBA, as confirmed by liquid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and elemental analysis.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation of tertiary allylic carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. The alkylated products are obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity towards the kinetic branched regioisomer.

Abstract
Here, we report the development of cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation reactions of tertiary allyl carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. A family of well&#8208;defined tetrahedral cobalt(I) complexes bearing commercially available bidentate bis(phosphine) ligands [(P,P)Co(PPh3)Cl] are synthesized and explored as catalysts in allylic alkylation reactions. The catalyst [(dppp)Co(PPh3)Cl] (dppp=1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) enables the alkylation of a large variety of tertiary allyl carbonates with high yields and excellent regioselectivity for the branched product. Remarkably, this methodology is selective for the activation of tertiary allyl carbonates even in the presence of secondary allyl carbonates. This contrasts with the selectivity observed in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations enabled by visible light photocatalysis. Mechanistic insights by means of experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Iodotrimethylsilane as a Reactive Ligand for Surface Etching and Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals toward Efficient Pure&#8208;red to Deep&#8208;red LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange strategy to resurface perovskite nanocrystal surfaces with a chemically active, short and conductive ligand, Iodotrimethylsilane (TMIS), which also functions as a surface passivant. Excellent conductivity and photostability allowed us to fabricate compact, high&#8208;mobility and trap&#8208;free perovskite NC films with high PLQY (&gt;90%). As a result, we achieve CsPbI3 NC&#8208;based PeLEDs with an EQE of ~23%.







Abstract
Resurfacing perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tight&#8208;binding and conductive ligands to resolve the dynamic ligands&#8212;surface interaction is the fundamental issue for their applications in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Although various types of surface ligands have been proposed, these ligands either exhibit weak Lewis acid/base interactions or need high polar solvents for dissolution and passivation, resulting in a compromise in the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. Herein, we report a chemically reactive agent (Iodotrimethylsilane, TMIS) to address the trade&#8208;off among conductivity, solubility and passivation using all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 NCs. The liquid TMIS ensures good solubility in non&#8208;polar solvents and reacts with oleate ligands and produces in situ HI for surface etching and passivation, enabling strong&#8208;binding ligands on the NCs surface. We report, as a result, red PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;%, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than the control, and is among the highest CsPbI3 PeLEDs. We further demonstrate the universality of this ligand strategy in the pure bromide system (CsPbBr3), and report EQE of &#8776;20&#8201;% at 640, 652, and 664&#8197;nm. This represents the first demonstration of a chemically reactive ligand strategy that applies to different systems and works effectively in red PeLEDs spanning emission from pure&#8208;red to deep&#8208;red.

         <title>Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization of Ribosomal Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 enzymes are highly effective catalysts, yet little research has been conducted on their ability to modify ribosomal peptides. Now uncharted bacterial cytochrome P450s responsible for the macrocyclization of ribosomal peptides have been discovered by sequence&#8208; and 3D&#8208;structure&#8208;based genome mining. These P450s exhibit diverse catalytic capabilities, catalyzing aromatic crosslinking by forming C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a fascinating group of natural products that exhibit diverse structural features and bioactivities. P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs stand out as a unique but underexplored family. Herein, we introduce a rule&#8208;based genome mining strategy that harnesses the intrinsic biosynthetic principles of RiPPs, including the co&#8208;occurrence and co&#8208;conservation of precursors and P450s and interactions between them, successfully facilitating the identification of diverse P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs. Intensive BGC characterization revealed four new P450s, KstB, ScnB, MciB, and SgrB, that can catalyze the formation of Trp&#8208;Trp&#8208;Tyr (one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds), Tyr&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;C bond), Trp&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;N bond), and His&#8208;His (ether bond) crosslinks, respectively, within three or four residues. KstB, ScnB, and MciB could accept non&#8208;native precursors, suggesting they could be promising starting templates for bioengineering to construct macrocycles. Our study highlights the potential of P450s to expand the chemical diversity of strained macrocyclic peptides and the range of biocatalytic tools available for peptide macrocyclization.

These P450s exhibit diverse catalytic capabilities, catalyzing aromatic crosslinking by forming C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a fascinating group of natural products that exhibit diverse structural features and bioactivities. P450-catalyzed RiPPs stand out as a unique but underexplored family. Herein, we introduce a rule-based genome mining strategy that harnesses the intrinsic biosynthetic principles of RiPPs, including the co-occurrence and co-conservation of precursors and P450s and interactions between them, successfully facilitating the identification of diverse P450-catalyzed RiPPs. Intensive BGC characterization revealed four new P450s, KstB, ScnB, MciB, and SgrB, that can catalyze the formation of Trp-Trp-Tyr (one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds), Tyr-Trp (C&#8722;C bond), Trp-Trp (C&#8722;N bond), and His-His (ether bond) crosslinks, respectively, within three or four residues. KstB, ScnB, and MciB could accept non-native precursors, suggesting they could be promising starting templates for bioengineering to construct macrocycles. Our study highlights the potential of P450s to expand the chemical diversity of strained macrocyclic peptides and the range of biocatalytic tools available for peptide macrocyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infinite Twisted Polycatenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise approach was developed to construct figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight polycatenanes using preorganized double helicates as templates and crosslinking them with silver ions or ethynylene units. Employing Ag(I) ions or ethynylene units as linkers resulted in single&#8208;crystalline 1D coordination poly[n]catenanes and assembling gel fibers, respectively.







Abstract
Poly[n]catenanes have exceptional mechanical bonding properties that give them tremendous potential for use in the development of molecular machines and soft materials. Synthesizing these compounds has, however, proven to be a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a concise method for the construction of twisted polycatenanes. Our approach involves using preorganized double helicates as templates, linked crosswise in a linear fashion by either silver ions or triple bonds. By using this approach, we successfully synthesized twisted polycatenanes with both coordination and covalent bonding employing Ag(I) ions and ethynylene units, respectively, as the linkages and leveraging the same Ag(I)&#8208;templated double helicate in both cases. Synthesis with Ag(I) ions formed a single&#8208;crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination poly[n]catenane, and synthesis using ethynylene units generated 1D fibers which self&#8208;assembled with solvents to form a gel. Our results confirm the potential of multi&#8208;stranded metallohelicates for creating sophisticated mechanically interlocked molecules and polymers, which could pave the way for exploration in the realms of molecular nanotopology and materials design.

         <title>An NIR Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on and MRl Bimodal Probe for Concurrent Real&#8208;time in vivo Sensing and Labeling of &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal imaging probe, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1, has been developed to monitor &#946;&#8208;gal activity in real&#8208;time and to provide valuable assistance for precise tumour removal during surgery in vivo using NIR fluorescence and MRI. Activation of &#946;&#8208;gal results in an increase in the NIR fluorescence intensity, allowing sensitive covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins to promote probe accumulation at the tumour site, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI.







Abstract
To realize sensing and labeling biomarkers is quite challenging in terms of designing multimodal imaging probes. In this study, we developed a novel &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activated bimodal imaging probe that combines near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enable real&#8208;time visualization of activity in living organisms. Upon &#946;&#8208;gal activation, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable 42&#8208;fold increase in NIR fluorescence intensity at 717&#8197;nm, allowing covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins and avoiding molecular escape to promote probe accumulation at the tumor site. This fluorescence reaction enhances the longitudinal relaxivity by approximately 1.9 times, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI. The unique features of Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 enable real&#8208;time and precise visualization of &#946;&#8208;gal activity in live tumor cells and mice. The probe's utilization aids in identifying in situ ovarian tumors, offering valuable assistance in the precise removal of tumor tissue during surgical procedures in mice. The fusion of NIR fluorescence and MRI activation through self&#8208;immobilizing target enzymes or proteins provides a robust approach for visualizing &#946;&#8208;gal activity. Moreover, this approach sets the groundwork for developing other activatable bimodal probes, allowing real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of enzyme activity and localization.

         <title>Sustained Hydrogen Spillover on Pt/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy: Dynamic Insights into Gas&#8208;Induced Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen spillover, involving the surface migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from active metal sites to the relatively inert catalyst support, plays a crucial role in hydrogen&#8208;involved catalytic processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of how H atoms are driven to spill over from active sites onto the catalyst support is still lacking. Here, we examine the atomic&#8208;scale perspective of the H spillover process on a Pt/Cu(111) single atom alloy surface using machine&#8208;learning accelerated molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory. Our results show that when an impinging H2 dissociates at an active Pt site, the Pt atom undergoes deactivation due to the dissociated hydrogen atoms that attach to it. Interestingly, collisions between H2 and sticking H atoms facilitate H spillover onto the host Cu, leading to the reactivation of the Pt atom and the realization of a continuous H spillover process. This work underscores the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates as a driving force in elucidating chemical processes under a gaseous atmosphere, which has so far been underappreciated in thermodynamic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Evoking Ferroptosis by Synergistic Enhancement of a Cyclopentadienyl Iridium&#8208;Betulin Immune Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) with potential of antitumor immunity activation. Herein, a nonferrous cyclopentadienyl metal&#8208;based ferroptosis inducer [Ir(Cp*)(Bet)Cl]Cl (Ir&#8208;Bet) is developed via metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy by the reaction of [Ir(Cp*)Cl]2 with natural product Betulin. The fusion of Betulin with&#160;iridium cyclopentadienyl (Ir&#8208;Cp*) species as Ir&#8208;Bet not only tremendously enhances the antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells, but also activates ferritinophagy for iron homeostasis regulation by PI3k/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibition with a lower dosage of Betulin, and then evokes immune response by nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation of Ir&#8208;Cp* species. Further immunogenic cell death (ICD) is intensified by remarkable ferroptosis through glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation and ferritinophagy. The in vivo vaccination experiment demonstrates desirable antitumor and immunogenic effects of Ir&#8208;Bet by increasing ratio of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) / regulatory T cells (Tregs). This work provides a new approach for future development of effective metal&#8208;based immunochemotherapeutic agents via MLSE strategy from metal species and natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Low&#8208;temperature Performance and Stability of Na2Ti6O13 Anodes by the Ti&#8722;O Spring Effect through Nb&#8208;doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated effects of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies modulation are achieved via high valence state ion&#8208;doping in case of Nb5+. The modified samples optimized excellent long&#8208;cycle stability, and superior low&#8208;temperature performance in the full cell. Importantly, it is demonstrated for the first time that high&#8208;valent transition metal preferentially replaces the Ti3 site of NTO, effectively improving electrical conductivity and ion diffusion rate. More interestingly, the &#8220;spring effect&#8221; of chemical bonding, which is twisted&#8208;recovered&#8208;twisted with the motion of Na+, is investigated for the first time by in situ Raman, and the stabilizing effect of Nb enables the more regular and reversible &#8220;spring effect&#8221;.







Abstract
Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb&#8208;doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92&#8201;% reversible capacity retained after 3000&#8197;cycles at 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, unexpected low&#8208;temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What's more important, both the in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8722;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.

More interestingly, the &#8220;spring effect&#8221; of chemical bonding, which is twisted-recovered-twisted with the motion of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is investigated for the first time by in situ Raman, and the stabilizing effect of Nb enables the more regular and reversible &#8220;spring effect&#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium-ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re-distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb-doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92&#8201;% reversible capacity retained after 3000&#8197;cycles at 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, unexpected low-temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What's more important, both the in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8722;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lignin Upconversion by Functionalization and Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin, a complex and abundant biopolymer derived from plant cell walls, has emerged as a promising feedstock for sustainable material development. Due to the high abundance of phenylpropanoid units, aromatic rings, and hydroxyl groups, lignin is an ideal candidate for being explored in various material applications. Therefore, the demand on lignin valorization for development of value&#8208;added products is significantly increasing. This mini&#8208;review provides an overview of lignin upconversion, focusing on its functionalization through chemical and enzymatic routes, and its application in lignin&#8208;based polymer resins, hydrogels, and nanomaterials. The functionalization of lignin molecules with various chemical groups offers tailored properties and increased compatibility with other materials, expanding its potential applications. Additionally, the formation of lignin&#8208;based networks, either through cross&#8208;linking or blending with polymers, generates novel materials with improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. However, challenges remain in optimizing functionalization techniques, preserving the innate complexity of lignin, and achieving scalability for industrial implementation. As lignin's potential continues to be unlocked, it is poised to contribute significantly to the shift towards more eco&#8208;friendly and resource&#8208;efficient industries</dc:description>

         <title>Clustering Six Electrons within &#8220;Dawson&#8208;Like&#8221; Polyoxometalate: An Open Route toward Its Post&#8208;functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;reduction of polyoxometalates (POMs) in solution is of fundamental interest for designing innovative energy storage systems. In this article, we show that the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM can undergo a disproportionation process during its massive electron uptake, leading to species containing three metal&#8208;metal bonds as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 183W NMR), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), UV&#8208;vis, and voltammetry techniques. This result indicates that electron storing within metal&#8208;metal bonds is not a unique property of Keggin&#8208;type POM as postulated since the 70s. Besides, we demonstrate that the presence of an electron&#8208;rich triad in the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM allows its post&#8208;functionalization with additional tungstate ions, generating a chiral molecule that is also the largest WIV&#8208;containing POMs known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Ta/Cu Architectures via Metal&#8208;Metal Salt Metatheses: Heterobimetallic C&#8211;H Bond Activation Affords &#181;&#8208;Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We employ a metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis strategy to access low&#8208;valent tantalum&#8208;copper heterometallic architectures (Ta&#8211;&#181;2&#8208;H2&#8211;Cu and Ta&#8211;&#181;3&#8208;H2&#8211;Cu3) that emulate structural elements proposed for surface alloyed nanomaterials. Whereas cluster assembly with carbonylmetalates is well precedented, the use of the corresponding polyarene transition metal anions is underexplored, despite recognition of these highly reactive fragments as storable sources of atomic Mn&#8211;. Our application of this strategy provides structurally unique early&#8208;late bimetallic species. These complexes incorporate bridging hydride ligands during their syntheses, the origin of which is elucidated via detailed isotopic labelling studies. Modification of ancillary ligand sterics and electronics alters the mechanism of bimetallic assembly; a trinuclear&#160;complex resulting from dinuclear C&#8211;H activation is demonstrated as an intermediate en route to formation of the bimetallic. Further validating the promise of this rational, bottom&#8208;up approach, a unique tetranuclear species was synthesized, featuring a Ta centre bearing three Ta&#8211;Cu interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic C&#8211;H Bond Activation by Phosphine&#8211;Quinone&#8208;Based Radical Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the formation of transient radical ion pairs (RIPs) by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) in phosphine&#8211;quinone systems and explore their potential for the activation of C&#8211;H bonds. PMes3 (Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reacts with DDQ (2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) with formation of the P&#8211;O bonded zwitterionic adduct Mes3P&#8211;DDQ (1), while the reaction with the sterically more crowded PTip3 (Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) afforded C&#8211;H bond activation product Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2(DDQ)]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (2). UV&#8208;Vis and EPR spectroscopic studies showed that the latter reaction proceeds via initial SET, forming RIP [PTip3]&#8226;+[DDQ]&#8226;&#8211;, and subsequent homolytic C&#8211;H bond activation, which was supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Toward De Novo Catalyst Discovery: Fast Identification of New Catalyst Candidates for Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently we have demonstrated how a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from random tertiary amines can be used to discover a new and efficient catalyst for the alcohol&#8208;mediated Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction. In particular, the discovered catalyst was shown experimentally to be eight times more active than DABCO, commonly used to catalyze the MBH reaction. This represents a breakthrough in using generative models for catalyst optimization. However, the GA&#8208;procedure, and hence discovery, relied on two important pieces of information; 1) the knowledge that tertiary amines catalyze the reaction and 2) the mechanism and reaction profile for the catalyzed reaction, in particular the transition state structure of the rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, truly de novo catalyst discovery must include these steps. Here we present such a method for discovering catalyst candidates for a specific reaction while simultaneously proposing a mechanism for the catalyzed reaction. We show that tertiary amines and phosphines are potential catalysts for the MBH reaction by screening 11 molecular templates representing common functional groups. The method relies on an automated reaction discovery workflow using meta&#8208;dynamics calculations. Combining this method for catalyst candidate discovery with our GA&#8208;based catalyst optimization method results in an algorithm for truly de novo catalyst discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A&#160;BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8210;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of 4 with a diazo compound produces a cationic B2N3C pentafulvene derivative 7.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Polymer for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion and Zinc Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;based materials are promising single&#8208;site catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8211;) reduction to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) on account of well&#8208;defined structures and functional tunability but still lack a molecular&#8208;level understanding for designing the high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Here, we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to enhance electrochemical NO3&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (BTA) based metal&#8208;organic polymer to precisely modulate the electronic state of metal centers. Due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the carbonyl group, metal centers can be converted to an electron&#8208;deficient state, fascinating the NO3&#8211; adsorption and promoting continuous hydrogenation reactions to produce NH3. Compared to CuBTA with a low NO3&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion efficiency of 85.1%, quinone group functionalization endows the resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone (CuTABQ) distinguished performance with a much higher NH3 FE of 97.7%. This molecular engineering strategy is also universal, as verified by the improved NO3&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion performance on different metal centers, including Co and Ni. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8211; battery based on CuTABQ cathode can deliver a high power density of 12.3 mW&#8201;cm&#8211;2.This work provides advanced insights into the rational design of metal complex catalysts through the molecular&#8208;level regulation for NO3&#8211; electroreduction to value&#8208;added NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitisers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable bandgaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesised, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8208;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realise the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the bandgap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitisers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customised treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;based Bactericide for Efficient Healing of Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide with precisely organized bacterial membrane breaker (DNAzymes, G4/hemin) and abundantly loaded broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic (levofloxacin) was constructed for the efficient healing of infected wounds under the guidance of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Bacteria infection is a significant obstacle in the clinical treatment of exposed wounds facing widespread pathogens. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide for efficient anti&#8208;infection therapy of infected wounds in vivo. In our design, abundant DNAzymes (G4/hemin) can be precisely organized on the DNA origami for controllable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break bacterial membranes. After the destruction of the membrane, broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic levofloxacin (LEV, loaded in the DNA origami through interaction with DNA duplex) can be easily delivered into the bacteria for successful sterilization. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan, the DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide can achieve targeted and combined antibacterial therapy for efficiently promoting the healing of infected wounds. This tailored DNA origami&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases in vivo.

         <title>Mechanical effects of elastic crystals driven by natural sunlight and force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible crystals that can capture solar energy and convert it into mechanical energy are promising for a wide range of applications in areas such as information storage, and actuators, but obtaining them remains a challenge. Herein, the elastic crystal of a barbiturate derivative was found to be an excellent candidate, and showed plastic bending behavior under natural sunlight irradiation. 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum data of the microcrystals before and after light irradiation demonstrated that the light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition was the driving force for the photomechanical effects. Interestingly, the crystals remained well elastic properties after light irradiation. This is the first reported crystal that can be driven by natural sunlight, and has both photomechanical properties and elasticity. Furthermore, we could regulate the passive light output direction of the crystals and transport objects by applying mechanical forces and light.</dc:description>

         <title>An Oxysulfide Photocatalyst Evolving Hydrogen with an Apparent Quantum Efficiency of 30&#8201;% under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces loaded with ultrafine composite cocatalyst particles evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is a simple means of converting solar energy into storable hydrogen energy. Narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalysts have attracted much attention in this regard owing to the significant visible&#8208;light absorption and relatively high stability of these compounds. However, existing materials suffer from low efficiencies due to difficulties in synthesizing these oxysulfides with suitable degrees of crystallinity and particle sizes, and in constructing effective reaction sites. The present work demonstrates the production of a Gd2Ti2O5S2 (&#955;&lt;650&#8197;nm) photocatalyst capable of efficiently driving photocatalytic reactions. Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces were synthesized by flux and chemical etching methods. Ultrafine Pt&#8208;IrO2 cocatalyst particles that promoted hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution reactions were subsequently loaded on the Gd2Ti2O5S2 while ensuring an intimate contact by employing a microwave&#8208;heating technique. The optimized Gd2Ti2O5S2 was found to evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. This material was also stable during O2 evolution in the presence of a sacrificial reagent. The results presented herein demonstrates a highly efficient narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalyst with potential applications in practical solar hydrogen production.

This material was also stable during O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution in the presence of a sacrificial reagent.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Distribution&#8208;Directed Regioselective Substitution Strategy for Highly Stable Olympicenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed protection&#8211;oxidation&#8211;protection (P&#8722;O&#8722;P) strategy was developed for olympicenyl radical, which resulted in a series of highly stable &#960;&#8208;radicals. The substitution on the periphery exerted a substantial influence on the crystal packing, leading to the first stable field&#8208;effect transistor based on graphenic radicals.







Abstract
The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable conjugated &#960;&#8208;radicals is challenging owing to the lack of modular approaches, which greatly hampers their practical material screens and applications. Here, we demonstrate a spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed regioselective substitution strategy to introduce substituents into the specific positions of an olympicenyl radical in a stepwise manner, resulting in a series of highly stable radical species. The substituents can also adjust the crystal packing by means of steric and electronic factors, enabling the changing from a &#960;&#8208;dimer to a pseudo&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional chain. The first single crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device based on a graphenic radical is fabricated in air, showing a hole mobility of up to 0.021&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent device stability. This approach may be generalized to diverse spin&#8208;delocalized open&#8208;shell organic radicals.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activating Biomimetic Polyoxomolybdate for Boosting Oxygen Evolution in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;transfer photochromism is used to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, providing an innovative design concept for the development of non&#8208;precious metal OER catalysts in artificial photosynthesis devices.







Abstract
Inspired by the metal&#8208;oxo cluster structural feature and charge separation behaviour of the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II (PS&#8208;II) under photoirradiation, a new crystalline photochromic polyoxomolybdate, MV2[&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26] (1, MV=methyl viologen cation), is designed as a biomimetic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in neutral electrolytes. After photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) with colour change from colourless to grey, it remains in an ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated state over a year under ambient conditions. The observed overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope decrease by 49&#8197;mV and 62.8&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1 after coloration, respectively. The outstanding OER performance of the coloured state in neutral electrolytes even outperforms the commercial RuO2 benchmark. Experimental and theoretical studies show that oxygen holes within polyanions after irradiation serve as sites for enhancing direct O&#8722;O coupling, thus effectively promoting OER. This is the first successful application of electron&#8208;transfer photochromism to realize OER activity gain.

         <title>Optimized Crystal Framework by Asymmetric Core Isomerization in Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both the regional isomerization and selenium&#8208;substitution of the small molecular acceptors (SMAs) play significant roles in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), while their synergistic effects remain elusive. Herein, we developed three isomeric SMAs (S&#8208;CSeF, A&#8208;ISeF, and A&#8208;OSeF) via subtly manipulating the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position (central, inner, or outer) and type of heteroaromatic ring on the central core by synergistic strategies for efficient OSCs, respectively. Crystallography of asymmetric A&#8208;OSeF presents a closer intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and more ordered 3&#8208;dimensional network packing and efficient charge&#8208;hopping pathways. With the successive out&#8208;shift of the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position, the neat films give a slightly wider bandgap and gradually higher crystallinity and electron mobility. The PM1:A&#8208;OSeF afford favourable fibrous phase separation morphology with more ordered molecular packing and efficient charge transportation compared to the other two counterparts. Consequently, the A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based devices achieve a champion efficiency of 18.5%, which represents the record values for the reported selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our developed precise molecular engineering of the position and type of selenium&#8208;based heteroaromatic ring of SMAs provides a promising synergistic approach to optimizing crystal stacking and boosting top&#8208;ranked selenium&#8208;containing SMAs&#8208;based OSCs.</dc:description>
