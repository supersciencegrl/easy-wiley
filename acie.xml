         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Gradient&#8208;Distributed Dielectric Properties toward Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conventional conductive three&#8208;dimensional (3D) host fails to effectively stabilize lithium metal anodes (LMAs) due to the internal incongruity arising from nonuniform lithium&#8208;ion gradient and uniform electric fields. This results in undesirable Li "top&#8208;growth" behavior and dendritic Li growth, significantly impeding the practical application of LMAs. Herein, we construct a 3D hierarchical host with gradient&#8208;distributed dielectric properties (GDD&#8208;CH) that effectively regulate Li&#8208;ion diffusion and deposition behavior. It comprises a 3D carbon fiber host modified by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Sb particles, which could promote Li&#8208;ion homogeneously distribution and reduce ion concentration gradient via unique gradient dielectric polarization. Sb transforms into superionic conductive Li3Sb alloy during cycling, facilitating Li&#8208;ion dredging and pumps towards the bottom, dominating a bottom&#8208;up deposition regime confirmed by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and physicochemical characterizations. Consequently, a stable cycling performance of symmetrical cells over 2000 h under a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved. The GDD&#8208;CH&#8208;based lithium metal battery shows remarkable cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 378 Wh kg&#8208;1 with a low N/P ratio (1.51). This strategy of dielectric gradient design broadens the perspective for regulating the Li deposition mechanism and paves the way for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal anodes with long durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium (II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation with Bifunctional Ligands: From Curiosity to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 2001, our curiosity about the stereochemistry of Pd C&#8722;H metalation prompted our research into Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Since then, we have developed many new strategies to solve the four central challenges of reactivity, site&#8208;selectivity, enantioselectivity, and practicality.







Abstract
In 2001, our curiosity to understand the stereochemistry of C&#8722;H metalation with Pd prompted our first studies in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation (RSC Research appointment: 020 7451 2545, Grant: RG 36873, Dec. 2002). We identified four central challenges: 1.&#8197;poor reactivity of simple Pd salts with native substrates; 2.&#8197;few strategies to control site selectivity for remote C&#8722;H bonds; 3.&#8197;the lack of chiral catalysts to achieve enantioselectivity via asymmetric C&#8722;H metalation, and 4.&#8197;low practicality due to limited coupling partner scope and the use of specialized oxidants. These challenges necessitated new strategies in catalyst and reaction development. For reactivity, we developed approaches to enhance substrate&#8211;catalyst affinity together with novel bifunctional ligands which participate in and accelerate the C&#8722;H cleavage step. For site&#8208;selectivity, we introduced the concept of systematically modulating the distance and geometry between a directing template, catalyst, and substrate to selectively access remote C&#8722;H bonds. For enantioselectivity, we devised predictable stereomodels for catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective C&#8722;H activation based on the participation of bifunctional ligands. Finally, for practicality, we have developed varied catalytic manifolds for Pd(II) to accommodate diverse coupling partners while employing practical oxidants such as simple peroxides. These advances have culminated in numerous C&#8722;H activation reactions, setting the stage for broad industrial applications.

         <title>Observation of Iron with Eight Coordination in Iron Trifluoride under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diminutive ionic radius of fluorine implies probable hypercoordination in Fe&#8722;F systems. Employing sophisticated crystal structure prediction and high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature experiments, a stable orthorhombic phase of FeF3 featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is revealed under extreme conditions. This discovery advances comprehension of iron&#8208;based structure and contributes to exploring chemical hypercoordination phenomena.







Abstract
The chemistry of hypercoordination has been a subject of fundamental interest, especially for understanding structures that challenge conventional wisdom. The small ionic radii of Fe ions typically result in coordination numbers of 4 or 6 in stable Fe&#8208;bearing ionic compounds. While 8&#8208;coordinated Fe has been observed in highly compressed oxides, the pursuit of hypercoordinated Fe still faces significant challenges due to the complexity of synthesizing the anticipated compound with another suitable anion. Through first&#8208;principles simulation and advanced crystal structure prediction methods, we predict that an orthorhombic phase of FeF3 with exclusively 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is energetically stable above 18&#8197;GPa&#8212;a pressure more feasibly achieved compared to oxides. Inspired by this theoretical result, we conducted extensive experiments using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell technique to investigate the crystal structures of FeF3 at high&#8208;pressure conditions. We successfully synthesized the predicted orthorhombic phase of FeF3 at 46&#8197;GPa, as confirmed by in situ experimental X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This work establishes a new ionic compound featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe in a simple binary Fe&#8208;bearing system and paves the way for discovering Fe hypercoordination in similar systems.

         <title>O&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of Carboxylic Acids via the Formation and Activation of Acyloxy(phenyl)trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>

         <dc:description>
The first general method for accessing various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters through the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids is reported. The activation effect of ZnCl2 on acyloxy(phenyltrifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes has been studied by DFT calculations and control experiments. The reaction can be used for late&#8208;stage modification of drugs and bioactive carboxylic acids as well.







Abstract
Here we report the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids via the formation and activation of acyloxy(phenyl)trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes. The method provides an easy access to various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters. A remarkably wide range of substrates with commonly encountered functional groups are compatible with this reaction, including aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the enhanced reactivity by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) were discussed from experimental evidence and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Oxo Electronic Tuning via In Situ CO Decoration for Promoting Methane Conversion to Oxygenates over Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ CO decoration can significantly tune the electronic state of metal&#8208;oxo center in single&#8208;atom catalysts for promoting oxygenates production. CO activated Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 displays the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8722;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 ever reported at room temperature and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C&#8208;atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd1, which donates electrons to the Pd1&#8722;O active center (L&#8722;Pd1&#8722;O, L=CO) generated by H2O2 oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8722;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8722;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 (M=Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2&#8211;11.3&#8197;times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal&#8208;oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.

&lt;p&gt;In situ CO decoration can significantly tune the electronic state of metal-oxo center in single-atom catalysts for promoting oxygenates production. CO activated Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ZSM-5 displays the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as oxidant at 25&#8201;&#176;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8722;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ZSM-5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; ever reported at room temperature and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C-atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which donates electrons to the Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O active center (L&#8722;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O, L=CO) generated by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8722;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8722;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ZSM-5 (M=Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2&#8211;11.3&#8197;times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal-oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Depicting the Chemical Diversity of Bioactive Meroterpenoids Produced by the Largest Organism on Earth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids from Armillaria ostoyae in liquid and solid fermentations yielded 17 new and 21 known derivatives. A compound library enabled metabolomics, unveiling production patterns under varied culture conditions. Assessment of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, aided by innovative chemoinformatics, offered insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
In this investigation, we explored the diversity of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids produced by Armillaria ostoyae, one of the largest and oldest organisms on Earth, using extracts from liquid and solid fermentation media. The study unveiled three unprecedented dimeric bismelleolides and three novel fatty&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted congeners, along with 11 new and 21 known derivatives. The structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and HRESI&#8208;MS, and ROESY spectral analysis for relative configurations. Absolute configurations were determined from crystal structures and through ECD spectra comparison. A compound library of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids facilitated metabolomics&#8208;wide associations, revealing production patterns under different culture conditions. The library enabled assessments of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, revealing that the &#916;2,4 double bond is not crucial for antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity was linked to the presence of an aldehyde at C1, but lost with hydroxylation at C13. Chemoinformatic analyses demonstrated the intricate interplay of chemical modifications on biological properties. This study marks the first systematic exploration of Armillaria spp. meroterpenoid diversity by MS&#8208;based untargeted metabolomics, offering insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships through innovative chemoinformatics.

         <title>Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks: Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Conversion of Porous Structures and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photoresponsive porous frameworks were created by integrating protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units onto pore walls of 1D channels, constructing a broad spectrum of photoresponsive pores. The frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights, convert pores into new ones via photoisomerization, and achieve benchmark changes in pore size, shape, number, and environment as well as gas uptake and release, opening a way to novel smart porous materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a novel class of crystalline porous polymers that enable molecular design of extended polygonal skeletons to attain well&#8208;defined porous structures. However, construction of a framework that allows remote control of pores remains a challenge. Here we report a strategy that merges covalent, noncovalent, and photo chemistries to design photoresponsive frameworks with reversibly and remotely controllable pores. We developed a topology&#8208;guided multicomponent polycondensation system that integrates protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units as photoresponsive sites on pore walls at predesigned densities, so that a series of crystalline porous frameworks with the same backbone can be constructed to develop a broad spectrum of pores ranging from mesopores to micropores. Distinct from conventional azobenzene&#8208;based systems, the tetrafluoroazobenzene frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights to undergo high&#8208;rate isomerization. The photoisomerization exerts profound effects on pore size, shape, number, and environment, as well as molecular uptake and release, rendering the system able to convert and switch pores reversibly and remotely with visible lights. Our results open a way to a novel class of smart porous materials with pore structures and functions that are convertible and manageable with visible lights.

         <title>Air&#8208;Promoted Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production from Bioethanol over Core/Shell Cr2O3@GaN Nanoarchitecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air is explored as a promoter rather than quencher for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from bioethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture, showing an impressive H2 evolution rate by only feeding ethanol, air, and light without notable degradation over 180&#8197;hours operation. Value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds are simultaneously generated.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from biomass derivatives offers a path towards carbon neutrality. It is often however operated with the limitations of sluggish kinetics and severe coking. Herein, a disruptive air&#8208;promoted strategy is explored for efficient and durable light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from ethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture. The correlative computational and experimental investigations show ethanol is energetically favorable to be adsorbed on the Cr2O3@GaN interface, followed by dehydrogenation toward acetaldehyde and protons by photoexcited holes. The released protons are then consumed for H2 evolution by photogenerated electrons. Afterward, O2 can be evolved into active oxygen species and promote the deprotonation and C&#8722;C cleavage of the key C2 intermediate, thus significantly lowering the reaction energy barrier of hydrogen evolution and removing the carbon residual with inhibited overoxidation. Consequently, hydrogen is produced at a high rate of 76.9&#8197;mole H2 per gram Cr2O3@GaN per hour by only feeding ethanol, air, and light, leading to the achievement of a turnover number of 266,943,000&#8197;mole H2 per mole Cr2O3 over a long&#8208;term operation of 180&#8197;hours. Notably, an unprecedented light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 17.6&#8201;% is achieved under concentrated light illumination. The simultaneous generation of aldehyde from ethanol dehydrogenation enables the process more economically promising.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Two&#8208;dimensional Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by voltage&#8208;gated ion channels in neurons, a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor was fabricated, which operates based on the response to transmembrane potential. The device demonstrates a high on/off ratio of ~2000 and can transition from ambipolar to unipolar behavior with a low subthreshold swing of 560&#8197;mV/decade. The successful implementation of ionic logic gate circuits, including &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, and &#8220;NOR&#8221; gates, paves a promising pathway towards ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels prevalent in neurons play important roles in generating action potential and information transmission by responding to transmembrane potential. Fabricating bio&#8208;inspired ionic transistors with ions as charge carriers will be crucial for realizing neuro&#8208;inspired devices and brain&#8208;liking computing. Here, we reported a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor based on a MXene membrane with sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm interlayer channels. By applying a gating voltage on the MXene nanofluidic, a transmembrane potential will be generated to active the ionic transistor, which is similar to the transmembrane potential of neuron cells and can be effectively regulated by changing membrane parameters, e.g., thickness, composition, and interlayer spacing. For the symmetric MXene nanofluidic, a high on/off ratio of ~2000 can be achieved by forming an ionic depletion or accumulation zone, contingent on the sign of the gating potential. An asymmetric PET/MXene&#8208;composited nanofluidic transitioned the ionic transistor from ambipolar to unipolar, resulting in a more sensitive gate voltage characteristic with a low subthreshold swing of 560&#8197;mV/decade. Furthermore, ionic logic gate circuits, including the &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, and &#8220;NOR&#8221; gate, were implemented for neuromorphic signal processing successfully, which provides a promising pathway towards highly parallel, low energy consumption, and ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.

         <title>&#8220;Zero&#8221; Intrinsic Fluorescence Sensing&#8208;Platforms Enable Ultrasensitive Whole Blood Diagnosis and In Vivo Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
The present work reports a versatile strategy involving engineering long&#8208;wavelength rhodol derivatives by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms, thereby aiding in eliminating probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF) of far&#8208;red to NIR II probes and creating ultra&#8208;sensitive fluorescence probes with a robust turn&#8208;on response (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). These novel probes enable accurate detection and quantification of biomarkers in abnormal physiological processes (p53 abnormalities) and diseases (tumor metastases).







Abstract
Abnormal physiological processes and diseases can lead to content or activity fluctuations of biocomponents in organelles and whole blood. However, precise monitoring of these abnormalities remains extremely challenging due to the insufficient sensitivity and accuracy of available fluorescence probes, which can be attributed to the background fluorescence arising from two sources, 1) biocomponent autofluorescence (BCAF) and 2) probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF). To overcome these obstacles, we have re&#8208;engineered far&#8208;red to NIR II rhodol derivatives that possess weak BCAF interference. And a series of &#8220;zero&#8221; PIF sensing&#8208;platforms were created by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms. Leveraging these advancements, we devised various ultra&#8208;sensitive NIR indicators, achieving substantial fluorescence boosts (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). Among these indicators, 8&#8208;LAP demonstrated accurate tracking and quantifying of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in whole blood at various stages of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, coupling 8&#8208;LAP with an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting element enabled the detection of ERAP1 activity in HCT116 cells with p53 abnormalities. This delicate design of eliminating PIF provides insights into enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of existing fluorescence probes toward the detection and imaging of biocomponents in abnormal physiological processes and diseases.

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Sensor Array Formed by Poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Fluorophores for Sensitive Multiplexed Bacterial Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor array, assembled from poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) complexes through electrostatic interactions, facilitates the detection of bacteria at low concentrations. This versatile approach significantly enhances the sensitivity of sensing systems, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics.







Abstract
Bacterial infections have emerged as the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;channel fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor array, comprising six electrostatic complexes formed from one negatively charged poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and six positively charged aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores. The 6&#8208;element array enabled the simultaneous identification of 20&#8197;bacteria (OD600=0.005) within 30s (99.0&#8201;% accuracy), demonstrating significant advantages over the array constituted by the 7 separate elements that constitute the complexes. Meanwhile, the array realized different mixing ratios and quantitative detection of prevalent bacteria associated with urinary tract infection (UTI). It also excelled in distinguishing six simulated bacteria samples in artificial urine. Remarkably, the limit of detection for E. coli and E. faecalis was notably low, at 0.000295 and 0.000329 (OD600), respectively. Finally, optimized by diverse machine learning algorithms, the designed array achieved 96.7&#8201;% accuracy in differentiating UTI clinical samples from healthy individuals using a random forest model, demonstrating the great potential for medical diagnostic applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Tolerant Superbase Polyoxometalate [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722; for Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a lowly&#8208;protonated hexaniobate cluster with Lindqvist structure by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis. The proton abstraction from substrates with pKa&gt;26 and from a base indicator with pKa=26.5 revealed the superbase property of [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722;. The catalytic activity for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions maintained even in the presence of water. We reported for the first time TBA6[H2(Nb6O19)] as a water&#8208;tolerant superbase catalyst among the basic metal oxide catalysts.







Abstract
Here, doubly protonated Lindqvist&#8208;type niobium oxide cluster [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8211;, fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis, exhibited superbase catalysis for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions accompanied by activating C&#8722;H bond with pKa &gt;26 and proton abstraction from a base indicator with pKa=26.5. Surprisingly, [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722; exhibited water&#8208;tolerant superbase properties for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions in the presence of water, although it is well known that the strong basicity of metal oxides and organic superbase is typically lost by the adsorption of water. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the basic surface oxygens that share the corner of NbO6 units in [H2(Nb6O19)]8&#8722; maintained the negative charges even after proton adsorption. This proton capacity and the presence of un&#8208;protonated basic sites led to the water tolerance of the superbase catalysis.

         <title>A Novel Homoconjugated Propellane Triimide: Synthesis, Structural Analyses, and Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel homoconjugated propellane comprising three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane, has been synthesized and characterized. This rigid propellane triimide is featured with large bathochromic shift, intense luminescence, amplified molar absorptivity, and lower reduction potential relative to the subunits. The propellane triimide readily crystallizes into porous 3D superstructure, which is promising for C2H6/C2H4 separation.







Abstract
Rigid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polycyclic propellanes have garnered interest due to their unique conformational spaces, which display great potential use in selectivity, separation and as models to study through&#8208;space electronic interactions. Herein we report the synthesis of a novel rigid propellane, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane triimide, which comprises three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane. This propellane triimide exhibits large bathochromic shift, amplified molar absorptivity, enhanced fluorescence, and lower reduction potential when compared to the subunits. Computational and experimental studies reveal that the effective through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;orbitals interacting (homoconjugation) occurs between the subunits. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis reveals that the propellane triimide has a highly quasi&#8208;D3h symmetric skeleton and readily crystallizes into different superstructures by changing alkyl chains at the imide positions. In particular, the porous 3D superstructure with S&#8208;shaped channels is promising for taking up ethane (C2H6) with very good selectivity over ethylene (C2H4), which can purify C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 in a single separation step. This work showcases a new class of rare 3D polycyclic propellane with intriguing electronic and supramolecular properties.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Linker Strategy for the Construction of Sulfone&#8208;Containing D&#8211;A&#8211;A Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

         <dc:description>
Sulfone&#8208;containing D&#8211;A&#8211;A covalent organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized via a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to facilitate charge transport and surface reactions with water. High photocatalytic H2O2 production activity was achieved to create solutions that can be used directly for the degradation of organic pollutants.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen using semiconductor catalysts offers a promising approach for converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production is often restricted by the low photo&#8208;generated charge separation, slow surface reactions and inadequate stability. Here, we developed a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to build a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8211;A) type covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF. The FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF structure features extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation that improves charge mobility, while the introduction of sulfone units not only as active sites facilitates surface reactions with water but also bolsters stability through increased interlayer forces. The resulting FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF has a low exciton binding energy, long excited&#8208;state lifetime and high photo&#8208;stability that leads to high performance for photocatalytic H2O2 production (up to 1.0&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) with an H2O2 output of 19&#8197;mM after 72&#8197;hours of irradiation. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates high stability, which sustained activity over 192&#8197;hours of photocatalytic experiment.

         <title>Dynamic Reversible Full&#8208;Color Piezochromic Fluorogens Featuring Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and their Application as X&#8208;Ray Imaging Scintillators</title>

         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters demonstrate dynamic reversible piezochromic luminescent (PCL) behavior by the modulation of inter/intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, and their single crystals exhibit full&#8208;color PCL process spanning a wide range of 170 nm at high pressure. These TADF emitters also show radioluminescence, with promising potential in X&#8208;ray scintillator imaging.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) can be excellent candidates for piezochromic luminescent (PCL) materials due to their structural dynamics. Spatial donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) stacking arrangements enable the modulation of inter&#8208; and intramolecular D&#8722;A interactions, as well as spatial charge transfer states, under varying pressure conditions. Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach toward dynamic reversible full&#8208;color PCL materials with TSCT&#8208;TADF characteristics. Their single crystals exhibit a full&#8208;color&#8208;gamut PCL process spanning a range of 170&#8197;nm. Moreover, the TSCT&#8208;TADF&#8208;PCL emitters display a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and show promising application in X&#8208;ray scintillator imaging.

         <title>Regulating Hydrogen/Oxygen Species Adsorption via Built&#8208;in Electric Field &#8208;Driven Electron Transfer Behavior at the Heterointerface for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work&#8208;function difference&#8208;induced formation of BEF can drive the asymmetrical charge distribution of heterostructure WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalysts through electronic transfer behaviors and manipulate the d band structure of active sites, thereby optimizing intermediate adsorption energy and accelerating reaction kinetics of the overall water splitting process.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) plays a crucial role in the realization of a hydrogen economy. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal to achieving high&#8208;efficiency AWE. Herein, WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon nanofiber (WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF) with abundant interfaces is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the electron transfer behavior from Mo2C to WC1&#8208;x, the electrocatalysts of WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF exhibit superior HER and OER performance. Furthermore, when employed as anode and cathode in membrane electrode assembly devices, the WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and remarkable stability for 100&#8197;hours at a high current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 towards overall water splitting. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulation reveal that modulation of the d&#8208;band center for WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF, achieved through the asymmetric charge distribution resulting from the built&#8208;in electric field induced by work function, enables optimization of adsorption strength for hydrogen/oxygen intermediates, thereby promoting the catalytic kinetics for overall water splitting. This work provides promising strategies for designing highly active catalysts in energy conversion fields.

         <title>Connections to the Electrodes Control the Transport Mechanism in Single&#8208;Molecule Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;transport mechanism in a single&#8208;molecule transistor can be changed from &#8216;particle&#8208;like hopping&#8217; to &#8216;wave&#8208;like&#8217; by changing the chemical structure of the molecule&#8211;electrode interface.







Abstract
When designing a molecular electronic device for a specific function, it is necessary to control whether the charge&#8208;transport mechanism is phase&#8208;coherent transmission or particle&#8208;like hopping. Here we report a systematic study of charge transport through single zinc&#8208;porphyrin molecules embedded in graphene nanogaps to form transistors, and show that the transport mechanism depends on the chemistry of the molecule&#8211;electrode interfaces. We show that van der Waals interactions between molecular anchoring groups and graphene yield transport characteristic of Coulomb blockade with incoherent sequential hopping, whereas covalent molecule&#8211;electrode amide bonds give intermediately or strongly coupled single&#8208;molecule devices that display coherent transmission. These findings demonstrate the importance of interfacial engineering in molecular electronic circuits.

         <title>Engineering Anti&#8208;CRISPR Proteins to Create CRISPR&#8208;Cas Protein Switches for Activatable Genome Editing and Viral Protease Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of orthogonal protease&#8208;responsive Cas12a protein switches are presented by leveraging Anti&#8208;CRISPR proteins as modular components under the rational guidance of computational chemistry&#8208;directed protein interface engineering. The protein switches facilitate the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function high switching ratios, allowing activatable genome editing and sensitive viral protease detection.







Abstract
Proteins capable of switching between distinct active states in response to biochemical cues are ideal for sensing and controlling biological processes. Activatable CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems are significant in precise genetic manipulation and sensitive molecular diagnostics, yet directly controlling Cas protein function remains challenging. Herein, we explore anti&#8208;CRISPR (Acr) proteins as modules to create synthetic Cas protein switches (CasPSs) based on computational chemistry&#8208;directed rational protein interface engineering. Guided by molecular fingerprint analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, and binding free energy calculations, we rationally engineer the molecular interaction interface between Cas12a and its cognate Acr proteins (AcrVA4 and AcrVA5) to generate a series of orthogonal protease&#8208;responsive CasPSs. These CasPSs enable the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function with high switching ratios (up to 34.3&#8208;fold). These advancements enable specific proteolysis&#8208;inducible genome editing in mammalian cells and sensitive detection of viral protease activities during virus infection. This work provides a promising strategy for developing CRISPR&#8208;Cas tools for controllable gene manipulation and regulation and clinical diagnostics.

A robust shield emerges on perovskite, crafted through the dance of nucleophilic addition, coordination, and polymerization with triphenylmethane triisocyanate. A high&#8208;melting&#8208;point organic promoter for air&#8208;doping bars ion diffusion in the transport layer. This duet yields &gt;25&#8201;% efficient n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells, basking in operational stability at 65&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide serves as the optimal light&#8208;absorbing layer in single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells. However, achieving operational stability of high&#8208;efficiency n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices at elevated temperatures remains challenging. In this work, we implemented effective surface modifications on microcrystalline perovskite films. This involved the nucleophilic addition of formamidinium cations and coordination of residual PbI2 with triphenylmethane triisocyanate as well as subsequent polymerization. The in situ growth of a cross&#8208;linking network chemically anchored on the perovskite film in this approach effectively reduced trap densities, favorably altered surface work function, suppressing interface charge recombination and thus enhancing cell efficiency. Coupled with a high&#8208;melting&#8208;point air&#8208;doping promoter, we fabricated n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells surpassing 25&#8201;% efficiency, demonstrating excellent operational stability at 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Efficient Homolytic Cleavage of H2O2 on Hydroxyl&#8208;Enriched Spinel CuFe2O4 with Dual Lewis Acid Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic electron transfer (MET) is indispensable during the traditional H2O2 cleavage process. We demonstrate a non&#8208;redox hydroxyl&#8208;enriched spinel CuFe2O4 with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 without MET, which truly promotes H2O2 utilization and the catalyst stability, thereby expanding the applicability of heterogeneous catalysts in environmental remediation and organic synthesis.







Abstract
Traditional H2O2 cleavage mediated by macroscopic electron transfer (MET) not only has low utilization of H2O2, but also sacrifices the stability of catalysts. We present a non&#8208;redox hydroxyl&#8208;enriched spinel (CuFe2O4) catalyst with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H2O2. The results of systematic experiments, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations confirm that tetrahedral Cu sites with optimal Lewis acidity and strong electron delocalization can synergistically elongate the O&#8722;O bonds (1.47&#8197;&#197; &#8594; 1.87&#8197;&#197;) in collaboration with adjacent bridging hydroxyl (another Lewis acid site). As a result, the free energy of H2O2 homolytic cleavage is decreased (1.28&#8197;eV &#8594; 0.98&#8197;eV). H2O2 can be efficiently split into &#8901;OH induced by hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 without MET, which greatly improves the catalyst stability and the H2O2 utilization (65.2&#8201;%, nearly 2 times than traditional catalysts). The system assembled with hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 and H2O2 affords exceptional performance for organic pollutant elimination. The scale&#8208;up experiment using a continuous flow reactor realizes long&#8208;term stability (up to 600&#8197;mL), confirming the tremendous potential of hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 for practical applications.

         <title>Activation of Ga Liquid Catalyst with Continuously Exposed Active Sites for Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and N2 to generate urea was successfully achieved by synthesising a new carbon&#8208;coated liquid alloy, Ga79Cu11Mo10@C, in which the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the active sites of Ga. Its flowability allows continuous exposure of the internal high&#8208;density active sites, while the deformability enhances the stability and toxicity resistance of the catalyst.







Abstract
Environmentally friendly electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and N2 for urea synthesis is a promising strategy. However, it is still facing problems such as low yield as well as low stability. Here, a new carbon&#8208;coated liquid alloy catalyst, Ga79Cu11Mo10@C is designed for efficient electrochemical urea synthesis by activating Ga active sites. During the N2 and CO2 co&#8208;reduction process, the yield of urea reaches 28.25&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is the highest yield reported so far under the same conditions, the Faraday efficiency (FE) is also as high as 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent stability under 100&#8197;h of testing. Comprehensive analyses showed that sequential exposure of a high density of active sites promoted the adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 for efficient coupling reactions. This coupling reaction occurs through a thermodynamic spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO to form a C&#8722;N bond. The deformability of the liquid state facilitates catalyst recovery and enhances stability and resistance to poisoning. Moreover, the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the Ga active sites, which successfully synthesises the *NCON* intermediate. The reaction energy barrier of the third proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) *NHCONH&#8594;*NHCONH2 was lowered, ensuring the efficient synthesis of urea.

         <title>Singlet Fission in a New Series of Systematically Designed Through&#8208;space Coupled Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of through&#8208;space tetracene oligomers demonstrates sub&#8208;picosecond singlet fission, as revealed by femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. These oligomers exhibit a remarkably high yield of the triplet pair state, a characteristic seldom observed in tetracene derivatives owing to the unfavorable energetics associated with their singlet and triplet energy levels.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) holds great promise for current photovoltaic technologies, where tetracenes, with their relatively high triplet energies, play a major role for application in silicon&#8208;based solar cells. However, the SF efficiencies in tetracene dimers are low due to the unfavorable energetics of their singlet and triplet energy levels. In the solid state, tetracene exhibits high yields of triplet formation through SF, raising great interest about the underlying mechanisms. To address this discrepancy, we designed and prepared a novel molecular system based on a hexaphenylbenzene core decorated with 2 to 6 tetracene chromophores. The spatial arrangement of tetracene units, induced by steric hindrance in the central part, dictates through&#8208;space coupling, making it a relevant model for solid&#8208;state chromophore organization. We then revealed a remarkable increase in SF quantum yield with the number of tetracenes, reaching quantitative (196&#8201;%) triplet pair formation in hexamer. We observed a short&#8208;lived correlated triplet pair and limited magnetic effects, indicating ineffective triplet dissociation in these through&#8208;space coupled systems. These findings emphasize the crucial role of the number of chromophores involved and the interchromophore arrangement for the SF efficiency. The insights gained from this study will aid designing more efficient and technology&#8208;compatible SF systems for applications in photovoltaics.

         <title>Hierarchically Responsive Alternating Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Tailored Interparticle Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the self&#8208;assembly of binary inorganic NPs into hierarchically pH&#8208;responsive alternating copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures with tailored interaction &#8220;bonds&#8221;. The &#8220;bond&#8221; length (i.e., the interparticle distance), and &#8220;bond&#8221; breakage and reformation can be precisely yet reversibly controlled by adjusting the pH of the solution. This enables us to reversibly tune the structures and optical response of the copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is an essential tool for constructing structured materials with a wide range of applications. However, achieving ordered assembly structures with externally programmable properties in binary NP systems remains challenging. In this work, we assemble binary inorganic NPs into hierarchically pH&#8208;responsive alternating copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures in an aqueous medium by engineering the interparticle electrostatic interactions. The polymer&#8208;grafted NPs bearing opposite charges are viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;), and copolymerized into alternating nano&#8208;copolymers (ANCPs) driven by the formation of interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221; between nanomers. The resulting ANCPs exhibit reversibly responsive &#8220;bond&#8221; length (i.e., the distance between nanomers) in response to the variation of pH in a range of ~7&#8211;10, allowing precise control over the surface plasmon resonance of ANCPs. Moreover, specific interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221; can break up at pH&#8805;11, leading to the dis&#8208;assembly of ANCPs into molecule&#8208;like dimers and trimers. These dimeric and trimeric structures can reassemble to form ANCPs owing to the resuming of interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221;, when the pH value of the solution changes from 11 to 7. The hierarchically responsive nanostructures may find applications in such as biosensing, optical waveguide, and electronic devices.

         <title>Circular Dichroism Sensing: Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical sensing of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric ratio and concentration of organic compounds has developed into a mature field with practical applications, including high&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction screening and chromatography&#8208;free analysis of multicompound mixtures. This review covers fundamental milestones and highlights recent advances with machine learning assistance, chemometric data processing and other developments.







Abstract
The analysis of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition, and concentration of chiral compounds are frequently encountered tasks across the chemical and health sciences. Chiroptical sensing methods can streamline this work and allow high&#8208;throughput screening with remarkable reduction of operational time and cost. During the last few years, significant methodological advances with innovative chirality sensing systems, the use of computer&#8208;generated calibration curves, machine learning assistance, and chemometric data processing, to name a few, have emerged and are now matched with commercially available multi&#8208;well plate CD readers. These developments have reframed the chirality sensing space and provide new opportunities that are of interest to a large group of chemists. This review will discuss chirality sensing strategies and applications with representative small&#8208;molecule CD sensors. Emphasis will be given to important milestones and recent advances that accelerate chiral compound analysis by outperforming traditional methods, conquer new directions, and pioneering efforts that lie at the forefront of chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening developments. The goal is to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the current state and a perspective of future directions of this rapidly emerging field.

         <title>Converting Commercial Zn Foils into Single (002)&#8208;Textured Zn with Millimeter&#8208;Sized Grains for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and fast melting&#8208;solidification approach was developed to effectively convert commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zinc with millimeter&#8208;sized (eye&#8208;visible) grains. The single (002) texture and huge grain features ensure large&#8208;scale epitaxial Zn deposition and significantly minimize the intergranular reactions, resulting in impressive reversibility of Zn metal anode in both Zn||Zn symmetric cells and full cells.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are promising but hindered by unfavorable dendrite growth and side reactions on zinc anodes. In this study, we demonstrate a fast melting&#8208;solidification approach for effectively converting commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zn featuring millimeter&#8208;sized grains. The melting process eliminates initial texture, residual stress, and grain size variations in diverse commercial Zn foils, guaranteeing the uniformity of commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zn. The single (002)&#8208;texture ensures large&#8208;scale epitaxial and dense Zn deposition, while the reduction in grain boundaries significantly minimizes intergranular reactions. These features enable large grain single (002)&#8208;textured Zn shows planar and dense Zn deposition under harsh conditions (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), impressive reversibility in Zn||Zn symmetric cell (3280&#8197;h under 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 830&#8197;h under 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and long cycling stability over 180&#8197;h with a high depth of discharge value of 75&#8201;%. This study successfully addresses the issue of uncontrollable texture formation in Zn foils following routine annealing treatments with temperatures below the Zn melting point. The findings of this study establish a highly efficient strategy for fabricating highly reversible single (002)&#8208;textured Zn anodes.

         <title>Functional Selection of Tau Oligomerization&#8208;Inhibiting Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aptamer selection method (Functional Selection) has identified a DNA aptamer, BW1c, with high specificity and affinity binding to Tau protein, representing a new avenue for inhibiting Tau protein aggregation. This strategy shows a &#8220;fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose&#8221; selection workflow for discovery of aptamers with desired functionality.







Abstract
Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule&#8208;associated Tau protein contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other related tauopathies. Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer's Disease. Aptamers offer significant potential as next&#8208;generation therapeutics in biotechnology and the treatment of neurological disorders. Traditional aptamer selection methods for Tau protein focus on binding affinity rather than interference with pathological Tau. In this study, we developed a new selection strategy to enrich DNA aptamers that bind to surviving monomeric Tau protein under conditions that would typically promote Tau aggregation. Employing this approach, we identified a set of aptamer candidates. Notably, BW1c demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd=6.6&#8197;nM) to Tau protein and effectively inhibits arachidonic acid (AA)&#8208;induced Tau protein oligomerization and aggregation. Additionally, it inhibits GSK3&#946;&#8208;mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cell&#8208;free systems and okadaic acid&#8208;mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cellular milieu. Lastly, retro&#8208;orbital injection of BW1c tau aptamer shows the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and gain access to neuronal cell body. Through further refinement and development, these Tau aptamers may pave the way for a first&#8208;in&#8208;class neurotherapeutic to mitigate tauopathy&#8208;associated neurodegenerative disorders.

         <title>Portably and Visually Sensing Cytisine through Smartphone Scanning Based on a Post&#8208;Modified Luminescence Center Strategy in Zinc&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emissive luminescent sensor Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 was synthesized by immobilizing Tb3+ in a new metal&#8211;organic framework, which showed high sensitivity and selectivity for cytisine in the luminescence detection. After fabricating Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 as a membrane sensor, M&#8722;Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 exhibited a luminescent color change during cytisine detection. This visual change, recognizable by smartphone scanning, enables portable detection of cytisine.







Abstract
Cytisine (CTS) is a useful medicine for treating nervous disorders and smoking addiction, and exploring a convenient method to detect CTS is of great significance for long&#8208;term/home medication to avoid the risk of poisoning, but it is full of challenges. Here, a modified metal&#8211;organic framework sensor Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 with dual emission centers was prepared using a post&#8208;modified luminescence center strategy. The obtained Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 can serve as a CTS sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. To achieve portable detection, Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 was further fabricated as a membrane sensor, M&#8722;Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80, which displayed an obvious CTS&#8208;responsive color change by simply dropping a CTS solution onto its surface. Benefiting from this unique functionality, M&#8722;Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 successfully realized the visual detection and quantitative monitoring of CTS in the range of 5.26&#8211;52.6&#8197;mM by simply scanning the color with a smartphone. The results of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and theoretical computation illustrated that the high sensing efficiency of Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 for CTS was attributed to the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the ligand and CTS. And luminescence quenching may result from the intramolecular charge transfer. This study provides a convenient method for ensuring long&#8208;term medication safety at home.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytisine (CTS) is a useful medicine for treating nervous disorders and smoking addiction, and exploring a convenient method to detect CTS is of great significance for long-term/home medication to avoid the risk of poisoning, but it is full of challenges. Here, a modified metal&#8211;organic framework sensor Tb@Zn-TDA-80 with dual emission centers was prepared using a post-modified luminescence center strategy. The obtained Tb@Zn-TDA-80 can serve as a CTS sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. To achieve portable detection, Tb@Zn-TDA-80 was further fabricated as a membrane sensor, M&#8722;Tb@Zn-TDA-80, which displayed an obvious CTS-responsive color change by simply dropping a CTS solution onto its surface. Benefiting from this unique functionality, M&#8722;Tb@Zn-TDA-80 successfully realized the visual detection and quantitative monitoring of CTS in the range of 5.26&#8211;52.6&#8197;mM by simply scanning the color with a smartphone. The results of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and theoretical computation illustrated that the high sensing efficiency of Tb@Zn-TDA-80 for CTS was attributed to the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the ligand and CTS. And luminescence quenching may result from the intramolecular charge transfer. This study provides a convenient method for ensuring long-term medication safety at home.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding Luminescence Horizons in Macropolyhedral Heteroboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An investigation of the new 18&#8208; and 19&#8208;vertex macropolyhedral heteroborane clusters reported here containing sulphur and selenium cluster vertices and a subsequent reinvestigation of analogous known species has revealed that the property of luminescence in this wide range of structural types is much more extensive than previously recognised, where it has been restricted to those of the binary borane anti&#8208;B18H22 and its derivatives.







Abstract
Luminescence is observed in three novel macropolyhedral nineteen&#8208; and eighteen&#8208;vertex chalcogenaboranes: Se2B17H17 (1), SeB17H19 (3) and SeB18H20 (4). This led us to the recognition that previously published macropolyhedral heteroborane species might also exhibit luminescence. Thus, the known nineteen&#8208; and eighteen&#8208;vertex dithiaboranes S2B17H17 (2), n&#8208;S2B16H16 (5) and i&#8208;S2B16H16 (6) were synthesised and also found to exhibit a range of luminescent properties. These macropolyhedral species are very different from the previously unique fluorescent binary borane B18H22 in terms of their structural architectures, by the presence of borane cluster hetero atoms, and, as in the cases of 5 and 6, that their synthetic origins are not derived simply through the modification of B18H22 itself. They consequently greatly expand the possibilities of finding new luminescent inorganic borane species.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expanding Difluorination: An Enantioselective Platform to Access &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Difluorinated Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;carbonyl compounds have a venerable history as drug discovery leads, but limitations in the synthesis arsenal continue to impede chemical space exploration. This challenge is particularly acute in the arena of fluorinated medium rings where installing the difluoromethylene unit subtly alters the ring conformation by expanding the internal angle (&#8736;C&#8208;CF2&#8208;C &gt; &#8736;C&#8208;CH2&#8208;C): this provides a handle to modulate physicochemistry (e.g. pKa). To reconcile this disparity, a highly modular ring expansion has been devised that leverages simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides, and processes them to one&#8208;carbon homologated rings with concomitant geminal difluorination (6 to 10 membered rings, up to 95% yield). This process is a rare example of the formal difluorination of an internal alkene and is enabled by sequential I(III)&#8208;enabled O&#8208;activation. Validation of enantioselective catalysis in the generation of unprecedented medium ring scaffolds is reported (up to 93:7 e.r.) together with X&#8208;ray structural analyses and product derivatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Li3PO4&#8208;Enriched SEI on Graphite Anode Boosts Li+ De&#8208;Solvation Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li+ de&#8208;solvation at solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;electrolyte interface stands as a pivotal step that imposes limitations on the fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unraveling the contributions of key constituents in the SEI that facilitate Li+ de&#8208;solvation and deciphering their mechanisms, as a design principle for the interphasial structure of anode materials, is still a challenge. Herein, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by various inorganic components (Li2CO3, LiF, Li3PO4) found in the SEI on their role in promoting the Li+ de&#8208;solvation. The findings highlight that Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI effectively reduces the de&#8208;solvation energy due to its ability to attenuate the Li+&#8208;solvent interaction, thereby expediting the de&#8208;solvation process. Building on this, we engineer Li3PO4 interphase on graphite (LPO&#8208;Gr) anode via a simple solid&#8208;phase coating, facilitating the Li+ de&#8208;solvation and building an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, resulting in accelerated Li+ transport crossing the electrode interfaces and interphases. Full cells using the LPO&#8208;Gr anode can replenish its 80% capacity in 6.5 minutes, while still retaining 70% of the room temperature capacity even at &#8208;20 &#176;C. Our strategy establishes connection between the de&#8208;solvation characteristics of the SEI components and the interphasial design of anode materials for high performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming of Supercrystals Using Replicable DNA&#8208;Functionalized Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of self&#8208;replicating systems is of great importance in research on the origin of life. As the most iconic molecules, nucleic acids have provided prominent examples of the fabrication of self&#8208;replicating artificial nanostructures. However, it is still challenging to construct sophisticated synthetic systems that can create large&#8208;scale or three&#8208;dimensionally ordered nanomaterials using self&#8208;replicating nanostructures. By integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem to produce DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies, we developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner. The replication efficiency and crystal quality of the resulting superlattice structures can be effectively increased by regulating the molar ratio of the template to the copy colloids. By constructing binary systems from two types of gold nanoparticles (or proteins), superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained through the replication and catalytic assembly processes. This programmable enthalpy&#8208;mediated approach was easily leveraged to achieve the phase transformation and catalytic amplification of colloidal crystals starting from different initial template crystals. This work offers a potential way to construct self&#8208;replicating artificial systems that exhibit complicated phase behaviors and can produce large&#8208;scale superlattice nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Terminal Oxazole&#8208;Bearing Natural Products by a Targeted Metabologenomic Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A targeted metabologenomic method was developed to selectively discover terminal oxazole&#8208;bearing natural products from bacteria. For this, genes encoding oxazole cyclase, a key enzyme in terminal oxazole biosynthesis, were chosen as the genomic signature to screen bacterial strains that may produce oxazole&#8208;bearing compounds. Sixteen strains were identified from the screening of a bacterial DNA library (1,000 strains) using oxazole cyclase gene&#8208;targeting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. The PCR amplicon sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and classified into nine clades. 1H&#8211;13C coupled&#8208;HSQC NMR spectra obtained from the culture extracts of the hit strains enabled the unequivocal detection of the target compounds, including five new oxazole compounds, based on the unique 1JCH values and chemical shifts of oxazole: lenzioxazole (1) possessing an unprecedented cyclopentane, permafroxazole (2) bearing a tetraene conjugated with carboxylic acid, tenebriazine (3) incorporating two modified amino acids, and methyl&#8208;oxazolomycins A and B (4 and 5). Tenebriazine displayed inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi, whereas methyl&#8208;oxazolomycins A and B (4 and 5) selectively showed anti&#8208;proliferative activity against estrogen receptor&#8208;positive breast cancer cells. This metabologenomic method enables the logical and efficient discovery of new natural microbial products with a target structural motif without the need for isotopic labeling.</dc:description>

         <title>6&#8208;Strand to Stable 10/12 Helix Conformational Switch by Incorporating Flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly in the Homooligomers of Camphor Derived &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: NMR and X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Evidence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of unnatural amino acid building blocks capable of stabilizing predictable secondary structures similar to protein fragments is pivotal for foldamer chemistry/catalysis. Here, we introduce novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks:&#160; [1S,2R,4R]exoCDA and [1S,2S,4R]endoCDA, derived from the abundantly available R(+)&#8208;camphor, which is traditionally known for its medicinal value. Further, we demonstrate that the homooligomers of exoCDA adopt 6&#8208;strand conformation, which switches to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix simply by inserting flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly spacer at alternate positions (1:1 &#946;&#8208;hGly/exoCDA heterooligomers), as evident by DFT&#8208;calculations, solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of crystalline&#8208;state structure of left&#8208;handed 10/12&#8208;mixed helix, that is free from the conventional approach of employing &#946;&#8208;amino acids of either alternate chirality or alternate &#946;2/&#946;3 substitutions, to access the 10/12&#8208;helix. The results also show that the homooligomers of heterochiral exoCDA don't adopt helical fold, instead exhibit banana&#8208;shaped strands, whereas the homodimers of the other diastereomer endoCDA, nucleate 8&#8208;membered turns.&#160;&#160; Furthermore, the homo&#8208;exoCDA and hetero&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;hGly&#8208;exoCDA] oligomers are found to exhibit self&#8208;association properties with distinct morphological features. Overall, the results offer new possibilties of constructing discrete stable secondary and tertiary structures based on CDAs, which can accommodate flexible residues with desired side&#8208;chain substitutions.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA Control via Redox&#8208;Responsive Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive components into RNA constructs provides precise spatiotemporal control over RNA structures and functions. Despite considerable advancements, the utilization of redox&#8208;responsive stimuli for the activation of caged RNAs remains scarce. In this context, we present a novel strategy that leverages post&#8208;synthetic acylation coupled with redox&#8208;responsive chemistry to exert reversible control over RNA. To achieve this, we design and synthesize a series of acylating reagents specifically tailored for introducing disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts into the 2&#8217;&#8208;OH groups of RNA (&#8220;cloaking&#8221;). Our data reveal that these acyl moieties can be readily appended, effectively blocking RNA catalytic activity and folding. We also demonstrate the traceless release and reactivation of caged RNAs (&#8220;uncloaking&#8221;) through reducing stimuli. By employing this strategy, RNA exhibits rapid cellular uptake, effective distribution and activation in the cytosol without lysosomal entrapment. We anticipate that our methodology will be accessible to laboratories engaged in RNA biology and holds promise as a versatile platform for RNA&#8208;based applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Dearomative Partial Reduction of Benzenoid Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative partial reduction is an extraordinary approach for transforming benzenoid arenes and has been well&#8208;known for many decades, as demonstrated by the dihydrogenation in Birch reduction and the hydroarylation in Crich addition. Despite its significant importance in synthesis, this field has experienced slow progress over the last half&#8208;century. However, a revival has been observed with the recent introduction of electrochemical and photochemical methods. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements in dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, including dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, arylation, alkenylation, amination, borylation and others. Further, the intriguing utilization of dearomative partial reduction in the synthesis of natural products is also highlighted. It is anticipated that this Minireview will stimulate further progress in arene dearomative transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity Effects on the Reactivity of a Nonheme Iron (IV) Oxo Complex in C&#8208;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of substrate positioning and orientation (its proximity to the reactive unit) is often invoked to rationalize the superior enzymatic reaction rates and selectivities when compared to synthetic models. Artificial nonheme iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) complexes react with C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds via a biomimetic Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Hydroxyl Rebound mechanism, but rates, site&#8208;selectivity and even hydroxyl rebound efficiency (ligand rebound versus substrate radical diffusion) are smaller than in oxygenases. Herein, we quantitatively analyze how substrate binding modulates nonheme Fe(IV)=O reactivity by comparing rates and outcomes of C&#173;&#8208;H oxidation by a pair of Fe(IV)=O complexes that share the same first coordination sphere but only one contains a crown ether receptor that recognizes the substrate. Substrate binding makes the reaction intramolecular, exhibiting Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics and increased reaction rates. In addition, C&#8208;H oxidation occurs with high site selectivity for remote sites. Analysis of Effective Molarity reveals that the system operates at its maximal theoretical capability for the oxidation of these remote sites. Remarkably, substrate positioning also affects Hydroxyl Rebound, whose efficiency increases only on the sites placed in proximity by recognition. Overall, these observations provide evidence that supramolecular control of substrate positioning can effectively modulate the reactivity of oxygenases and its models.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterodyne&#8208;Detected Sum&#8208;Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Aqueous Molecular Structure at the Suspended Graphene/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene, a transparent two&#8208;dimensional conductive material, has brought extensive new perspectives and prospects to various aqueous technological systems, such as desalination membranes, chemical sensors, energy storage, and energy conversion devices. Yet, the molecular&#8208;level details of graphene in contact with aqueous electrolytes, such as water orientation and hydrogen bond structure, remain elusive or controversial. Here, we employ surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detection sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) vibrational spectroscopy to re&#8208;examine the water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface. We compare the response from the air/graphene/water system to that from the air/water interface. Our results indicate that the&#160;&#967;(2)yyz spectrum recorded from the air/graphene/water system arises from the topmost 1&#8208;2 water layers in contact with the graphene, with the graphene itself not generating a significant SFG response. Compared to the air/water interface response, the presence of monolayer graphene weakly affects the interfacial water. Graphene weakly affects the dangling O&#8208;H group, lowering its frequency through its interaction with the graphene sheet, and has a small effect on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8208;H group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. Our work provides molecular insight into the interfacial structure at a suspended graphene/water interface, relevant to various technological applications of graphene.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Stabilisation of Remarkably Bent Tetra&#8208;cationic Tetra&#8208;radical Intermolecular Fe(III) &#181;&#8208;oxo Tetranuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hitherto unknown series of air stable, &#960;&#8208;conjugated, remarkably bent tetra&#8208;cation tetra&#8208;radical intermolecular Fe(III) &#181;&#8208;oxo tetranuclear complex, isolated from the dication diradical diiron(III) porphyrin dimers, has been synthesised and spectroscopically characterised along with single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of two such molecules. These species facilitate long&#8208;range charge/radical delocalisation through the bridge across the entire tetranuclear unit manifesting an unusually intense NIR band. Assorted spin states of Fe(III) centres are stabilised within these unique tetranuclear frameworks: terminal six&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the admixed intermediate spin states while the central five&#8208;coordinate iron centres stabilise the high&#8208;spin states. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated strong antiferromagnetic coupling for the Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(III) unit while the exchange interactions between the Fe centres and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are weaker as supported both by magnetic data and DFT calculations. The nature of orbital overlap between the SOMOs of Fe(III) and &#960;* orbital of the porphyrin was found to rationalise the observed exchange coupling, establishing such a complex magnetic exchange in this tetranuclear model with a significant bioinorganic relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed p&#8208;Block Aluminum&#8208;Based Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main group metals are commonly perceived as catalytically inert in the context of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) due to the delocalized valence orbitals. Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;Nx) is a promising approach to accelerate catalytic dynamics. Herein, we, for the first time, report the atomically dispersed Al catalysts coordinated with N and C atoms for 4&#8208;electron ORR. The axial coordinated pyrrolyl N group (No) is constructed in the Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No moiety to regulate the p&#8208;band structure of Al center, effectively steering the local environment and structure of the square planar Al&#8208;N4 sites, which typically exhibit too strong interaction with ORR intermediates. The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. The as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability, along with the rapid kinetics as demonstrated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. This work offers a fundamental comprehension of the fine regulation on p&#8208;band and guides the rational design of main&#8208;group metal&#8208;based single atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>From Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2&#160;to&#160;Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2: Controlling Sulfur Content in&#160;Thiocyanate Systems Significantly Improves the Overall Performance of UV Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) effect (&gt;1&#215;KH2PO4&#160;(KDP)), a large bandgap (&gt;4.2 eV), and a moderate birefringence in ultraviolet (UV) NLO crystals remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, the first example of a thiocyanate capable of realizing a phase&#8208;matched UV NLO crystal material, is obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2. Compared to the "shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder" one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2&#160;has a different sawtooth 1D chain structure. Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2&#160;has second harmonic generation (SHG) inertia with a bandgap of 3.90 eV and a UV cutoff edge of 342 nm, however, it possesses a large birefringence (0.35@546 nm). In contrast, the symmetry center breaking of Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2&#160;leads to remarkably strong SHG intensity (10 times that of KDP). Furthermore, it has a wide bandgap (4.74 eV), short UV cutoff edge (234 nm), and moderate birefringence capable of phase matching (0.17@546 nm). This research indicates that thiocyanates are a promising class of UV NLO crystal materials, and that modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy for the development of UV NLO crystals with excellent overall performances.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Light&#8208;Generated Radicals for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion in an Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D&#160;Metal&#8208;Organic Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation is a promising strategy for clean water production, which need the development of solar&#8208;thermal conversion materials with both high efficiency and high stability. Herein, we reported an ultra&#8208;stable cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 with light&#8208;generated radicals, exhibiting superior photothermal conversion efficiency and high stability. Under the irradiation of 808 nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1 &#176;C in 6 seconds. The solar water evaporator based on NKU&#8208;123 achieves a high solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9 % for pure water and seawater, respectively. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the formation of light&#8208;generated radicals leads to an increase of spin density of NKU&#8208;123 for enhancing the photothermal effect, which provides insights into the design of highly efficient photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Organic Polar Molecules Tailored Electrode Interfaces for Stable Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are deemed as ones of the most promising energy storage devices for next electrification applications. However, the uneven Li electroplating process caused by the diffusion&#8208;limited Li+ transportation at the Li metal surface inherently promotes the formation of dendritic morphology and instable Li interphase, while the sluggish Li+ transfer kinetic can also cause lithiation&#8208;induced stress on the cathode materials suffering from serious structural stability. Herein, a novel electrolyte designing strategy is proposed to accelerate the Li+ transfer by introducing a trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate (LP) without significantly altering the electrolyte structure. The LP molecules can afford a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, enhancing both the bulk and interfacial Li+ transfer kinetic, and creating better anode/cathode interfaces to suppress the side reactions, resulting in much improved cycling efficiency of LMBs. Using LP&#8208;based electrolyte, the performance of LMB pouch cell with a practical capacity of ~1.5 Ah can be improved greatly. This strategy opens up a novel electrolyte designing route for reliable LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Fluorinated Lithium Borate Main Salt Empowering Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional lithium salts are difficult to meet practical application demand of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under high voltages and temperatures. LiPF6, as the most commonly used lithium salt, still suffers from notorious moisture sensitivity and inferior thermal stability under those conditions. Here, we synthesize a novel lithium salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) comprising highly&#8208;fluorinated and borate functional groups to address the above issues. It is demonstrated that the LiFPB shows superior thermal and electrochemical stability without any HF generation under high temperatures and voltages. In addition, the LiFPB can form a protective outer&#8208;organic and inner&#8208;inorganic rich cathode electrolyte interphase on LiCoO2 (LCO) surface. Simultaneously, the FPB&#8208; anions tend to integrate into lithium ion solvation structure to form a favorable fast&#8208;ion conductive LiBxOy based solid electrolyte interphase on lithium (Li) anode. All these fantastic features of LiFPB endow LCO (1.9 mAh cm&#8208;2)/Li metal cells excellent cycling under both high voltages and temperatures (e.g., 80% capacity retention after 260 cycles at 60 &#176;C and 4.45 V), and even at an extremely elevated temperature of 100 &#176;C. This work emphasizes the important role of salt anions in determining the electrochemical performance of LMBs at both high temperature and voltage conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Lithium Salt Molecule Tuning for Fast Charging/Discharging Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li+ transference number (T+) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self&#8208;folded lithium salt, lithium 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N&#8208;[2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self&#8208;folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8208;N bond (2.069 &#197;) is revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus the intensive interphase &#8220;self&#8208;cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra&#8208;thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8208;N is tuned from 2.069 &#197; in LiFEA to 4.367 &#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.</dc:description>

The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self-folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li-N bond (2.069 &#197;) is revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus the intensive interphase &#8220;self-cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra-thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron-withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li-N is tuned from 2.069 &#197; in LiFEA to 4.367 &#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self-cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peroxygenase Enabled Reductive Kinetic Resolution for the Enantioenrichment of Organoperoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantiomerically pure organoperoxides serve as valuable precursors in organic transformations. In this study, we present the first examples of unspecific peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic organoperoxides through asymmetric reduction. Through meticulous investigation of the reaction conditions, it is shown that the unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) exhibits robust catalytic activity in the kinetic resolution reactions of the model substrate with turnover numbers up to 60000 and turnover frequency of 5.6 s&#8208;1. Various aralkyl organoperoxides were successfully resolved by AaeUPO, achieving excellent enantioselectivities (e.g., up to 99% ee for the (S)&#8208;organoperoxide products). Additionally, we screened commercial peroxygenase variants to obtain the organoperoxides with complementary chirality, with one mutant yielding the (R)&#8208;products. While unspecific peroxygenases have been extensively demonstrated as a powerful oxidative catalyst, this work highlights its usefulness in catalyzing the reduction of organoperoxides and providing versatile chiral synthons.</dc:description>

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shift as a Probe for Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Existing modelling tools, developed to aid the design of efficient molecular wires and to better understand their charge&#8208;transport behaviour and mechanism, have limitations in accuracy and computational cost. Further research is required to develop faster and more precise methods that can yield information on how charge transport properties are impacted by changes in the chemical structure of a molecular wire. In this study, we report a clear semilogarithmic correlation between charge transport efficiency and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in multiple series of molecular wires, also accounting for the presence of chemical substituents. The NMR data was used to inform a simple tight&#8208;binding model that accurately captures the experimental single&#8208;molecule conductance values, especially useful in this case as more sophisticated density functional theory calculations fail due to inherent limitations. Our study demonstrates the potential of NMR spectroscopy as a valuable tool for characterising, rationalising, and gaining additional insights on the charge transport properties of single&#8208;molecule junctions.</dc:description>

         <title>How to Deal with Charge in the Ranking of Lewis Acidity: Critical Evaluation of an Extensive Set of Cationic Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quantification of Lewis acidity is of fundamental and applied importance in chemistry. However, if neutral and charged Lewis acids are compared, a coherent ranking has been elusive, and severe uncertainties were accepted. With this study, we present a systematic computational analysis of Lewis base affinities of 784 mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tricationic Lewis acids and their comparison with 149 representative neutral Lewis acids. Evaluating vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) reveals a charge&#8208;caused clustering that prohibits any meaningful ranking. Instead, solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv is identified as a metric that overcomes charge sensitivity in a balanced manner, allowing for a coherent evaluation of Lewis acidity across varying charge states. Analyzing the impact of molecular volume on solvation&#8208;induced FIA damping provides rationales for fundamental trends and guidelines for the choice or design of neutral and cationic Lewis acids in the condensed phase. Exploring alternative scales, explicit counteranion effects, and selected experimental case studies reaffirms the advantages of solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv as the most versatile and practical approach for the quantitative ranking of general (thermodynamic) Lewis acidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle and Single&#8208;Molecule Characterization of Immobilized Enzymes: A&#160;Multi&#8208;scale Path toward&#160;Optimizing Heterogeneous Biocatalysts.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous biocatalysis is highly relevant in biotechnology as it offers several benefits and practical uses. To leverage the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysts, the establishment of well&#8208;crafted protocols, and a deeper comprehension of enzyme immobilization on solid substrates are essential. These endeavors seek to optimize immobilized biocatalysts, ensuring maximal enzyme performance within confined spaces. To this aim, multidimensional characterization of heterogeneous biocatalysts is demanded. In this context, spectroscopic and microscopic methodologies conducted at different space and temporal scales can inform about the intraparticle enzyme kinetics, the enzyme spatial distribution, and mass transport issues. In this minireview, we identify enzyme immobilization, enzyme activity, and enzyme inactivation as the three fundamental processes for which advanced characterization tools unveil fundamental information. Recent advances in operando characterization of immobilized enzymes at the single&#8208;particle (SP) and single&#8208;molecule (SM) levels reveal valuable information on their functional properties unlocking the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysis toward biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8209;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) hold promise as sustainable alternatives to metal complexes in organic transformations. However, their working structure and dynamics remain poorly understood, hindering advances in their design.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of Cell&#8208;Surface Proteins via Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy by Using Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Directing the Encapsulation of Single Cells with DNA Framework Nucleator&#8208;Based Hydrogel Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a bio&#8208;inspired strategy for single&#8208;cell encapsulation by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator (DFN) to guide the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. The tetrahedral DFN could stably anchor on the cell membrane, resulting in a uniform and flexible cell encapsulation that persisted for 72&#8197;h. This encapsulation could maintain cell viability and protect cells against mechanical stress&#8208;induced autophagy.







Abstract
Encapsulating individual mammalian cells with biomimetic materials holds potential in ex vivo cell culture and engineering. However, current methodologies often present tradeoffs between homogeneity, stability, and cell compatibility. Here, inspired by bacteria that use proteins stably anchored on their outer membranes to nucleate biofilm growth, we develop a single&#8208;cell encapsulation strategy by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator (DFN) to initiate the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. We find that among the tested structures, the tetrahedral DFN can evenly and stably reside on cell membranes, effectively initiating hybridization chain reactions which generate homogeneously dense yet flexible single&#8208;cell encapsulation for diverse cell lines. The encapsulation persists for up to 72&#8197;hours in a serum&#8208;containing cell culture environment, representing a ~70&#8208;fold improvement compared to encapsulations mediated by single&#8208;stranded DNA nucleators. The metabolism and proliferation of the encapsulated cells are suppressed, but can be restored to the original efficiencies upon release, suggesting the superior cell compatibility of the encapsulation. We also find that compared to naked cells, the encapsulated cells exhibit a lower autophagy level after undergoing mechanical stress, suggesting the protective effect of the DNA encapsulation. This method may provide a new tool for ex vivo cell engineering.

         <title>COF&#8208;Topological Quantum Material Nano&#8208;heterostructure for CO2 to Syngas Production under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COF&#8208;topological quantum material (COF@TI) nano&#8208;heterostructure serves as an efficient catalyst for solar enegy driven syngas production with controllable ratios (CO: H2) from CO2 and H2O.







Abstract
Efficient solar&#8208;driven syngas production (CO+H2 mixture) from CO2 and H2O with a suitable photocatalyst and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism are the desired approach towards the carbon recycling process. Herein, we report the design and development of an unique COF&#8208;topological quantum material nano&#8208;heterostructure, COF@TI with a newly synthesized donor&#8208;acceptor based COF and two dimensional (2D) nanosheets of strong topological insulator (TI), PbBi2Te4. The intrinsic robust metallic surfaces of the TI act as electron reservoir, minimising the fast electron&#8208;hole recombination process, and the presence of 6s2 lone pairs in Pb2+ and Bi3+ in the TI helps for efficient CO2 binding, which are responsible for boosting overall catalytic activity. In variable ratio of acetonitrile&#8208;water (MeCN&#8201;:&#8201;H2O) solvent mixture COF@TI produces syngas with different ratios of CO and H2. COF@TI nano&#8208;heterostructure enables to produce higher amount of syngas with more controllable ratios of CO and H2 compared to pristine COF. The electron transfer route from COF to TI was realized from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, charge density difference calculation, excited state lifetime and photoelectrochemical measurements. Finally, a probable mechanistic pathway has been established after identifying the catalytic sites and reaction intermediates by in situ DRIFTS study and DFT calculation.

         <title>Fe, N&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Redistribution in NiCo Spinel on Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon for Bi&#8208;functional Oxygen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4 catalysts were designed through the interface electron redistribution strategy. Due to the doping of Fe and N, the Co, Ni sites promotes the coordination and dissociation of water and the oxygen reduction. The formation of Ni&#8722;VO&#8722;Fe structure accelerates the oxygen evolution reaction. Electron regulation among Multiple active sites provides positive effect on the reversible conversion of oxygen.







Abstract
Herein, an interfacial electron redistribution is proposed to boost the activity of carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4 catalyst toward oxygen conversion via Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy. Fe&#8208;doping into octahedron induces a redistribution of electrons between Co and Ni atoms on NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon. The increased electron density of Co promotes the coordination of water to Co sites and further dissociation. The generation of proton from water improves the overall activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The increased electron density of Ni facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies. The Ni&#8722;VO&#8722;Fe structure accelerates the deprotonation of *OOH to improve the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). N&#8208;doping modulates the electron density of carbon to form active sites for the adsorption and protonation of oxygen species. Fir wood&#8208;derived carbon endows catalyst with an integral structure to enable outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon express high half&#8208;wave potential up to 0.86&#8197;V in ORR and low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in OER. The zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) assembled with the as&#8208;prepared catalyst achieve long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 2000&#8197;cycles) with peak power density (180&#8197;mWcm&#8722;2). Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy drives the catalysis of biomass&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based catalysts to the highest level for the oxygen conversion in ZABs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Based Photoenzymatic Nano&#8208;reactor for Asymmetric Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we described a multi&#8208;functional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir, which was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework material COF&#8208;Ir. The bio&#8208;nanoreactor could serve as efficient catalyst in dynamic kinetic resolution of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor showed high stability and reusability.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;catalysis represents a highly efficient and stereoselective method for the synthesis of valuable chiral compounds, however, the poor stability and limited reaction types of free enzymes restrict their wide application in industrial production. In this work, to overcome these problems, a multifunctional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework COF&#8208;Ir. This bio&#8208;nanocluster serves as efficient catalysts in asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The well&#8208;designed COF&#8208;Ir not only acts as safety cover to prevent CALB from deactivation but promotes racemization of secondary amines via photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. Photoelectric characterization and TDDFT calculation revealed that (ppy)2Ir units in COF&#8208;Ir play crucial role in this photocatalytic system which enhance its photo&#8208;redox properties through facilitating the separation between photoelectrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+). Furthermore, the heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor could be recycled for five rounds with slight decline of catalytic reactivity.

This bio-nanocluster serves as efficient catalysts in asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The well-designed &lt;b&gt;COF-Ir&lt;/b&gt; not only acts as safety cover to prevent CALB from deactivation but promotes racemization of secondary amines via photo-induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. Photoelectric characterization and TDDFT calculation revealed that (ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ir units in &lt;b&gt;COF-Ir&lt;/b&gt; play crucial role in this photocatalytic system which enhance its photo-redox properties through facilitating the separation between photoelectrons (e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and holes (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor could be recycled for five rounds with slight decline of catalytic reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Probes for Imaging Detection of Enzyme Activities by NIR Luminescence, T1&#8208; and ParaCEST MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that using a single ligand complexed to different lanthanide ions, successful visualization of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity is possible in complementary optical and MR modalities : NIR luminescence (Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and T1 (Gd3+) MR imaging.







Abstract
Applying a single molecular probe to monitor enzymatic activities in multiple, complementary imaging modalities is highly desirable to ascertain detection and to avoid the complexity associated with the use of agents of different chemical entities. We demonstrate here the versatility of lanthanide (Ln3+) complexes with respect to their optical and magnetic properties and their potential for enzymatic detection in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1 MR imaging, controlled by the nature of the Ln3+ ion, while using a unique chelator. Based on X&#8208;ray structural, photophysical, and solution NMR investigations of a family of Ln3+ DO3A&#8208;pyridine model complexes, we could rationalize the luminescence (Eu3+, Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and relaxation (Gd3+) properties and their variations between carbamate and amine derivatives. This allowed the design of 
 probes which undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated changes detectable in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI, respectively governed by variations in their absorption energy, in their exchanging proton pool and in their size, thus relaxation efficacy. We demonstrate that these properties can be exploited for the visualization of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in phantom samples by different imaging modalities: NIR optical imaging, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI.

         <title>Confining Polymer Electrolyte in MOF for Safe and High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, exhibiting unusual properties: enhanced sodium ion conductivity and transference number, wider electrochemical voltage windows, and dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, even at high working temperature.







Abstract
Nanoconfined polymer molecules exhibit profound transformations in their properties and behaviors. Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the anions, facilitating the Na ion dissociation from salt. Simultaneously, the well&#8208;defined nanopores within ZIF&#8208;8 particles provide oriented and ordered migration channels for Na migration. As a result, this pioneering design allows the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.89 V vs. Na/Na+. The assembled SSMBs (with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode) exhibit dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96&#8201;% capacity retention over 300&#8197;cycles. This innovative polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF design offers a compelling strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance and safe solid&#8208;state metal battery technologies.

         <title>Supramolecular Modular Assembly of Imaging&#8208;Trackable Enzymatic Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular assembly platform based on Janus hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle was synthesized by surface chemistry and physical deposition technology. Through host&#8211;guest interaction, different engine and imaging modules modified by corresponding guest or host molecules can be quickly assembled to build various imaging&#8208;trackable enzymatic nanomotors on&#8208;demand, which can readily meet the needs of different application scenarios.







Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great application potential in biomedicine, sensing, environmental remediation, etc. In the past decade, various strategies or technologies have been used to prepare and functionalize MNMs. However, the current preparation strategies of the MNMs were mainly following the pre&#8208;designed methods based on specific tasks to introduce expected functional parts on the various micro/nanocarriers, which lacks a universal platform and common features, making it difficult to apply to different application scenarios. Here, we have developed a modular assembly strategy based on host&#8211;guest chemistry, which enables the on&#8208;demand construction of imaging&#8208;trackable nanomotors mounted with suitable driving and imaging modules using a universal assembly platform, according to different application scenarios. These assembled nanomotors exhibited enhanced diffusion behavior driven by enzymatic reactions. The loaded imaging functions were used to dynamically trace the swarm motion behavior of assembled nanomotors with corresponding fuel conditions both in vitro and in vivo. The modular assembly strategy endowed with host&#8211;guest interaction provides a universal approach to producing multifunctional MNMs in a facile and controllable manner, which paves the way for the future development of MNMs systems with programmable functions.

         <title>Topology Controlled All&#8208;(Meth)acrylic Thermoplastic Elastomers by Multi&#8208;Functional Lewis Pairs&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;initiating Lewis pairs are developed to realize living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, achieving not only ultrahigh molecular weight polyacrylates (Mn up to 2174&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1), but also control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star) in one&#8208;step manner. The produced star triblock TPEs exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and excellent AIE effects.







Abstract
It remains challenging to synthesize all&#8208;(meth)acrylic triblock thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), due to the drastically different reactivities between the acrylates and methacrylates and inevitable occurrence of side reactions during polymerization of acrylates. By taking advantage of the easy structural modulation features of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), we design and synthesize strong nucleophilic tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based NHOs varying in the number (i.e. mono&#8208;, dual&#8208; and tetra&#8722;) of initiating functional groups. Its combination with bulky organoaluminum [iBuAl(BHT)2] (BHT=bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tBu&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy)) constructs Lewis pair (LP) to realize the living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, furnishing polyacrylates with ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn up to 2174&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1) within 4&#8197;min. Moreover, these NHO&#8208;based LPs enable us to not only realize the control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star), but also achieve triblock star copolymers in one&#8208;step manner. Mechanical studies reveal that the star triblock TPEs exhibit better mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 1863&#8201;% and tensile strength up to 19.1&#8197;MPa) in comparison with the linear analogs. Moreover, the presence of tetraphenylethylene group in the NHOs entitled the triblock TPEs with excellent AIE properties in both solution and solid state.

         <title>The Ferroxidase Centre of Escherichia coli Bacterioferritin Plays a Key Role in the Reductive Mobilisation of the Mineral Iron Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diiron ferroxidase centres of ferritins are required for Fe2+ oxidation and formation of the mineral core. Here, we show that the ferroxidase centres of bacterioferritin (Bfr) also play a key role in iron release, and that this is dependent on electron transfer from the Bfr heme to the ferroxidase centre.







Abstract
Ferritins are multimeric cage&#8208;forming proteins that play a crucial role in cellular iron homeostasis. All H&#8208;chain&#8208;type ferritins harbour a diiron site, the ferroxidase centre, at the centre of a 4 &#945;&#8208;helical bundle, but bacterioferritins are unique in also binding 12&#8197;hemes per 24&#8197;meric assembly. The ferroxidase centre is known to be required for the rapid oxidation of Fe2+ during deposition of an immobilised ferric mineral core within the protein's hollow interior. In contrast, the heme of bacterioferritin is required for the efficient reduction of the mineral core during iron release, but has little effect on the rate of either oxidation or mineralisation of iron. Thus, the current view is that these two cofactors function in iron uptake and release, respectively, with no functional overlap. However, rapid electron transfer between the heme and ferroxidase centre of bacterioferritin from Escherichia coli was recently demonstrated, suggesting that the two cofactors may be functionally connected. Here we report absorbance and (magnetic) circular dichroism spectroscopies, together with in vitro assays of iron&#8208;release kinetics, which demonstrate that the ferroxidase centre plays an important role in the reductive mobilisation of the bacterioferritin mineral core, which is dependent on the heme&#8208;ferroxidase centre electron transfer pathway.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Ag25 Nanoclusters Encapsulated in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of MAg24 (M=Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au) NCs into a metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affords MAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composites. The AuAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibits the best activity, surpassing all other counterparts, and demonstrates excellent recyclability in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The formation of Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction promotes charge separation, in conjunction with optimized Ag electronic state, which are responsible for the enhanced photocatalysis.







Abstract
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) with unique optical properties and abundant catalytic sites are promising in photocatalysis. However, their light&#8208;induced instability and the difficulty of utilizing the photogenerated carriers for photocatalysis pose significant challenges. Here, MAg24 (M=Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au) NCs doped with diverse single heteroatoms have been encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affording MAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Strikingly, compared with Ag25@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the MAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 doped with heteroatom exhibits much enhanced activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production, among which AuAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 presents the best activity up to 3.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, far superior to all other counterparts. Moreover, they display excellent photocatalytic recyclability and stability. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that MAg24 NCs encapsulated into the MOF create a favorable charge transfer pathway, similar to a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, when exposed to visible light. This promotes charge separation, along with optimized Ag electronic state, which are responsible for the superior activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Polarized Ultrathin BN Induced Dynamic Electron Interactions for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice&#8208;matched interface between defect&#8208;rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) and RuO2 is ingeniously constructed to achieve robust acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability, due to the directional electron transfer of interface from B and N vacancies to RuO2.







Abstract
Developing ruthenium&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with an efficient and stable interface is essential for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheet support with relatively independent electron donor and acceptor sites, which serves as an electron reservoir and receiving station for RuO2, realizing the rapid supply and reception of electrons. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a low OER overpotential of only 180&#8197;mV (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term operational stability (350&#8197;h) are achieved, suggesting potential practical applications. In&#8197;situ characterization and theoretical calculations have validated the existence of a localized electronic recycling between RuO2 and ultrathin BN nanosheets (BNNS). The electron&#8208;rich Ru sites accelerate the adsorption of water molecules and the dissociation of intermediates, while the interconnection between the O&#8208;terminal and B&#8208;terminal edge establishes electronic back&#8208;donation, effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of lattice oxygen. This study provides a new perspective for constructing a stable and highly active catalytic interface.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isolable azo&#8208;linked pre&#8208;rotaxane serves as the core building block for modular rotaxane synthesis. By iterative module connections followed by traceless removal of the azo linkers, [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes composed of all&#8208;benzene scaffolds have been synthesized and characterized.







Abstract
&#8220;Improbable&#8221; rotaxanes consisting of interlocked conjugated components represent non&#8208;trivial synthetic targets, not to mention those with all&#8208;benzene scaffolds. Herein, a modular synthetic strategy has been established using an isolable azo&#8208;linked pre&#8208;rotaxane as the core module, in which the azo group functions as a tracelessly removable template to direct mechanical bond formations. Through versatile connections of the pre&#8208;rotaxane and other customizable modules, [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes derived from all&#8208;benzene scaffolds have been accomplished, demonstrating the utility and potential of the synthetic design for all&#8208;benzene interlocked supramolecules.

         <title>Orienting Group Directed Cascade Borylation for Efficient One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as Narrowband Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were synthesized from triarylamines by orienting group directed regioselective one&#8208;shot cascade borylation. The facile and scalable method enabled sustainable production of diverse organic emitting materials exhibiting narrowband emission. OLEDs based on the emitters showed high color purity in blue and green region with high external quantum efficiencies up to 40.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have emerged as very promising emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrowband emission spectra that may find application in high&#8208;definition displays. While considerable research has focused on investigating the properties of these materials, less attention has been placed on their synthetic methodology. Here we developed an efficient synthetic method for 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs, which enables sustainable production of narrowband organic emitting materials. By strategically introducing substituents, such as methyl, tert&#8208;butyl, phenyl, and chloride, at the C5 position of the 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine substrates, we achieved remarkable regioselective borylation in the para&#8208;position of the substituted moiety. This approach facilitated the synthesis of a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs emitters with good yields and exceptional regioselectivity. The synthetic method demonstrated excellent scalability for large&#8208;scale production and enabled late&#8208;stage transformation of the borylated products. Mechanistic investigations provided valuable insights into the pivotal roles of electron effect and steric hindrance effect in achieving highly efficient regioselective borylation. Moreover, the outstanding device performance of the synthesized compounds 10&#8201;b and 6&#8201;z, underscores the practicality and significance of the developed method.

Here we developed an efficient synthetic method for 1,4-BN-doped PAHs, which enables sustainable production of narrowband organic emitting materials. By strategically introducing substituents, such as methyl, &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl, phenyl, and chloride, at the C5 position of the 1,3-benzenediamine substrates, we achieved remarkable regioselective borylation in the para-position of the substituted moiety. This approach facilitated the synthesis of a diverse range of 1,4-BN-doped PAHs emitters with good yields and exceptional regioselectivity. The synthetic method demonstrated excellent scalability for large-scale production and enabled late-stage transformation of the borylated products. Mechanistic investigations provided valuable insights into the pivotal roles of electron effect and steric hindrance effect in achieving highly efficient regioselective borylation. Moreover, the outstanding device performance of the synthesized compounds &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;z&lt;/b&gt;, underscores the practicality and significance of the developed method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Heterometal&#8208;Organic Capsules for Selectively Encapsulating Tetrahedral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of PdII ions with metalloligand CuL1 gives a heterometallic Pd3Cu6L16 capsule, which can undergo precise post&#8208;synthetic modification with two tridentate anionic ligands to form a bicapped Pd3Cu6L16L22 capsule. Reversible post&#8208;synthetic modification between Pd3Cu6L16L22, Pd3Cu6L16L2, and Pd3Cu6L16 can be achieved by varying the reaction conditions. These capsules are able to selectively encapsulate tetrahedral anions.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification plays a crucial role in precisely adjusting the structure and functions of advanced materials. Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of a tubular heterometallic Pd3Cu6L16 capsule that incorporates Pd(II) and CuL1 metalloligands. This capsule undergoes further modification with two tridentate anionic ligands (L2) to afford a bicapped Pd3Cu6L16L22 capsule with an Edshammer polyhedral structure. By employing transition metal ions, acid, and oxidation agents, the bicapped capsule can be converted into an uncapped one. This uncapped form can then revert back to the bicapped structure on the addition of Br&#8722; ions and a base. Interestingly, introducing Ag+ ions leads to the removal of one L2 ligand from the bicapped capsule, yielding a mono&#8208;capped Pd3Cu6L16L2 structure. Furthermore, the size of the anions critically influences the precise control over the post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the capsules. It was demonstrated that these capsules selectively encapsulate tetrahedral anions, offering a novel approach for the design of intelligent molecular delivery systems.

         <title>Effect of Intrinsic Ferroelectric Phase Transition on Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the effect of intrinsic ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric (PE) phase transition on electrocatalytic HER activity is studied using 2D CuInP2S6 nanosheet. Combining the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the regulated electrocatalytic activity is demonstrate, in which a clear discontinuity on overpotential and apparent activation energy values is directly observed by the corresponding FE&#8208;to&#8208;PE phase transition over 2D CuInP2S6 around the Tc point (318&#8197;K).







Abstract
Heterogeneous electrocatalysis closely relies on the electronic structure of the catalytic materials. The ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition of the materials also involves a change in the state of electrons that could impact the electrocatalytic activity, but such correlation remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity could be regulated as exampled by hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis over two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric CuInP2S6. The obvious discontinuity in the overpotential and apparent activation energy values for CuInP2S6 electrode are illustrated during the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition caused by copper displacement around Tc point (318&#8197;K), revealing the ferroelectro&#8208;catalytic effect on thermodynamics and kinetics of electrocatalysis. When loading Pt single atom on the CuInP2S6, the paraelectric phase one showed an improved hydrogen evolution activity with smaller apparent activation energy over the ferroelectric phase counterpart. This is attributed to the copper hopping between two sulfur planes, which alternate between strong and weak H adsorption at the Pt sites to simultaneously promote H+ reactant adsorption and H2 product desorption.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Site&#8208;Selective Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Stilbene Pairs in a DNA Duplex Mediated by Ruthenium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective photocrosslinking of DNA duplex was achieved in the Research Article (e202319516) by Hiromu Kashida, Hiroyuki Asanuma et&#8197;al. A ruthenium complex on a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide effectively catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties in a DNA duplex under visible light. Since the reaction proceeds via triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer, the reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity.

         <title>The Cyanoketenyl Anion [NC3O]&#8208;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cumulenes and heterocumulenes with three or more cumulative multiple bonds are usually reactive species that serve as valuable building blocks for more complex molecules but tend to isomerize or cyclize and therefore are difficult to isolate. Using a mild ligand exchange reaction at the carbon in metalated ylides, we have now succeeded in the synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8208;. Despite its assumed cumulene&#8208;like structure and the delocalization of the negative charge across the whole 5&#8208;atom molecule, it features a bent geometry with a nucleophilic central carbon atom. Computational studies reveal an ambiguous bonding situation in the anion, which can be illustrated only by a combination of different resonance structures. Nonetheless, the anion features remarkable stability, thus allowing the storage of its potassium&#8208;crown ether salt and its application as a highly functional synthetic building block. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate. This work demonstrated that reactive species can be generated by novel synthesis methods and open up atom&#8208;economic pathways to complex compounds from small abundant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation&#8208;tailored PVDF&#8208;based Solid&#8208;state Electrolyte for High&#8208;voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electro&#8208;lytes are attracting increasing attention for high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries because of their high room temperature ionic conductivity, adequate mechanical strength and good thermal stability. However, the presence of highly reactive residual solvents, such as N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), severely jeopardizes the long&#8208;term cycling stability. Herein, we propose a solvation&#8208;tailoring strategy to confine residual solvent molecules by introducing low&#8208;cost 3 &#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers. The strong interaction between DMF and the molecular sieve weakens the ability of DMF to participate in the solvation of Li+, leading to more anions being involved in solvation. Benefiting from the tailored anion&#8208;rich coordination environment, the interfacial side reactions with the lithium anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode are effectively suppressed. As a result, the solid&#8208;state Li||Li symmetrical cells demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 5100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2, and the Li||NCM811 full cells achieve excellent cycling stability for more than 1130 and 250 cycles under the charging cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3 V and 4.5 V, respectively. Our work is an innovative exploration to address the negative effects of residual DMF in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes and highlights the importance of modulating the solvation structures in solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated Chain Reptation Enhances Energy Dissipation of Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrations with various frequencies in daily life and industry can cause health hazards and fatigue failure of critical structures, which requires the development of elastomers with high energy dissipation at desired frequencies. Current strategies relying on tuning characteristic relaxation time of polymer chains are mostly qualitative empirical methods, and it is difficult to precisely control damping performances. Here, we report a general strategy for constructing dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels that provide controllable ultrahigh energy dissipation. This is realized by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation of polymer fluids in a&#160;crosslinked network, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass. Using prototypical supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, we demonstrate that dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh damping performance at desired frequencies (10^&#8208;2 ~ 10^2 Hz), exceeding that of typical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicone damping materials. Their shock absorption is over 300% higher than that of commercial silicone rubber under the same impact force.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation of a Chiral Hybrid Lead Halide Resonant to Charge Transfer Exciton from Metal Halide Octahedra to Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) offer an ideal platform for the advancement of second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their inherent noncentrosymmetric structures. The enhancement of optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs could be achieved by matching the free exciton and/or self&#8208;trapped exciton energy levels with desired NLO frequencies. However, the current scarcity of resonance modes and low resonance ratio hamper the further improvements of NLO performance. Herein, we propose a new resonant channel of charge transfer (CT) excited states from metal halide polyhedra to organic ligand to boost the second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs. The model lead halide (C7H10N)PbBr3 (C7H10N = 1&#8208;ethylpyridinium) exhibits a drastically enhanced second harmonic generation in resonance to the deep CT exciton energy, with intensity of up to 111.0 times that of KDP and 10.9 times that of urea. The effective NLO coefficient has been determined to be as high as ~40.2 pm V&#8208;1, balanced with a large polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold. This work highlights the contribution of organic ligands in the construction of a resonant channel for enhancing second&#8208;order NLO coefficients of metal halides, and thus provides guidelines for designing new chiral HOMHs materials for advanced nonlinear photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric&#8208;hindrance Effect Tuned Ion Solvation Enabling High Performance Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite many additives have been reported for aqueous zinc ion batteries, steric&#8208; hindrance effect of additives and its correlation with Zn2+ solvation structure have been rarely reported. Herein, large&#8208;sized sucrose biomolecule is selected as a paradigm additive, and steric&#8208;hindrance electrolytes (STEs) are developed to investigate the steric&#8208;hindrance effect for solvation structure regulation. Sucrose molecules do not participate in Zn2+ solvation shell, but significantly homogenize the distribution of solvated Zn2+ and enlarge Zn2+ solvation shell with weakened Zn2+&#8208;H2O interaction due to the steric&#8208;hindrance effect. More importantly, STEs afford the water&#8208;shielding electric double layer and in&#8208;situ construct the organic and inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface, which effectively boost Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, Zn//NVO battery presents high capacity of 3.9 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2 with long cycling stability for over 650 cycles at lean electrolyte of 4.5 &#956;L&#183;mg&#8208;1 and low N/P ratio of 1.5, and the stable operation at wide temperature (&#8208;20 oC ~ +40 oC).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Electrolyte and Interphasial Chemistry for All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) present a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, realizing all&#8208;climate SIBs operating across a wide temperature range remains a challenge due to the poor electrolyte conductivity and instable electrode interphases at extreme temperatures. Here, we propose a comprehensively balanced electrolyte by pairing carbonates with a low&#8208;freezing&#8208;point and low&#8208;polarity ethyl propionate solvent which enhances ion diffusion and Na+&#8208;desolvation kinetics at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Furthermore, the electrolyte leverages a combinatorial borate&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;based additive strategy to facilitate uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich electrode interphases, ensuring excellent rate performance and cycle stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;45 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. Notably, the Na||sodium vanadyl phosphate cell delivers a remarkable capacity of 105 mA h g&#8722;1 with a high rate of 2 C at &#8722;25 &#176;C. In addition, the cells exhibit excellent cycling stability over a wide temperature range, maintaining a high capacity retention of 84.7% over 3,000 cycles at 60 &#176;C and of 95.1% at &#8722;25 &#176;C over 500 cycles. This study highlights the critical role of electrolyte and interphase engineering for enabling SIBs that function optimally under diverse and extreme climatic environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Dynamic Reconstruction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Ligand Defects for Selective Electrooxidation of Amines to Azos Coupling with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis coupled hydrogen production (ESHP) mostly involves catalyst reconstruction in aqueous phase, but accurately identifying and controlling the process is still a challenge. Herein, we modulated the electronic structure and exposed unsaturated sites of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via ligand defect to promote the reconstruction of catalyst for azo electrosynthesis (ESA) coupled with hydrogen production overall reaction. The monolayer Ni&#8208;MOFs achieved 89.8% Faraday efficiency and 90.8% selectivity for the electrooxidation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine (Pyr&#8208;NH2) to azo, and an 18.5&#8208;fold increase in H2 production compared to overall water splitting. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) and various in situ spectroscopy confirm that the ligand defect promotes the potential dependent dynamic reconstruction of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH, and the reabsorption of ligand significantly lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (*Pyr&#8208;NH to *Pyr&#8208;N). This work provides theoretical guidance for modulation of electrocatalyst reconstruction to achieve highly selective ESHP.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Canoe&#8208;like Pd0 or Pt0 Alloyed Copper Alkynyl Nanoclusters Display Near&#8208;infrared&#160; Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) has emerged as a widely explored and versatile strategy for tailoring tunable properties, facilitating in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level investigations of structure&#8208;property correlations. In this study, six atomically precise copper NCs alloyed with Group 10 metals (Pd or Pt) were successfully synthesized. Notably, the Pd0 or Pt0 atom is situated at the center of the distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage, coordinated with twelve Cu+ and two tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; ligands. Moreover, ligand exchange strategies demonstrated the potential for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; to replace one or two alkynyl ligands positioned at the top or side of the clusters. The chirality exhibited by these racemic NCs is primarily attributed to the involvement of halogen atoms and a chiral PdCu18 skeleton. Furthermore, all the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence, characterized by emission peaks at 700&#8722;760 nm, lifetimes ranging from 6.630 to 9.662 &#956;s, and absolute quantum yields of 1.75%&#8722;2.52% in their crystalline state. The experimental optical properties of these NCs are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of theoretical calculations. These alloy NCs not only offer valuable insights into the synthesis of alloying Pd0/Pt0&#8722;Cu NCs, but also bridge the gap in understanding the structure&#8208;photoluminescence relationships of Pd0/Pt0&#8722;Cu molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C(sp3)&#8210;H Silylation: Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Efficiency&#8208;Determined Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nuanced role of spin effects remains a critical gap in designing proficient open&#8208;shell catalysts.  This study elucidates an iron&#8208;catalyzed allylic C(sp3)&#8210;H silylation/alkyne hydrosilylation reaction, in which the spin state of the open&#8208;shell iron catalyst dictates the reaction kinetics and  pathway. Specifically, spin crossover led to alkyne hydrosilylation, whereas spin conservation resulted in a novel allylic C(sp3)&#8210;H silylation reaction. This chemoselectivity, governed by the spin&#8208;crossover efficiency, reveals an unexpected dimension in spin effects and a first in the realm of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed in situ silylation of allylic C(sp3)&#8210;H bonds, which had been previously inhibited by the heightened reactivity of alkenes in hydrosilylation reactions. Furthermore, this spin crossover can either accelerate or hinder the reaction at different stages within a single catalytic reaction, a phenomenon scarcely documented. Moreover, we identify a substrate&#8208;assisted C&#8210;H activation mechanism, a departure from known ligand&#8208;assisted processes, offering a fresh perspective on C&#8210;H activation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge transfer dynamics in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid heterostructures &#8208; insights by vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures play a pivotal role in modern electronic and optoelectronic applications including photodetectors, field effect transistors, as well as in solar&#8208;energy conversion such as photoelectrodes of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and in organic photovoltaics. To a large extent, the performance of such devices is controlled by charge transfer dynamics at and across (inner) interfaces, e.g., between a wide band gap semiconductor and molecular sensitizers and/or catalysts. Hence, a detailed understanding of the structure&#8208;dynamics&#8208;function relationship of such functional interfaces is necessary to rationalize possible performance limitations of these materials and devices on a molecular level. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, as an interface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic technique, allows to obtain chemically specific information from interfaces and combine such chemical insights with ultrafast time resolution, when integrated as a spectroscopic probe into a pump&#8208;probe scheme. Thus, this perspective discusses the advantages and potential of VSFG spectroscopy for investigating interfacial charge transfer dynamics and structural changes at inner interfaces. A critical perspective of the unique spectroscopic view of otherwise inaccessible interfaces is presented, which we hope opens new opportunities for an improved understanding of function&#8208;determining processes in complex materials, and brings together communities who are devoted to designing materials and devices with spectroscopists.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloradical Catalysis: General Approach for Controlling Reactivity and Selectivity of Homolytic Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since Friedrich Wohler&#8217;s groundbreaking synthesis of urea in 1828, organic synthesis over the past two centuries has predominantly relied on the exploration and utilization of chemical reactions rooted in two&#8208;electron heterolytic ionic chemistry. While one&#8208;electron homolytic radical chemistry is both rich in fundamental reactivities and attractive with practical advantages, the synthetic application of radical reactions has been long hampered by the formidable challenges associated with the control over reactivity and selectivity of high&#8208;energy radical intermediates. To fully harness the untapped potential of radical chemistry for organic synthesis, there is a pressing need to formulate radically different concepts and broadly applicable strategies to address these outstanding issues. In pursuit of this objective, researchers have been actively developing metalloradical catalysis (MRC) as a comprehensive framework to guide the design of general approaches for controlling over reactivity and stereoselectivity of homolytic radical reactions. Essentially, MRC exploits the metal&#8208;centered radicals present in open&#8208;shell metal complexes as on&#8208;electron catalysts for homolytic activation of substrates to generate metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as the key intermediates to govern the reaction pathway and stereochemical course of subsequent catalytic radical processes. Different from the conventional two&#8208;electron catalysis by transition metal complexes, MRC operates through one&#8208;electron chemistry utilizing stepwise radical mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Polarity in Kagome&#8208;NiAs Bismuthides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 2&#215;2&#215;1 superstructure of the P63/mmc NiAs structure is reported in which kagome nets are stabilized in the octahedral transition metal layers of the compounds Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. The ordered vacancies that yield the true hexagonal kagome motif lead to filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites with the transition metal in this family of &#8220;kagome&#8208;NiAs&#8221; type materials. Further ordering of vacancies within these interstitial layers can be compositionally driven to simultaneously yield kagome&#8208;connected layers and a net polarization along the c axes in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi, which adopt Fmm2 symmetry. The polar and non&#8208;polar materials exhibit different electronic transport behaviour, reflecting the tuneability of both structure and properties within the NiAs&#8208;type bismuthide materials family.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell, Single&#8208;Mitochondrial DNA Assay Using Hydrogel Droplet Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing interest in understanding the biological implications of single cell heterogeneity and heteroplasmy of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but current methodologies for single&#8208;cell mtDNA analysis limit the scale of analysis to small cell populations. Although droplet microfluidics have increased the throughput of single&#8208;cell genomic, RNA, and protein analysis, their application to sub&#8208;cellular organelle analysis has remained a largely unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce an agarose&#8208;based droplet microfluidic approach for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis, which allows simultaneous processing of hundreds of individual mtDNA molecules within &gt;10,000 individual cells. Our microfluidic chip encapsulates individual cells in agarose beads, designed to have a sufficiently dense hydrogel network to retain mtDNA after lysis and provide a robust scaffold for subsequent multi&#8208;step processing and analysis. To mitigate the impact of the high viscosity of agarose required for mtDNA retention on the throughput of microfluidics, we developed a parallelized device, successfully achieving ~95% mtDNA retention from single cells within our microbeads at &gt;700,000 drops/minute. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed specific regions of the single&#8208;mtDNA using a multiplexed rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay. We demonstrated compatibility with both microscopy, for digital counting of individual RCA products, and flow cytometry for higher throughput analysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The salt metathesis reaction of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediide with aluminum(III) dichlorides provides either half&#8208;sandwich alumole complexes of germanium(II) or aluminylene germole complexes. Their molecular structure and the delocalized bonding situation, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are equally described as isomeric aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes with either the germanium or the aluminum atom in the apical position of the pentagonal pyramid. The product formation and the selectivity of the reaction depends on the third substituent of the aluminum dichloride. Aryl&#8208;substituents favor the formation of alumole complexes and Cp*&#8208;substituents that of the isomeric germole complexes. With amino&#8208;substituents at the aluminum atom mixtures of both isomers are formed and the positional exchange of the two heteroatoms is shown by NMR spectroscopy. The alumole complexes of Ge(II) undergo facile reductive elimination of germanium and form the corresponding alumoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Tricoordinate Organoberyllium Azides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of terminal mono&#8208; and disubstituted beryllium azides of the form [(CAAC)Be(N3)R] (R = CAACH, Dur; CAACH / CAAC = 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl/idene, Dur = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) and [L2Be(N3)2] (L = CAACNH = 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine, IiPrMe = 1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), respectively, were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Thermolysis and photolysis products of these first examples of tricoordinate azidoberyllium complexes evidence extensive ligand scrambling and the formal insertion of nitrenes&#160;into the CAAC&#8210;Be bond, generating cyclic alkyl(amino)imine (CAAI) ligands. Furthermore, the reaction with a small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) leads to unexpected CAAC&#8208;NHC ligand exchange, while the reaction with pentaphenylborole yields the first &#947;&#8208;azide adduct of a borole, long postulated to be the first step in the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines from boroles and azides.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;linkable fullerene enables elastic and conductive grain boundaries for efficient and wearable tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have received increasing attention due to their low toxicity, high theoretical efficiency, and potential applications as wearable devices. However, the inherent fast and uncontrollable crystallization process of tin&#8208;based perovskites results in high defect density in the film. Meanwhile, when fabricated into flexible devices, the prepared perovskite film exhibits inevitable brittleness and high Young's modulus, seriously weakening the mechanical stability. In this work, we design and synthesize a cross&#8208;linkable fullerene, thioctic acid functionalized C60 fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (FTAI), which has multiple interactions with perovskite components and can finely regulate the crystallization quality of perovskite film. The obtained perovskite film shows an increased grain size and a more matched energy level with the electron transport material, effectively improving the carrier extraction efficiency. The FTAI&#8208;based rigid device achieves a champion efficiency of 14.91% with enhanced stability. More importantly, the FTAI located at the perovskite grain boundaries could spontaneously cross&#8208;link during the perovskite annealing process, which effectively improves the conductivity and elasticity of grain boundaries, thereby giving the film excellent bending resistance. Finally, the FTAI&#8208;based wearable device yields a record efficiency of 12.35% and displays robust bending durability, retaining about 90% of the initial efficiency after 10,000 bending times.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Interphases Regulated by Trace Dual Electrolyte Additives for Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic zinc is a promising anode material for rechargeable aqueous multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, the practical use is always beset by severe dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions occurring at anode/electrolyte interface. Here we demonstrate that dynamic molecular interphases caused by trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate for ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. Triggered by plating and stripping electric fields, the D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species are alternately and reversibly (de&#8208;)adsorbed on Zn metal, respectively, to accelerate Zn2+ transportation for uniform Zn nucleation and deposition and inhibit side reactions for high coulombic efficiency. As a result, Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating behaviors for &gt;6400 hours at 1 mA cm&#8722;2, which enables long&#8208;term cycling stability of Zn||ZnxMnO2 full cell for more than 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemical&#160;Cascade Process Boosting Smart Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Bismuth Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), exhibiting multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, has garnered considerable attention due to its potential applications in light&#8208;emitting devices, sensors, and information safety. This work proposes the utilization of photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) in molecular crystals to design a stepwise smart RTP switch. By harnessing the sequential dynamics of photo&#8208;burst movement (induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition) and photochromism (induced by photogenerated radicals) in a Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic halide&#160;(MOH), a continuous and photo&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP can be achieved. Furthermore, utilizing the same Bi&#8208;based MOH, diverse application demonstrations, such as multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption, can be easily implemented. This work thus not only serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of solid&#8208;state PCCPs that integrate photosalient effect and photochromism with light&#8208;chemical&#8208;mechanical energy conversion, but also lays the groundwork for designing new Bi&#8208;based MOHs with dynamically responsive ultralong RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Probe for High Spatial Quantitative Imaging of Tumor Nitric Oxide in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor effects. Therefore, real&#8208;time in vivo imaging and quantification of tumor NO dynamics are essential for understanding the conflicting roles of NO played in pathophysiology. The current molecular probes, however, cannot provide high&#8208;resolution imaging in deep tissues, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Herein, we designed a photoacoustic probe with an absorption maximum beyond 1000 nm for high spatial quantitative imaging of in vivo tumor NO dynamics. The probe exhibits remarkable sensitivity, selective ratiometric response behavior, and good tumor&#8208;targeting abilities, facilitating ratiometric imaging of tumor NO throughout tumor progression in a micron&#8208;resolution level. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully quantified NO dynamics in tumor, liver and kidney. We have pinpointed an essential concentration threshold of around 80 nmol/cm3 for NO, which plays a crucial role in the "double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword" function of NO in tumors. Furthermore, we revealed a reciprocal relationship between the NO concentration in tumors and that in the liver, providing initial insights into the possible NO&#8208;mediated communication between tumor and the liver. We believe that the probe will help resolve conflicting aspects of NO biology and guide the design of imaging agents for tumor diagnosis and anti&#8208;cancer drug screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: on the Detection and Stability of the Initial Carbonyloxy Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), light&#8208;induced formation of the primary radical product RCOO&#9679; from fatty acid RCOO&#8211; occurs in 300&#160;ps, upon which CO2 is released quasi&#8208;immediately. Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO&#9679; (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6&#8209;dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB&#9679;), much longer&#8208;lived linear RCOO&#9679; has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB&#9679; decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB&#9679;, aliphatic RCOO&#9679; radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, &lt;&lt;300&#160;ps RCOO&#9679; decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) are still challenging due to the harmful reactions including hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a natural small molecule acid vitamin C (Vc) as an aqueous electrolyte additive has been selectively identified. The small molecule Vc can adjust the d band center of Zn substrate which fixes the active H+ so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is restrained. Simultaneously, it could also fine&#8211;tune the solvation structure of Zn ions due to the enhanced electrostatics and reduced Pauli repulsion verified by energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Hence, the cell retains an ultra&#8211;long cycle performance of over 1300 cycles and a superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5%. The prepared full cells display increased rate capability, cycle lifetime, and self&#8211;discharge suppression. Our results shed light on the mechanistic principle of electrolyte additives on the performance improvement of ZIBs, which is anticipated to render a new round of studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Azo&#8208;free Mitsunobu&#8208;type Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The classic chemical Mitsunobu reaction suffers from the need of excess alcohol activation reagents and the generation of significant by&#8208;products. Efforts to overcome these limitations have resulted in numerous creative solutions, but the substrate scope of these catalytic processes remains limited. Here we report an electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, which features azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope. This user&#8208;friendly technology allows a vast collection of heterocycles as the nucleophile, which can couple with a series of chiral cyclic and acyclic alcohols in moderate to high yields and excellent ee&#8217;s. This practical reaction is scalable, chemoselective, uses simple Electrasyn setup with inexpensive electrodes and requires no precaution to exclude air and moisture. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated on the structural modification of diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical derivatives and its straightforward application in a multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivated Circularly Polarized Luminescent Organic Radicals in Doped Amorphous Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organic radicals, especially those with photoactivated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features, hold great significance for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications, but their development still remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to achieve photoactivated CPL radicals by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system, yielding a compound of R/S&#8208;5,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bibenzo[d][1,3]dioxole (R/S&#8208;BDP). The photoactivated R/S&#8208;BDP molecules in polymer matrix display a robust quantum yield of 19.8% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.2&#215;10&#8208;4, marking this work as the first example of photoactivated CPL radicals. Furthermore, the glum is improved to 1.0&#215;10&#8208;2 by using a liquid crystal as host. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that R/S&#8208;BDP molecules, endowed with double phosphine cores in axial chirality, offer a direct way for intramolecular electron transfer upon photoirradiation. This leads to the generation of radical ionic pairs, which subsequently trigger the donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement through intermolecular electron transfer, thereby resulting in stable radical emission. The extended photoactivated BDP&#8208;F exhibits a remarkably high quantum efficiency of 57.8%. Ultimately, the distinctive photo&#8208;responsive CPL radical luminescence has been successfully used for information displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Four&#8208;electron Conversion in Tellurium Cathodes for Advanced Magnesium&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium (Mg) batteries hold promise as a large&#8208;scale energy storage solution, but their progress has been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Here, we address this challenge by unlocking the reversible four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of superior Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. Specifically, the classic magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte is tailored by introducing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2), which initiates the Te0/Te4+ conversion with two distinct charge&#8208;storage steps. Te cathode undergoes Te/TeCl4 conversion involving Cl&#8211; as charge carriers, during which a tellurium subchloride phase is presented as an intermediate. Significantly, the Te cathode achieves a high specific capacity of 543 mAh gTe&#8211;1 and an outstanding energy density of 850 Wh kgTe&#8211;1, outperforming most of the previously reported cathodes. Our electrolyte analysis indicates that the addition of Mg(TFSI)2 reduces the overall ion&#8208;molecule interaction and mitigates the strength of ion&#8208;solvent aggregation within the MACC electrolyte, which implies the facilized Cl&#8211; dissociation from the electrolyte. Besides, Mg(TFSI)2 is verified as an essential buffer to mitigate the corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes caused by the consumption of the electrolyte MgCl2 in Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion cells. These findings provide crucial insights into the development of advanced Mg&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Stereoselective Glycomodification of Biomolecules through Carbohydrate&#8208;Promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycomodification strategy targeting N&#8208;terminal tryptophan of biomolecules was developed using C6&#8208;oxidized glycans through a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, providing homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages. This method features high efficiency, mild conditions, robustness, biocompatibility, and applicability to a wide range of substrates, including glycans, peptides, proteins, and living&#8208;cell surfaces.







Abstract
Carbohydrates play pivotal roles in an array of essential biological processes and are consequently involved in many diseases. To meet the needs of glycobiology research, chemical enzymatic and non&#8208;enzymatic methods have been developed to generate glycoconjugates with well&#8208;defined structures. Herein, harnessing the unique properties of C6&#8208;oxidized glycans, we report a straightforward and robust strategy for site&#8208; and stereoselective glycomodification of biomolecules with N&#8208;terminal tryptophan residues by a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, which is not adapted to typical aldehyde substrates under biocompatible conditions. This method reliably delivers highly homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages and thus has great potential for functional modulation of peptides and proteins in glycobiology research. Moreover, this reaction can be performed at the glycosites of glycopeptides, glycoproteins and living&#8208;cell surfaces in a site&#8208;specific manner. Control experiments indicated that the protected &#945;&#8208;O atom of aldehyde donors and free N&#8722;H bond of the tryptamine motif are crucial for this reaction. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that the reaction exhibited a first&#8208;order dependence on both tryptophan and glycan, and deprotonation/rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Low&#8208;coordination Nanocrystalline Copper&#8208;based Catalysts through Theory&#8208;guided Electrochemical Restructuring for Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electrochemical restructuring calculation of Cu catalysts, a customized, low&#8208;coordination Cu catalyst was prepared for the efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethylene. Benefiting from this excellent catalyst, the selectivity of CO2 conversion to ethylene reached 72% at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a durable stability of 230 hours in an electrolyzer.







Abstract
Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low&#8208;coordination copper&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70&#8201;% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230&#8197;hours at a cell voltage of 3.5&#8197;V in a full&#8208;cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.

Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) catalysts but also advances CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis technologies for industrial application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8901;&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) has been developed.

A plausible mechanism has been proposed by control experiments, intermediate trapping experiments, etc. The unique unsymmetric structure of DBTDT endows it with herringbone packing structure and weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules as well as high transfer integrals, which enables a high carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Unsymmetric organic semiconductors have many advantages such as good solubility, rich intermolecular interactions for potential various optoelectronic applications. However, their synthesis is more challenging due to intricate structures thus normally suffering tedious synthesis. Herein, we report a trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8901;&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) using readily available 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;ethynylbenzenes as starting materials. This domino protocol features no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in a one&#8208;pot reaction. Mechanistic study revealed a unique domino radical anion pathway. Single crystal structure analysis of unsymmetric DBTDT shows that its unique unsymmetric structure endows rich and multiple weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules, which enables the large intermolecular transfer integrals of 86&#8197;meV and efficient charge transport performance with a carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This study provides a facile and highly efficient synthetic strategy for more high&#8208;performance unsymmetric organic semiconductors.

         <title>Independent Multiple&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Functionality in Composition Adjustable Immiscible Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt Solid&#8208;Solution High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for NOx Reduction Outperforming Rh</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared homogeneous Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt high&#8208;entropy solid solutions with adjustable compositisions as multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts for NOx reduction. The elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover were well&#8208;coupled on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, mainly responsible for the superior activities over pure Rh.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with four, five or more metals significantly can yield the developments of functional materials with excellent performances in various reactions. However, the underlying reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis for HEA have been rarely investigated, due to their diverse elements and complex compositions. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneously dispersed Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt HEA with adjustable compositions, as the multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (MASC). In the NOx reduction performance tests, Ru0.4 (Rh0.33Pd0.33Pt0.33)0.6 MASC showed the highest activity, which was significantly improved compared to that of the best monometal Rh, with the light&#8208;off temperature decreasing by ca. 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the outstanding activity of Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt MASC was attributable to the well&#8208;coupled elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, which explained the first clear reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis for HEA.

         <title>A Hybrid Redox&#8208;Mediated Zinc&#8208;Air Fuel Cell for Scalable and Sustained Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell that liberates the zinc reaction from the electrode to a separate fuel tank was demonstrated, which enabled a facile zinc refueling in the tank and attained a record&#8208;high power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah by optimizing system kinetics. The zinc evolution mechanism during redox&#8208;mediated reaction was unveiled for the first time using various in situ characterization techniques.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have attracted considerable attention for their high energy density, safety, low noise, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, the capacity of mechanically rechargeable ZABs was limited by the cumbersome procedure for replacing the zinc anode, while electrically rechargeable ZABs suffer from issues including low depth of discharge, zinc dendrite and dead zinc formation, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, etc. To address these issues, we report a hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell (HRM&#8208;ZAFC) utilizing 7,8&#8208;dihydroxyphenazine&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (DHPS) as the anolyte redox mediator, which shifts the zinc oxidation reaction from the electrode surface to a separate fuel tank. This approach decouples fuel feeding and electricity generation, providing greater operation flexibility and scalability for large&#8208;scale power generation applications. The DHPS&#8208;mediated ZAFC exhibited a superior peak power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and a continuous discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah with ZnO as the discharge product in the tank, highlighting its potential for power generation.

         <title>Glutathione Induced In situ Synthesis of Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Anaerobic Glycolysis Metabolism Interference for Boosting Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ synthesis strategy for Cu single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8722;O2/Cu&#8722;O4). The in situ activation process specifically disturbed copper metabolism pathway, thereby leading to enhanced copper deposition in cytoplasm for boosted cuproptosis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) has sparked increasing interest for catalytic antitumor treatment due to their more tunable and diverse active sites than natural metalloenzymes in complex physiological conditions. However, it is usually a hard task to precisely conduct catalysis at tumor sites after intravenous injection of those SAzyme with high reactivity. Moreover, the explorations of SAzymes in the anticancer application are still in its infancy and need to be developed. Herein, an in situ synthesis strategy for Cu SAzyme was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8722;O2/Cu&#8722;O4) via GSH&#8208;responsive deformability of supports. Our results suggest that the in situ activation process could further facilitate the dissociation of copper ions and the consumption of glutathione, thereby leading to copper deposition in cytoplasm and triggering cuproptosis. Moreover, the in situ synthesis of Cu SAzyme with peroxidase&#8208;like activity enabled the intracellular reactive oxygen species production, resulting in specifically disturbance of copper metabolism pathway. Meanwhile, the in situ exposed glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor phloretin (Ph) can block the glycose uptake to boost cuproptosis efficacy. Overall, this in situ activation strategy effectively diminished the off&#8208;target effects of SACs&#8208;induced catalytic therapies and introduced a promising treatment paradigm for advancing cuproptosis&#8208;associated therapies.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;Automated, High&#8208;Throughput Approach for the Synthesis and Identification of Highly Photo&#8208;Cytotoxic Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 90 iridium(III) complexes has been obtained via a combinatorial synthetic approach. The biophysical and cellular properties of the compounds have been studied using automated workflows, allowing us to identify compounds that are well tolerated in the dark but display nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. DFT calculations have been used to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data.







Abstract
The discovery of new compounds with pharmacological properties is usually a lengthy, laborious and expensive process. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing workflows that allow for the rapid synthesis and evaluation of libraries of compounds with the aim of identifying leads for further drug development. Herein, we apply combinatorial synthesis to build a library of 90&#8197;iridium(III) complexes (81 of which are new) over two synthesise&#8208;and&#8208;test cycles, with the aim of identifying potential agents for photodynamic therapy. We demonstrate the power of this approach by identifying highly active complexes that are well&#8208;tolerated in the dark but display very low nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. To build a detailed structure&#8211;activity relationship for this class of compounds we have used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data. Finally, we present an optimised semi&#8208;automated synthesise&#8208;and&#8208;test protocol to obtain multiplex data within 72&#8197;hours.

         <title>Biocatalytic Steroidal 9&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation and Fragmentation Enable the Concise Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Secosteroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ten 9,10&#8208;secosteroids were synthesized from readily available steroids in three to eight steps via a chemoenzymatic approach. The key feature lies in utilizing the Rieske oxygenase 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as a biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through a 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade.







Abstract
9,10&#8208;Secosteroids are an important group of marine steroids with diverse biological activities. Herein, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for the concise, modular, and scalable synthesis of ten naturally occurring 9,10&#8208;secosteroids from readily available steroids in three to eight steps. The key feature lies in utilizing a Rieske oxygenase&#8208;like 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as the biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation. With synthesized 9,10&#8208;secosteroides, structure&#8211;activity relationship was evaluated based on bioassays in terms of previously unexplored anti&#8208;infective activity. This study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway through which 9,10&#8208;secosteroids are formed in nature shares a similar 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade. In addition to the development of a biomimetic approach for 9,10&#8208;secosteroid synthesis, this study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Siderophore Mimics Convey Nucleic Acid Therapeutics into Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic siderophores are conjugated to antibacterial antisense sequences to efficiently deliver them into bacteria. The conjugates display effective protein downregulation and potent antibacterial properties. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore demonstrate transport through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway.







Abstract
Antibacterial resistance is a major threat for human health. There is a need for new antibacterials to stay ahead of constantly&#8208;evolving resistant bacteria. Nucleic acid therapeutics hold promise as powerful antibiotics, but issues with their delivery hamper their applicability. Here, we exploit the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway to efficiently transport antisense oligomers into bacteria. We appended a synthetic siderophore to antisense oligomers targeting the essential acpP gene in Escherichia coli. Siderophore&#8208;conjugated PNA and PMO antisense oligomers displayed potent antibacterial properties. Conjugates bearing a minimal siderophore consisting of a mono&#8208;catechol group showed equally effective. Targeting the lacZ transcript resulted in dose&#8208;dependent decreased &#946;&#8208;galactosidase production, demonstrating selective protein downregulation. Applying this concept to Acinetobacter baumannii also showed concentration&#8208;dependent growth inhibition. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore verified selective uptake through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway. Lastly, no toxicity towards mammalian cells was found. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that large nucleic acid therapeutics can be efficiently transported into bacteria using synthetic siderophore mimics.

         <title>Robust, Ultrafast and Reversible Photoswitching in Bulk Polymers Enabled by Octupolar Molecule Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octupolar design paradigm is introduced to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs). Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers. This together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing enables versatile uses of MOPSAs as smart inks or labels for diverse applications.







Abstract
Improving the photoswitching rate and robustness of photochromic molecules in bulk solids is paramount for practical applications but remains an on&#8208;going challenge. Here, we introduce an octupolar design paradigm to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs) featuring a C3&#8208;symmetrical A3&#8208;(D&#8208;core) architecture with a dipolar donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) photochrome in each branch. Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to enable robust ultrafast reversible photoswitching in bulk polymers. Specifically, the optimal MOPSA (4&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in commercial polyurethane films accomplishes nearly 100&#8201;% discoloration in 6&#8197;s under visible light with &#8764; 100&#8201;% thermal&#8208;recovery in 17.4&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C, while the acquired kinetics constants are 3&#8764;7&#8197;times that of dipolar DASA counterpart and 1&#8764;2&#8197;orders of magnitude higher than those of reported DASAs in polymers. Importantly, the MOPSA&#8208;doped polymer films sustain 500 discoloration/recovery cycles with slow degradation, superior to the existing DASAs in polymers (&#8804;30&#8197;cycles). We discover that multi&#8208;dipolar coupling in MOPSA enables enhanced polarization and electron delocalization, promoting the rate&#8208;determining thermal cyclization, while the branched and non&#8208;planar geometry of MOPSA induces large free volume to facilitate the isomerization. This design can be extended to develop spiropyran or azobenzene&#8208;based ultrafast photochromic films. The superior photoswitching performance of MOPSAs together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing inspires us to explore their versatile uses as smart inks or labels for time&#8208;temperature indicators, optical logic encryption and multi&#8208;levelled data encryption.

         <title>Probing Coordination Number of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by d&#8208;Band Center&#8208;Regulated Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the d&#8208;band center as a bridge, the correlation between the coordination number (CN) and the acetone cataluminescence (CTL) was establised. A versatile d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone CTL platform was thus developed for the rapid measurement of the CN of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).







Abstract
It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X&#8208;ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt&#8208;SACs. It is disclosed that the CN&#8208;triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d&#8208;band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone&#8208;CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe&#8208;SACs.

     alt="Probing Coordination Number of Single-Atom Catalysts by d-Band Center-Regulated Luminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center as a bridge, the correlation between the coordination number (CN) and the acetone cataluminescence (CTL) was establised. A versatile &lt;i&gt;d-&lt;/i&gt;band center-regulated acetone CTL platform was thus developed for the rapid measurement of the CN of single-atom catalysts (SACs).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X-ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a &lt;i&gt;d-&lt;/i&gt;band center-regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt-SACs. It is disclosed that the CN-triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone-CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe-SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center-regulated CTL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exfoliation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Give 2D MOF Nanosheets for the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to synthesize ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is developed by selective thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. This method advances the precise control of chemical bonds to give materials that are shown to be active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The structure and properties of materials are determined by a diverse range of chemical bond formation and breaking mechanisms, which greatly motivates the development of selectively controlling the chemical bonds in order to achieve materials with specific characteristics. Here, an orientational intervening bond&#8208;breaking strategy is demonstrated for synthesizing ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets through balancing the process of thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. In such approach, proper thermal treatment can weaken the interlayer bond while maintaining the stability of the intralayer bond in the layered MOFs. And the following liquid nitrogen treatment results in significant deformation and stress in the layered MOFs&#8217; structure due to the instant temperature drop and drastic expansion of liquid N2, leading to the curling, detachment, and separation of the MOF layers. The produced MOF nanosheets with five cycles of treatment are primarily composed of nanosheets that are less than 10&#8197;nm in thickness. The MOF nanosheets exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reactions owing to the ultrathin thickness without capping agents which provide improved charge transfer efficiency and dense exposed active sites. This strategy underscores the significance of orientational intervention in chemical bonds to engineer innovative materials.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Electron Redistribution in Lattice&#8208;matched Biphasic Ni3N&#8208;Co3N for Energy&#8208;efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production via Coupled Hydrazine Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;purity and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density green hydrogen through water electrolysis holds immense promise, but issues such as electrocatalyst costs and power consumption have hampered its practical application. In this study, we present a promising solution to these challenges through the use of a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production via coupled hydrazine degradation. The biphasic metal nitrides with highly lattice&#8208;matched structures are deliberately constructed, forming an enhanced local electric field between the electron&#8208;rich Ni3N and electron&#8208;deficient Co3N. Additionally, Mn is introduced as an electric field engine to further activate electron redistribution. Our Mn@Ni3N&#8208;Co3N/NF bifunctional electrocatalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade current densities of 500 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.49 V without degradation, saving at least 53.3% energy consumption compared to conventional alkaline water electrolysis. This work will stimulate the further development of metal nitride electrocatalysts and also provide new perspectives on low&#8208;cost hydrogen production and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Heteroatom Coordination and Hydrogen Evolution for Single&#8208;site Pt on Carbon&#8208;based Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs) is closely correlated with the electronic structure of metal atoms. Herein we construct a series of Pt SSCs on undoped and heteroatom&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, which exhibit increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along S&#8208;, P&#8208;, C&#8208; and N&#8208;coordinated Pt SSCs. Theoretical simulation indicates a multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process on Pt SSCs due to the low coordination, and a new descriptor, i.e., &#916;GH(4) (the adsorption energy of the 4th H), is figured out to evaluate the HER activities. Relative to C&#8208; coordinated Pt, N&#8208;coordinated Pt has higher reactivity due to the electron transfer of N&#8208;to&#8208;Pt, which enriches the density of states of Pt 5d orbital near the Fermi level and facilitates the capturing of protons, just the opposite to the situations for P&#8208; and S&#8208;coordinated ones. The stable N&#8208;coordinated Pt originates from the kinetic stability throughout the multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process. The experimental progress and theoretical understanding in this study provides a deep insight into the correlation of heteroatom coordination and hydrogen evolution, which is significant for the rational design of advanced Pt SSCs on carbon&#8208;based supports.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective photoreduction of CO2 to multicarbon products, is an important but challenging task, due to high CO2 activation barriers and insufficient catalytic sites for C&#8211;C coupling. Herein, a defect engineering strategy for incorporating copper sites into the connected nodes of defective metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for selective overall photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 into acetone. The Cu2+ site in well&#8208;modified CuN2O2 units served as a trapping site to capture electrons via efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, forming the active Cu+ site for CO2 reduction. Two NH2 groups in the CuN2O2 unit adsorb CO2 and cooperated with copper ion to functionalize as a triple atom catalytic site, each interacting with one CO2 molecule to strengthen the binding of *CO intermediate to catalytic site. The deoxygenated *CO attached to Cu site interacted with *CH3 fixed at one amino group to form the key intermediate CO*&#8208;CH3, which interacted with the third reduction intermediate on another amino group to produce acetone. Our photocatalyst realizes efficient overall CO2 reduction to C3 product acetone CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a selectivity up to 97% without any adducts, offering a promising avenue for designing triple&#8208;atomic sites to producing C3 product from photosynthesis with water.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanocloaks on Cancer Cells Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid system (LMP vaccine) that is based on living cancer cells and a manganese&#8208;phenolic nanocloak is developed for synergistic immunotherapy. The nanocloak affords an immunoactive exoskeleton by integrating the toll&#8208;like receptor ligand to enhance dendritic cell engulfment and Mn2+ ions to sensitize the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to superior therapeutic efficacy against melanoma.

Due to the presence of natural neoantigens, autologous tumor cells hold great promise as personalized therapeutic vaccines. Yet autologous tumor cell vaccines require multi&#8208;step production that frequently leads to the loss of immunoreactive antigens, causing insufficient immune activation and significantly hampering their clinical applications. Herein, we introduce a novel whole&#8208;cell cancer vaccine by cloaking cancer cells with lipopolysaccharide&#8208;decorated manganese(II)&#8208;phenolic networks (MnTA nanocloaks) to evoke tumor&#8208;specific immune response for highly efficacious synergistic cancer immunotherapy. The natural polyphenols coordinate with Mn2+ and immediately adhere to the surface of individual cancer cells, thereby forming a nanocloak and encapsulating tumor neoantigens. Subsequent decoration with lipopolysaccharide induces internalization by dendritic cells, where Mn2+ ions are released in the cytosol, further facilitating the activation of the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway. Highly effective tumor suppression was observed by combining the nanocloaked cancer cell treatment with anti&#8208;programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) antibodies&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our work demonstrates a universal yet simple strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;based nanobiohybrid system for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Switching from Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Single Crystals for Low&#8208;Threshold Laser to Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence in Amorphous&#8208;Film for Highly Efficient OLEDs</title>

Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires of tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (DtCzBF2) enabled thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and low&#8208;threshold microlasers. In contrast, its guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films exhibited organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) with a PLQY up to 61&#8201;%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with external quantum efficiency approaching 18.6&#8201;%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes containing Ir or Pt are work horse in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons in electroluminescence (EL) owing to strong heavy&#8208;atom effect. Recently, organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) have achieved high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in rigid crystalline state, which, however, is unsuitable for OLED fabrication, therefore leading to an EL efficiency far low behind those of metal&#8208;organic phosphorescent complexes. Here, we reported a luminescence mechanism switch from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in single crystal microwires to ORTP in amorphous thin&#8208;films, based on a tert&#8208;butylcarbazole difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate derivative of DtCzBF2. Tightly packed and well&#8208;faceted single&#8208;crystal microwires exhibit aggregation induced emission (AIE), enabling TADF microlasers at 473&#8197;nm with an optical gain coefficient as high as 852&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, loosely packed dimers of DtCzBF2 formed in guest&#8208;host amorphous thin&#8208;films decrease the oscillator strength of fluorescence transition but stabilize triplets for ORTP with a PLQY up to 61&#8201;%, leading to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with EQE approaching 20&#8201;%. This study opens possibilities of low&#8208;cost ORTP emitters for high performance OLEDs and future low&#8208;threshold electrically injected organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs).

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Electrochemical Sensors Facilitate the Study of DNA Binding by Platinum (II)&#8208;based Antineoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors unveil the DNA binding mechanisms of platinum(II) complexes. Based on signals generated at dual frequencies of square wave voltammetry upon introduction of platinum(II) antineoplastics, the sensors can resolve formation of monovalent adducts and bivalent adducts on the purine&#8208;rich DNA sequences.







Abstract
DNA crosslinking agents such as cisplatin and related platinum(II) analogs are effective drugs to treat solid tumors. However, these therapeutics can cause high toxicity in the body, and tumors can develop resistance to them. To develop less toxic and more effective DNA crosslinkers, medicinal chemists have focused on tuning the ligands in square planar platinum(II) complexes to modulate their bioavailability, targeted cell penetration, and DNA binding rates. Unfortunately, linking in vitro DNA binding capacity of DNA crosslinkers with their in vivo efficacy has proven challenging. Here we report an electrochemical biosensor strategy that allows the study of platinum(II)&#8208;DNA binding in real time. Our biosensors contain a purine&#8208;rich deoxynucleotide sequence, T6(AG)10, modified with a 5&#8217; hexylthiol linker for easy self&#8208;assembly onto gold electrodes. The 3&#8217; terminus is functionalized with the redox reporter methylene blue. Electron transfer from methylene blue to the sensor is a function of platinum(II) compound concentration and reaction time. Using these biosensors, we resolve DNA binding mechanisms including monovalent and bivalent binding, as well as base stacking. Our approach can measure DNA binding kinetics in buffers and in 50&#8201;% serum, offering a single&#8208;step, real&#8208;time approach to screen therapeutic compounds during drug development.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric nickel/metallaphotoredox catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H benzylic carbamoylation employing alkylarenes and isocyanates is described. A broad array of 2&#8208;arylamides can be prepared in one pot under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the rate and stereodetermining step of this transformation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated Hydrogen Atom Abstraction of Csp3&#8722;H bonds has become a powerful tool for the asymmetric functionalization of organic feedstocks. Here, we present an asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides via carbamoylation of alkylarenes with isocyanates as electrophiles. The synergistic combination of a photoredox and a chiral nickel&#8208;catalyst, enables the use of readily available and neutral reagents under mild reaction conditions and provides straightforward access to pharmacologically relevant motifs in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular assembly can be designed by fusing binding domains. A precise optimization of the level of compaction of the assembly using linker of different lengths or compositions can provide a simple strategy to program their assembly properties (e.g., midpoint, dynamic range, and inhibition). The thermodynamic and mechanistic principles demonstrated herein also shine light behind the evolution of biological molecular assembly.







Abstract
Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50&#8197;years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutant cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.

         <title>Water&#8208;Degradable Oxygen&#8208;Rich Polymers with AB/ABB Units from Fast and Selective Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time report the copolymerization of formaldehyde and cyclic anhydride, which is fast and chemo&#8208;selective under mild conditions using common acids as catalysts. The versatile method yields a series of sustainable polymers with tunable AB/ABB units, which can be completely degraded into valuable diacids in water or seawater at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Researchers have been chasing plastics that can automatically and fully degrade into valuable products under natural conditions. Here, we develop a series of water&#8208;degradable polymers from the first reported fast and selective cationic copolymerization of formaldehyde (B) with cyclic anhydrides (A). In addition to readily accessible monomers, the method is performed at industrially relevant temperatures (~100&#8201;&#176;C), takes tens or even minutes, and uses common acid as the catalyst. Interestingly, such polymers possess tunable AB/ABB&#8208;type repeating units, which are considered to be thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively, resulting in low carbon content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 1&#8201;:&#8201;1). Notably, the polymers can completely degrade to valuable diacids within 150&#8197;days in water at ambient temperature owing to the incorporation of carboxyl terminals and acid&#8208;responsive acetal units. By washing with aqueous sodium carbonate, the polymers are relatively stable over several months.

         <title>Pulse Electrolysis Turns on CO2 Methanation through N&#8208;Confused Cupric Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulse potential electrolysis bolsters the methane selectivity on N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin by 3&#8208;fold through promoted water dissociation, aggrandized OH&#8722; consumption and thereby populated protons at high anodic bias.







Abstract
Breaking the D4h symmetry in the square&#8208;planar M&#8722;N4 configuration of macrocycle molecular catalysts has witnessed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, but at the expense of electrochemical stability. Herein, we hypothesize that the lability of the active Cu&#8722;N3 motifs in the N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CuNCP) could be overcome by applying pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE) during electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. We find that applying PPE can indeed enhance the CH4 selectivity on CuNCP by 3 folds to reach the partial current density of 170&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &gt;60&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in flow cell. However, combined ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR), Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations reveal that, in a prolonged time scale, the decomplexation of CuNCP is unavoidable, and the promoted water dissociation under high anodic bias with lowered pH and enriched protons facilitates successive hydrogenation of *CO on the irreversibly reduced Cu nanoparticles, leading to the improved CH4 selectivity. As a key note, this study signifies the adaption of electrolytic protocol to the catalyst structure for tailoring local chemical environment towards efficient CO2 reduction.

         <title>Photoswitchable PROTACs for Reversible and Spatiotemporal Regulation of NAMPT and NAD+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first activator&#8208;based photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PS&#8208;PROTAC) was developed for the optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems. The novel PS&#8208;PROTAC enabled the reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+, resulting in a significant reduction in target&#8208;related toxicity compared to conventional NAMPT degraders or inhibitors. Furthermore, PS&#8208;PROTAC allowed for the in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT, and NAD+.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential coenzyme with diverse biological functions in DNA synthesis. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in mammals. We developed the first chemical tool for optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems using photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PS&#8208;PROTACs). An NAMPT activator and dimethylpyrazolazobenzene photoswitch were used to design highly efficient PS&#8208;PROTACs, enabling up&#8208; and down&#8208;reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+ in a light&#8208;dependent manner and reducing the toxicity associated with inhibitor&#8208;based PS&#8208;PROTACs. PS&#8208;PROTAC was activated under 620&#8197;nm irradiation, realizing in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT, and NAD+.

         <title>Coarse&#8208;Grained Model&#8208;Assisted Design of Polymer Prodrug Nanoparticles with Enhanced Cytotoxicity: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting relative drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation has been developed. This hypothesis was experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs, which demonstrated greater drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines.







Abstract
To achieve drug release from polymer prodrug nanoparticles, the drug&#8208;polymer linker must be accessible for cleavage to release the drug, which can occur under certain physiological conditions (e.g., presence of specific enzymes). Supramolecular organization of polymer prodrug nanoparticles is crucial as it greatly affects the location of the linker, its surface exposure/solvation and thus its cleavage to release the drug. Since experimental access to these data is not straightforward, new methodologies are critically needed to access this information and to accelerate the development of more effective polymer prodrug nanoparticles, and replace the time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategy. In this context, we reported here the use of a coarse&#8208;grained model to assist the design of polymer prodrug nanoparticles with enhanced cytotoxicity. By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, we developed an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation. Our hypothesis was then experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs (gemcitabine and paclitaxel), which demonstrated greater performances in terms of drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines. Interestingly, our methodology can be easily applied to other polymer prodrug structures, which would contribute to the development of more efficient drug delivery systems via in silico screening.

         <title>Cubic Iodide LixYI3+x Superionic Conductors through Defect Manipulation for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating defects within a highly symmetric iodide crystal has successfully yielded a remarkable ionic conductivity exceeding 1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature in a novel Li4YI7 solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This achievement not only demonstrates its promising compatibility with lithium metal but also enables the realization of high&#8208;performance iodide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide SEs receiving less attention. Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x=2, 3, 4, or 9). Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C for Li4YI7. Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.

&lt;p&gt;Manipulating defects within a highly symmetric iodide crystal has successfully yielded a remarkable ionic conductivity exceeding 1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature in a novel Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;YI&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; solid-state electrolyte. This achievement not only demonstrates its promising compatibility with lithium metal but also enables the realization of high-performance iodide-based all-solid-state lithium batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide SEs receiving less attention. Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti-reduction stability, respectively. Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;YI&lt;sub&gt;3+x&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=2, 3, 4, or 9). Through synchrotron X-ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;YI&lt;sub&gt;3+x&lt;/sub&gt; SEs belong to the high-symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li-ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C for Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;YI&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the promising Li-metal compatibility of Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;YI&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all-solid-state Li-S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Global Reactivity Profiling of the Catalytic Lysine in Human Kinome for Covalent Inhibitor Development</title>

Lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes based on aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) are reported, enabling successful profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases and providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the human kinome. Introduction of these aminophiles into a noncovalent Aurora A kinase inhibitor led to novel lysine&#8208;reactive inhibitors that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and cellular activities with prolonged residence time.







Abstract
Advances in targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) have been made by using lysine&#8208;reactive chemistries. Few aminophiles possessing balanced reactivity/stability for the development of cell&#8208;active TCIs are however available. We report herein lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; 2&#8211;14) based on the chemistry of aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) capable of global reactivity profiling of the catalytic lysine in human kinome from mammalian cells. We concurrently developed reversible covalent ABPs (15/16) by installing salicylaldehydes (SA) onto a promiscuous kinase&#8208;binding scaffold. The stability and amine reactivity of these probes exhibited a broad range of tunability. X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the successful covalent engagement between ArOSO2F on 9 and the catalytic lysine of SRC kinase. Chemoproteomic studies enabled the profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases, thus providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the kinome. By further introducing these aminophiles into VX&#8208;680 (a noncovalent inhibitor of AURKA kinase), we generated novel lysine&#8208;reactive TCIs that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and reasonable cellular activities with prolonged residence time. Our work serves as a general guide for the development of lysine&#8208;reactive ArOSO2F&#8208;based TCIs.

         <title>Discovery and Mechanistic Elucidation of NQO1&#8208;Bioactivatable Small Molecules That Overcome Resistance to Degraders</title>

The small molecule RBS&#8208;10 exploits a novel synthetic lethal vulnerability in cancer cells that show widespread resistance to degraders.







Abstract
Degraders hold the promise to efficiently inactivate previously intractable disease&#8208;relevant targets. Unlike traditional inhibitors, degraders act substoichiometrically and rely on the hijacked proteolysis machinery, which can also act as an entry point for resistance. To fully harness the potential of targeted protein degradation, it is crucial to comprehend resistance mechanisms and formulate effective strategies to overcome them. We conducted a chemical screening to identify synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cancer cells that exhibit widespread resistance to degraders. Comparative profiling followed by tailored optimization delivered the small molecule RBS&#8208;10, which shows preferential cytotoxicity against cells pan&#8208;resistant to degraders. Multiomics deconvolution of the mechanism of action revealed that RBS&#8208;10 acts as a prodrug bioactivated by the oxidoreductase enzyme NQO1, which is highly overexpressed in our resistance models. Collectively, our work informs on NQO1 as an actionable vulnerability to overcome resistance to degraders and as a biomarker to selectively exploit bioactivatable prodrugs in cancer.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Regulated Cathode with Low Strain and Constraint Phase&#8208;Change Toward Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The successful implementation of an entropy&#8208;regulation approach is proposed by using PBAs as cathode for aqueous AIBs, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. As&#8208;designed medium&#8208;entropy cathode could deliver a high capacity for reversible Al3+ storage, which is attributed to the activation of numerous redox centres and low strain, further enabling ultra&#8208;high rates of ion storage and an exceptionally long lifespan.







Abstract
During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high&#8208;performance reversible Al3+ storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) suffer severely from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy&#8208;driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME&#8208;PBAs) host. By multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al3+ storage. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M&#8722;N bond intensity, which is beneficial for constraining the phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME&#8208;PBA lattice parameters is only 1.2&#8201;%. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The findings highlight that, the entropy regulation strategy could uncover the isochronous constraint on both strain and phase transition for long&#8208;term reversible Al3+ storage, providing a promising design for advanced electrode materials for aqueous multivalent ions batteries.

         <title>The Reverse of Electrostatic Interaction Force for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy Al&#8208;Ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8722;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8722;. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge, which is a breakthrough for achieving ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density aluminum&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries by tuning surface charge of electrode materials.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes with sufficient interlayer spacing are promising cathode materials for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), yet the electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8722;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8722; and is usually ignored. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge. By doping N and Co, the zeta potential is gradually transformed from negative (Ti3C2Tx) to near&#8208;neutral (Ti3CNTx), and finally positive (Ti3CNTx@Co). Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion force can be greatly weakened between Ti3CNTx and AlCl4&#8722;, or even formed a strong electrostatic attraction between Ti3CNTx@Co and AlCl4&#8722;, which can not only accommodate more AlCl4&#8722; ions in the Ti3CNTx@Co interlayers to increase the capacity, but also solve the stacking and expansion problems. As a result, the optimized Al&#8208;MXene battery exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of up to 240&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;4&#8197;times the capacity of graphite cathode, 60&#8211;120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a potential ultrahigh energy density (432&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, 2&#8211;4&#8197;times the value of graphite, 110&#8211;220&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) based on the mass of cathode materials, comparable to LiFePO4&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries (350&#8211;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the mass of LiFePO4).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-dimensional (2D) MXenes with sufficient interlayer spacing are promising cathode materials for aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs), yet the electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and is usually ignored. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge. By doping N and Co, the zeta potential is gradually transformed from negative (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) to near-neutral (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and finally positive (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@Co). Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion force can be greatly weakened between Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or even formed a strong electrostatic attraction between Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@Co and AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Biodegradable Monometallic Aluminum as a Biotuner for Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable monometallic Al is used for the first time as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. Al reacts with H+ to form H2 and Al3+, which not only remodels the TME but also enables its degradation. H2 and Al3+ disrupt redox balance and ionic homeostasis, inducing the generation of abundant ROS, which activates ROS&#8208;responsive prodrugs, ultimately achieving efficient tumor therapy.







Abstract
Pyroptosis is an effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy. However, monometallic pyroptosis biotuners have not been explored until now. Here, we discover for the first time that biodegradable monometallic Al can act as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. pH&#8208;sensitive Al nanoparticles (Al@P) are obtained by equipping polyethylene glycol&#8208;b&#8208;(poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8208;co&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine), which can exert their effect at the tumor site without affecting normal cells. The H2 and Al3+ release by Al@P in the acidic environment of tumors disrupts the redox balance and ionic homeostasis in tumor cells, thus generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to caspase&#8208;1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, and IL&#8208;1&#946;/LDH release, which induces canonical pyroptotic death. Meanwhile, the prodrug Doxorubicin (Pro&#8208;DOX) is successfully loaded onto Al@P (Al@P&#8208;P) and can be activated by ROS to release DOX in the tumor cells, thus further improving the tumor&#8208;killing efficiency. Ultimately, Al@P&#8208;P is degradable and exhibits efficient tumor inhibition.

         <title>The Structural Role of N170 in Substrate&#8208;Assisted Deacylation in KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;Lactamase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) alter its structure and function and can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics. Accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations have now revealed that in D179 variants of KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;lactamase, the N170 side chain can rotate away from the active site, allowing the binding of antibiotics such as moxalactam and ceftazidime.







Abstract
The amino acid substitutions in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) that have arisen in the clinic are observed to lead to the development of resistance to ceftazidime&#8208;avibactam, a preferred treatment for KPC bearing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) result in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, leading to alterations in substrate specificity, decreased stability, and more recently observed, increased resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam. Using accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations, we explored in detail the structural role of R164 and D179 variants that are described to confer ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The buried conformation of D179 substitutions produce a pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop &#8208; more than R164 mutants, where the crystallographic omega loop structure remains mostly intact. Our findings also reveal that the conformation of N170 plays an underappreciated role impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation. The results further support the hypothesis that KPC&#8208;2 D179 variants employ substrate&#8208;assisted catalysis for ceftazidime hydrolysis, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover. Moreover, the shift in the WT conformation of N170 contributes to reduced deacylation and an altered spectrum of enzymatic activity.

         <title>High&#8208;nuclearity Luminescent Lanthanide Nanocages for Tumor Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 60&#8208;metal lanthanide nanocages (Ln60, Ln=Eu and Tb) constructed from Schiff base ligands were used as molecular drug delivery agents (DOX@Ln60, DOX=doxorubicin). They provided for effective tumor therapy in a murine model with negligible side effects. Moreover, DOX@Ln60 proved luminescent and efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing these cells to be readily visualized.







Abstract
There is an unmet need for easy&#8208;to&#8208;visualize drug carriers that can deliver therapeutic cargoes deep into solid tumors. Herein, we report the preparation of ultrasmall luminescent imine&#8208;based lanthanide nanocages, Eu60 and Tb60 (collectively Ln60), designed to encapsulate anticancer chemotherapeutics for tumor therapy. The as&#8208;prepared nanocages possess large cavities suitable for the encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX), yielding DOX@Ln60 nanocages with diameters around 5&#8197;nm. DOX@Ln60 are efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing the cells to be visualized via the intrinsic luminescent property of Ln(III). Once internalized, the acidic intracellular microenvironment promotes imine bond cleavage and the release of the loaded DOX. DOX@Ln60 inhibits DNA replication and triggers tumor cell apoptosis. In a murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, DOX@Ln60 was found to inhibit tumor growth with negligible side effects on normal tissues. It proved more effective than various controls, including DOX and Ln60. The present nanocages thus point the way to the development of precise nanomedicines for tumor imaging and therapy.

This work presents the phase transfer of hydrophobic clusters into the aqueous phase with maintained emission intensities via the supramolecular recoupling of emissive Ag29 nanoclusters with atomic precision.







Abstract
Exploiting emissive hydrophobic nanoclusters for hydrophilic applications remains a challenge because of photoluminescence (PL) quenching during phase transfer. In addition, the mechanism underlying PL quenching remains unclear. In this study, the PL&#8208;quenching mechanism was examined by analyzing the atomically precise structures and optical properties of a surface&#8208;engineered Ag29 nanocluster with an all&#8208;around&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;functionalized surface. Specifically, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;triggered PL quenching was justified as molecular decoupling, which directed an unfixed cluster surface and weakened the radiative transition. Furthermore, emission recovery of the quenched nanoclusters was accomplished by using a supramolecular recoupling approach through the glutathione&#8208;addition&#8208;induced aggregation of cluster molecules, wherein the restriction of intracluster motion and intercluster rotation strengthened the radiative transition of the clusters. The results of this work offer a new perspective on structure&#8208;emission correlations for atomically precise nanoclusters and hopefully provide insight into the fabrication of highly emissive cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for downstream hydrophilic applications.

         <title>Stress Dissipation Driven by Multi&#8208;Interface Built&#8208;In Electric Fields and Desert&#8208;Rose&#8208;Like Structure for Ultrafast and Superior Long&#8208;Term Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface BEFs and architected structure, is proposed to achieve compatibility between fast kinetics and structural stability in an anode. Based on this strategy, desert&#8208;rose&#8208;like HMI&#8208;MFS NRs with multiple interfaces and a staggered cantilever configuration at micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;scales are fabricated, which display ultrafast and superior long&#8208;term sodium ion storage in half/full SIBs.







Abstract
The kinetics and durability of conversion&#8208;based anodes greatly depend on the intrinsic stress regulating ability of the electrode materials, which has been significantly neglected. Herein, a stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface built&#8208;in electric fields (BEFs) and architected structure, is innovatively proposed to design ultrafast and long&#8208;term sodium ion storage anodes. Binary Mo/Fe sulfide heterostructured nanorods with multi&#8208;interface BEFs and staggered cantilever configuration are fabricated to prove our concept. Multi&#8208;physics simulations and experimental results confirm that the inner stress in multiple directions can be dissipated by the multi&#8208;interface BEFs at the micro&#8208;scale, and by the staggered cantilever structure at the macro&#8208;scale, respectively. As a result, our designed heterostructured nanorods anode exhibits superb rate capability (332.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and durable cyclic stability over 900 cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming other metal chalcogenides. This proposed stress dissipation strategy offers a new insight for developing stable structures for conversion&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Vinyl Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy for the direct conversion of aziridines into 2&#8208;vinyl azetidines via one&#8208;carbon insertion using vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is described. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Azetidines, being four&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value&#8208;added 2&#8208;alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step&#8208;economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate. Experimental investigations, coupled with computational studies, suggest that a diradical pathway is involved in the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Threading a Linear Molecule Through a Macrocycle Thanks to Boron: Optical Properties of the Threaded Species and Synthesis of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;containing species were threaded through macrocycles bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit. The new threaded species exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91&#8201;% and an enhanced photostability. Their properties were rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. This methodology was used to synthesize a rotaxane.







Abstract
Two BODIPYs and two boron &#946;&#8208;diketonates were threaded through a macrocycle bearing a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol unit, showing thus the ability of boron to act as a gathering atom. The new threaded species were characterized by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as by X&#8208;ray crystallography for one of them and their properties rationalized with quantum chemistry to unravel the vibronic contributions. The BODIPYs exhibited interesting fluorescence features with quantum yields up to 91&#8201;% and enhanced photostability compared to their non&#8208;threaded homologues. A rotaxane was synthesized using this threading strategy after stoppering and removing the boron with potassium hydroxide.

         <title>Hygroscopic Solutes Enable Non&#8208;van der Waals Electrolytes for Fire&#8208;Tolerant Dual&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the irreversible thermal transformation of electrolytes is typically attributed to solvent boiling, which disrupts solvent intermolecular interactions, our research revealed that hygroscopic solutes shift the determining factor to solute decomposition, breaking solute intramolecular bonds. As intramolecular bonds are much stronger, it enables ultrahigh thermal tolerance of non&#8208;van der Waals solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes.







Abstract
Thermal safety issues of batteries have hindered their large&#8208;scale applications. Nonflammable electrolytes improved safety but solvent evaporation above 100&#8201;&#176;C limited thermal tolerance, lacking reliability. Herein, fire&#8208;tolerant metal&#8208;air batteries were realized by introducing solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes whose hygroscopic solutes could spontaneously reabsorb the evaporated water solvent. Using Zn/CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air/carbon batteries as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, they failed upon burning at 631.8&#8201;&#176;C but self&#8208;recovered then by reabsorbing water from the air at room temperature. Different from conventional aqueous electrolytes whose irreversible thermal transformation is determined by the boiling points of solvents, solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes make this transformation determined by the much higher decomposition temperature of solutes. It was found that stronger intramolecular bonds instead of intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions were strongly correlated to ultra&#8208;high tolerance temperatures of our solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes. Our study would improve the understanding of the thermal properties of electrolytes, guide the design of solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, and enhance battery safety.

         <title>Operando Mobile Catalysis for Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>

Operando mobile catalysis enables the formation of mobile metal species during the reaction and enhances the catalytic efficiency by increasing the collision probability with the intermediates.







Abstract
Metal atoms on the support serve as active sites for many heterogeneous catalysts. However, the active metal sites on the support are conventionally described as static, and the intermediates adsorbed on the support far away from the active metal sites cannot be transformed. Herein, we report the first example of operando mobile catalysis to promote catalytic efficiency by enhancing the collision probability between active sites and reactants or reaction intermediates. Specifically, ligand&#8208;coordinated Pt single atoms (isolated MeCpPt&#8208; species) are bonded on CeO2 and transformed into mobile MeCpPt(H)CO complexes during the reverse water gas shift reaction for operando mobile catalysis. This strategy enables the conversion of inert carbonate intermediates on the CeO2 support. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 6358&#8197;mol&#8197;CO2&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 99&#8201;% CO selectivity at 300&#8201;&#176;C is obtained for reverse water gas shift reaction, dramatically higher than those of Pt catalysts reported in the literature. Operando mobile catalysis presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions and applications.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with over 19&#8201;% Efficiency and Enhanced Morphology Stability Enabled by Asymmetric Acceptors</title>

Asymmetric acceptor DT&#8208;C8Cl with functional haloalkyl chains was designed and synthesized, where noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively optimize the morphology and suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions, leading to simultaneously enhanced efficiency and morphology stability of organic solar cells.







Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercialization remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed asymmetric acceptors DT&#8208;C8Cl and DT&#8208;C8BTz with functional haloalkyl chains, in which the halogen atoms could induce noncovalent interactions with heteroatoms like O, S, and Se, etc., thus leading to appropriately manipulated film morphology. Consequently, binary devices based on D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40&#8201;%. The higher PCE of D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl could be attributed to the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. In addition, the noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions and thereby reduce trap density of states, leading to improved thermal and storage stability. Overall, our findings reveal that the rational design of asymmetric acceptors with functional haloalkyl chains is a novel and powerful strategy for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of OSCs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Disproportionation&#8208;Mediated Photodynamic Therapy: Simultaneous Oxidation of Tetrahydrobiopterin and Generation of Superoxide Radicals</title>

We report an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents capable of simultaneously oxidizing tetrahydrobiopterin and generating superoxide radicals.







Abstract
We herein present an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. As a proof of concept, BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers were rationally designed and prepared. The photo&#8208;induced intermolecular electron transfer between homotypic chromophores leads to the disproportionation reaction, resulting in the formation of charged intermediates, cationic and anionic radicals. The cationic radicals efficiently oxidize the cellularimportant coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and the anionic radicals transfer electrons to oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8901;). One of our Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents not only self&#8208;assembles in water but also effectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum. It displayed excellent photocytotoxicity even in highly hypoxic environments (2&#8201;% O2), with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.96&#8197;&#956;M, and demonstrated outstanding antitumor efficacy in murine models bearing HeLa tumors.

         <title>A Semisynthesis Platform for the Efficient Production and Exploration of Didemnin&#8208;Based Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform has been established for the exploration of didemnin&#8208;based drugs, combining microbial synthesis of didemnin B through genetic engineering of Tistrella mobilis and semisynthesis for the production of plitidepsin for drug purposes, didemnin derivatives for studying structure&#8211;activity relationships, and didemnin B probes for targeted protein profiling. This sustainable approach holds potential for investigating other marine natural products.







Abstract
Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anticancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Herein, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a Tistrella strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titer of approximately 75&#8197;mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B into plitidepsin, one of which involved a one&#8208;step synthetic route giving over 90&#8201;% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesized 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins. Our study highlights the synergistic potential of biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in overcoming the challenge of producing complex natural products sustainably and at scale.

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanopiperazines as Specific Covalent Inhibitors of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme UCHL1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanopiperazines as covalent enzyme inhibitors are disclosed. Extending on cyanopyrrolidines, reported cyanamides made of 6&#8208;membered rings display context&#8208;dependent reversibility and exquisite specificity for the deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL1 among human DUBs and the protein deglycase DJ&#8208;1/PARK7. Their mechanism of specificity is rationalized by a crystal structure, highlighting how protein reactivity of electrophilic compounds can be finetuned.







Abstract
Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross&#8208;reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ&#8208;1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl,N&#8208;cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with effective target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5&#8208;membered pyrrolidines to 6&#8208;membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context&#8208;dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound&#8208;induced conformational restriction of the cross&#8208;over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.

     alt="N-Cyanopiperazines as Specific Covalent Inhibitors of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme UCHL1"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanopiperazines as covalent enzyme inhibitors are disclosed. Extending on cyanopyrrolidines, reported cyanamides made of 6-membered rings display context-dependent reversibility and exquisite specificity for the deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL1 among human DUBs and the protein deglycase DJ-1/PARK7. Their mechanism of specificity is rationalized by a crystal structure, highlighting how protein reactivity of electrophilic compounds can be finetuned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross-reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ-1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose &lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with effective target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5-membered pyrrolidines to 6-membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context-dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound-induced conformational restriction of the cross-over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalysts under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) photolysis (&#955;max=525&#8197;nm), is described.

Abstract
This manuscript describes the development of alkyne addition to the aziridine moiety of aziridinoquinoxalines using dual Ir(III)/Cu(I) catalytic system under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) photolysis (&#955;max=525&#8197;nm). This mild method features high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity and was used to generate 30 highly functionalized substituted dihydroquinoxalines in 36&#8211;98&#8201;% yield. This transformation was also carried asymmetrically using phthalazinamine&#8208;based chiral ligand to provide 9&#8197;chiral addition products in 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 86&#8201;:&#8201;14 e.r. The experimental and quantum chemical explorations of this reaction suggest a mechanism that involves Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed triplet energy transfer followed by a ring&#8208;opening reaction ultimately leading to the formation of azomethine ylide intermediates. These azomethine intermediates undergo sequential protonation/copper(I) acetylide addition to provide the products.

         <title>Controlling Monoterpene Isomerization by Guiding Challenging Carbocation Rearrangement Reactions in Engineered Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocation&#8208;based rearrangements are vital for terpene versatility. AacSHC triterpene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius acted as a promiscuous catalyst for multiple monoterpene rearrangements. Tailored AacSHC variants directed the specific isomerization of pinene with exceptional selectivities. Success involved restructuring the aromatic active pocket and reorganizing water clusters to stabilize demanding carbocationic intermediates.







Abstract
The interconversion of monoterpenes is facilitated by a complex network of carbocation rearrangement pathways. Controlling these isomerization pathways is challenging when using common Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid catalysts, which often produce product mixtures that are difficult to separate. In contrast, natural monoterpene cyclases exhibit high control over the carbocation rearrangement reactions but are reliant on phosphorylated substrates. In this study, we present engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclases from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AacSHC) that catalyze the challenging isomerization of monoterpenes with unprecedented precision. Starting from a promiscuous isomerization of (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;pinene, we first demonstrate noticeable shifts in the product distribution solely by introducing single point mutations. Furthermore, we showcase the tuneable cation steering by enhancing (+)&#8208;borneol selectivity from 1&#8201;% to &gt;90&#8201;% (&gt;99&#8201;% de) aided by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Our combined experimental and computational data suggest that the reorganization of key aromatic residues leads to the restructuring of the water network that facilitates the selective termination of the secondary isobornyl cation. This work expands our mechanistic understanding of carbocation rearrangements and sets the stage for target&#8208;oriented skeletal reorganization of broadly abundant terpenes.

         <title>Spin&#8208;state Conversion by Asymmetrical Orbital Hybridization in Ni&#8208;doped Co3O4 to Boost Singlet Oxygen Generation for Microbial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of Ni into the octahedral site of Co3O4 effectively induced a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition, thereby enhancing the activity of 1O2 generation. We further explored the spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions between the catalysts and intermediates, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the 1O2 generation. This work deepens the understanding about orbital interactions and spin states.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role in environmental and biomedical disinfection fields. Electrocatalytic processes hold great potential for 1O2 generation, but remain challenging. Herein, a facile Ni doping converted spin&#8208;state transition approach is reported for boosting 1O2 production. Magnetic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that Ni occupied at the octahedral site of Co3O4 can effectively induce a low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin&#8208;state transition. The high&#8208;spin Ni&#8722;Co3O4 generate appropriate binding strength and enhance electron transfer between the Co centers with oxygen intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic activity of Ni&#8722;Co3O4 for effective generating 1O2. In neutral conditions, 1&#215;106&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 Gram&#8208;negative ESBL&#8208;producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) could be inactivated by Ni&#8722;Co3O4 system within 5&#8197;min. Further antibacterial mechanisms indicate that 1O2 can lead to cell membrane damage and DNA degradation so as to irreversible cell death. Additionally, the developed Ni&#8722;Co3O4 system can effectively inactivate bacteria from wastewater and bioaerosols. This work provides an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;spin electrocatalysis to boost 1O2 generation for disinfection process.

         <title>A Potentiometric Dual&#8208;Channel Microsensor Reveals that Fluctuation of H2S is Less pH&#8208;Dependent During Spreading Depolarization in the Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the mechanism of spreading depolarization (SD) is essential for the therapy of SD associated diseases. We report a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous detection of H2S and pH, enabling the first observation of H2S fluctuation induced by SD in vivo. Our work provides the direct experimental evidence that the H2S release during SD in rat cortex is less pH&#8208;dependent, possibly by modulating enzyme&#8208;dependent pathways.







Abstract
Spreading depolarization (SD) is one of the most common neuropathologic phenomena in the nervous system, relating to numerous diseases. However, real&#8208;time monitoring the rapid chemical changes during SD to probe the molecular mechanism remains a great challenge. We develop a potentiometric dual&#8208;channel microsensor for simultaneous monitoring of H2S and pH featuring excellent selectivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this microsensor we first observe real time changes of H2S and pH in the rat brain induced by SD. This changes of H2S are completely suppressed when the rat pre&#8208;treats with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a blocker to inhibit the H2S&#8208;producing enzyme, indicating H2S fluctuation might be related to enzyme&#8208;dependent pathway during SD and less pH&#8208;dependent. This study provides a new perspective for studying the function of H2S and the molecular basis of SD&#8208;associated diseases.

Our work provides the direct experimental evidence that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release during SD in rat cortex is less pH-dependent, possibly by modulating enzyme-dependent pathways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreading depolarization (SD) is one of the most common neuropathologic phenomena in the nervous system, relating to numerous diseases. However, real-time monitoring the rapid chemical changes during SD to probe the molecular mechanism remains a great challenge. We develop a potentiometric dual-channel microsensor for simultaneous monitoring of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and pH featuring excellent selectivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Using this microsensor we first observe real time changes of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and pH in the rat brain induced by SD. This changes of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S are completely suppressed when the rat pre-treats with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a blocker to inhibit the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-producing enzyme, indicating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S fluctuation might be related to enzyme-dependent pathway during SD and less pH-dependent. This study provides a new perspective for studying the function of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and the molecular basis of SD-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dopants Induce Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Triarylamine Boronate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purely organic luminescent material TBBU does not show room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state even under N2. When doped with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% DTBU, a persistent yellowish green afterglow can be observed from this binary system in N2 atmosphere. This induced phosphorescence is quite sensitive to oxygen, making the material a candidate for oxygen sensing.







Abstract
Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising candidates for oxygen sensors and information encryption owing to their cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly nature. Herein, we report a bimolecular RTP system where DTBU acts as the guest and TBBU serves as the host. In contrast to previously reported results, we find that both pure DTBU and TBBU do not exhibit RTP in the solid state even under N2 atmosphere. A DTBU/TBBU system with a low doping ratio (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) exhibits persistent yellowish&#8208;green afterglow with a lifetime of 340&#8197;ms and is highly sensitive to oxygen. A DTBU/TBBU system with a higher doping ratio (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) maintains a phosphorescence lifetime of 179&#8197;ms under air. Applications of DTBU/TBBU at varied doping ratios in both oxygen sensing and information encryption are demonstrated. We propose that the T1 state of TBBU acts as an energy transfer intermediate between Tn and T1 of DTBU, ultimately leading to the generation of persistent RTP. Overall, this work demonstrates the critical importance of material purity in the design of RTP systems, and how an understanding of host&#8211;guest doping enables their photophysical properties to be precisely tuned.

         <title>Direct, Stereodivergent, and Catalytic Michael Additions of Thioimides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes &#8211; Total Synthesis of Tapentadol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct, triisopropy silyl triflate (TIPSOTf)&#8208;mediated, regioselective and stereodivergent Michael additions of thioimides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel complexes give any of the potential syn and anti diastereomers, at will, with good to high yields. The resultant adducts can be easily transformed into a wide array of enantiomerically pure intermediates ready to participate in the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Direct and stereodivergent Michael additions of N&#8208;acyl 1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes are reported. The reactions proceed with a remarkable regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, so access to any of the four potential Michael stereoisomers is granted through the appropriate choice of the chiral ligand of the nickel(II) complex. Simple removal of the heterocyclic scaffold furnishes a wide array of either syn or anti enantiomerically pure derivatives, which can be exploited for the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds, as demonstrated in a new approach to tapentadol. In turn, a mechanism, based on theoretical calculations, is proposed to account for the stereochemical outcome of these transformations.

         <title>A New Life For Nitrile&#8208;Butadiene Rubber: Co&#8208;Harnessing Metathesis And Condensation For Reincorporation Into Bio&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key polymer material, nitrile&#8208;butadiene rubber (NBR), is converted under mild conditions via a one&#8208;pot catalytic sequence to bio&#8208;based polyesters with highly modulable structure and properties. The overall process operates with high atom&#8208;economy, formally redistributing the NBR monomers into new difunctional monomers as well as a single valuable small molecule by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Efficient plastic recycling processes are crucial for the production of value&#8208;added products or intermediates. Here, we present a multicatalytic route that allows the degradation of nitrile&#8208;butadiene rubber, cross&#8208;metathesis of the formed oligomers, and polymerization of the resulting dicarboxylic acids with bio&#8208;based diols, providing direct access to unsaturated polyesters. This one&#8208;pot approach combines the use of commercially available catalysts that are active and selective under mild conditions to synthesize renewable copolymers without the need to isolate intermediates.

         <title>Molecular Crystals Constructed by Polar Molecular Cages: A Promising System for Exploring High&#8208;performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular crystals with polar molecular cages were firstly proposed as a promising system for exploring superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, the binary chalcogenide family P4Sn (n=3&#8211;9), is introduced. As a member of the system, &#945;&#8208;P4S5 possesses a robust SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), a broad band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), ample birefringence (0.134@2050 nm), a wide optical transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m), and exceptional water&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
Polar molecular crystals, with their densely stacked polar nonlinear optical (NLO) active units, are favored for their large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses and birefringence. However, their potential for practical applications as Infrared (IR) NLO materials has historically been underappreciated due to the weak inter&#8208;molecular interaction forces that may compromise their physicochemical properties. In this study, we propose molecular crystals with polar molecular cages as a treasure&#8208;house for the development of superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, binary chalcogenide molecular crystals, composed of [P4Sn] (n=3&#8211;9) polar molecular cages, is introduced. These crystals may not only achieve wide band gap, large SHG response, and birefringence in a single structure, but also exhibit favorable physicochemical properties. We subsequently obtained a polar molecular crystal, &#945;&#8208;P4S5, which demonstrated exceptional IR optical properties, including a strong SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), wide band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), large birefringence (0.134@2050&#8197;nm), and a broad transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m). Moreover, it showed excellent water resistance and hardness. These findings highlight the potential of polar molecular crystals as a promising platform for the development of high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

         <title>Dual Stimuli&#8208;Responsive [2]Rotaxanes with Tunable Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission and Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

The dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of novel [2]rotaxanes endows them with both tunable vibration&#8208;induced emission and switchable circularly polarized luminescence, providing a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent system with precisely tunable emissions, the typical 9,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,14&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a, c]phenazine (DPAC) luminogen with attractive vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) behavior has been introduced into [2]rotaxane as a stopper. Taking advantage of their unique dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness towards solvent and anion, the resultant [2]rotaxanes reveal both tunable VIE and switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Attributed to the formation of mechanical bonds, DPAC&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxanes display interesting VIE behaviors including white&#8208;light emission upon the addition of viscous solvent, as evaluated in detail by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra. In addition, ascribed to the regulation of chirality information transmission through anion&#8208;induced motions of chiral wheel, the resolved chiral [2]rotaxanes reveal unique switchable CPL upon the addition of anion, leading to significant increase in the dissymmetry factors (glum) values with excellent reversibility. Interestingly, upon doping the chiral [2]rotaxanes in stretchable polymer, the blend films reveal remarkable emission change from white light to light blue with significant 6.5&#8208;fold increase in glum values up to &#8722;0.035 under external tensile stresses. This work provides not only a new design strategy for developing molecular systems with fluorescent tunability but also a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.

         <title>Dynamically Modulating the Dissymmetry Factor of Circularly Polarized Organic Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Soft Helical Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an effective strategy for achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high dissymmetry factor based on a bilayered soft helical superstructure doped with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and room&#8208;temperature polymer layer. This enables the significant modulation of reflection across a wide spectral range and the dynamic controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP from 1.38 to 0.60.







Abstract
Achieving circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) with a high luminescent dissymmetry factor (glum) is crucial for diverse optoelectronic applications. In particular, dynamically controlling the dissymmetry factor of CP&#8208;OURTP can profoundly advance these applications, but it is still unprecedented. This study introduces an effective strategy to achieve photoirradiation&#8208;driven chirality regulation in a bilayered structure film, which consists of a layer of soft helical superstructure incorporated with a light&#8208;driven molecular motor and a layer of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer. The prepared bilayered film exhibits CP&#8208;OURTP with an emission lifetime of 805&#8197;ms and a glum value up to 1.38. Remarkably, the glum value of the resulting CP&#8208;OURTP film can be reversibly controlled between 0.6 and 1.38 over 20&#8197;cycles by light irradiation, representing the first example of dynamically controlling the glum in CP&#8208;OURTP.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Functional Small Molecules into Nanoparticles: Assembly and Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly approach is presented whereby a library of functional small molecules, encompassing anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores, are assembled into functional metal&#8211;phenolic network nanoparticles (FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under ambient conditions. These FSM&#8208;MPN NPs have potential use in a range of biological applications.







Abstract
Small molecules, including therapeutic drugs and tracer molecules, play a vital role in biological processing, disease treatment and diagnosis, and have inspired various nanobiotechnology approaches to realize their biological function, particularly in drug delivery. Desirable features of a delivery system for functional small molecules (FSMs) include high biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and simple manufacturing processes, without the need for chemical modification of the FSM itself. Herein, we report a simple and versatile approach, based on metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly, for assembling FSMs into nanoparticles (i.e., FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under aqueous and ambient conditions. We demonstrate loading of anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores at up to ~80&#8201;% that is mostly facilitated by &#960; and hydrophobic interactions between the FSM and nanoparticle components. Secondary nanoparticle engineering involving coating with a polyphenol&#8211;antibody thin film or sequential co&#8208;loading of multiple FSMs enables cancer cell targeting and combination delivery, respectively. Incorporating fluorophores into FSM&#8208;MPN NPs enables the visualization of biodistribution at different time points, revealing that most of these NPs are retained in the kidney and heart 24&#8197;h post intravenous administration. This work provides a viable pathway for the rational design of small molecule nanoparticle delivery platforms for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Radical Cation Salts of Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls: Polar Crystals, Negative Thermal Expansion and Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocrystallization of hetera&#8208;buckybowl trichalcogenasumanenes (TCSs) has afforded radical cation salts with excellent stability under ambient conditions. The resulting salts are mostly polar crystals, where the TCSs are partially charged and form columnar stacks. A reversible semiconductor&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor phase transition is observed, which is caused by a negative thermal expansion of the unit cell.







Abstract
Radical cation salts of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles are rich in physical properties. Herein, two kinds of hetera&#8208;buckybowls, ethoxy&#8208;substituted trithiasumanene (3SEt) and triselenasumanene (3SeEt), are synthesized as electron donors. Galvanostatic oxidation of them affords radical cation salts (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SeEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SEt)4PMA, and (3SeEt)4PMA, where PMA is Keggin&#8208;type phosphomolybdate and TTFMPB is tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenyl]borate. In these salts, 3SEt/3SeEt are partially charged and show distinct conformation change with the site charge and counter anions. In TTFMPB salts, (TTFMPB)&#8722; forms hexagonal channels that accommodate the packing columns of 3SEt/3SeEt. In particular, (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3 adopts the R3c space group and is a polar crystal with the columns of 3SEt all in the up&#8208;bowl direction. The PMA salts of 3SEt/3SeEt are polar crystals (C2 space group) with 3SEt/3SeEt being planar and forming columnar stacks. (3SeEt)4PMA shows a structural modulation below 200&#8197;K, namely, negative thermal expansion (NTE) of the unit cell volume and enlargement of the intermolecular distances between neighboring 3SeEt molecules. The four salts are semiconductors with an activation energy of 0.18&#8211;0.38&#8197;eV. The conductivity of (3SeEt)4PMA shows a reversible transition upon cooling and heating, in accordance to the NTE structural modulation. This work paves the way toward conducting materials based on hetera&#8208;buckybowls.

         <title>Artificial LiF&#8208;Rich Interface Enabled by In situ Electrochemical Fluorination for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

An artificial LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface formed by a fluorinated carbon nanotube macrofilm endows stable Li&#8208;metal batteries with long lifetimes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. One drawback of uncontrollable electrolyte degradation is the ability to form a fragile and nonuniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI). In this study, we propose the use of a fluorinated carbon nanotube (CNT) macrofilm (CMF) on Li metal as a hybrid anode, which can regulate the redox state at the anode/electrolyte interface. Due to the favorable reaction energy between the plated Li and fluorinated CNTs, the metal can be fluorinated directly to a LiF&#8208;rich SEI during the charging process, leading to a high Young's modulus (~2.0&#8197;GPa) and fast ionic transfer (~2.59&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The obtained SEI can guide the homogeneous plating/stripping of Li during electrochemical processes while suppressing dendrite growth. In particular, the hybrid of endowed full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability allows for high capacity retention (~99.3&#8201;%) and remarkable rate capacity. This work can extend fluorination technology into a platform to control artificial SEI formation in Li&#8208;metal batteries, increasing the stability and long&#8208;term performance of the resulting material.

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Loss of Fast Charging Capability in Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon extended cycling, the presence of microcracks and resulting internal degradation lead to the hindered kinetics during the (de)intercalation of Li+ ions. While these issues were not problematic during charging at low currents, fast charging conditions induce electrochemically unreactive regions in the cathodes owing to increased resistance and polarization, which lead to the loss of fast charging.







Abstract
Fast charging technology for electric vehicles (EVs), offering rapid charging times similar to conventional vehicle refueling, holds promise but faces obstacles owing to kinetic issues within lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Specifically, the significance of cathode materials in fast charging has grown because Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are employed to enhance the energy density of LIBs. Herein, the mechanism behind the loss of fast charging capability of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during extended cycling is investigated through a comparative analysis of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with different microstructures. The results revealed that microcracks and the resultant cathode deterioration significantly compromised the fast charging capability over extended cycling. When thick rocksalt impurity phases form throughout the particles owing to electrolyte infiltration via microcracks, the limited kinetics of Li+ ions create electrochemically unreactive areas under high&#8208;current conditions, resulting in the loss of fast charging capability. Hence, preventing microcrack formation by tailoring microstructures is essential to ensure stability in fast charging capability. Understanding the relationship between microcracks and the loss of fast charging capability is essential for developing Ni&#8208;rich cathodes that facilitate stable fast charging upon extended cycling, thereby promoting widespread EV adoption.

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Hierarchical Porous &#960;&#8208;stacked Supermolecular Spring Frameworks from Aromatic Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>

Hierarchical porous aromatic chiral cage&#8208;based &#960;OF with spring&#8208;like structure presents outstanding elasticity and reversible pressure&#8208;dependent emission with high&#8208;contrast emission difference over a wide pressure range.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials that exhibit pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence variations are attracting interest with wide potential applications in mechanical sensors, anticounterfeiting and storage devices. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied in piezochromism for highly tunable luminescence. Nevertheless, reversible and high&#8208;contrast emission response with a wide pressure range is still challenging. Herein, the first example of hierarchical porous cage&#8208;based &#960;OF (Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1) with spring structure was synthesized by using aromatic chiral cages as building blocks. Its elastic properties evaluated based on the bulk modulus (9.5&#8197;GPa) is softer than most reported CPMs and the collapse point (20.0&#8197;GPa) significantly exceeds ever reported CPMs. As smart materials, Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1 displays linear pressure&#8208;dependent emission and achieves a high&#8208;contrast emission difference up to 154&#8197;nm. Pressure&#8208;responsive limit is up to 16&#8197;GPa, outperforming the CPMs reported so far. Dedicated experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8208;dominated controllable structural shrinkage and porous&#8208;spring&#8208;structure&#8208;mediated elasticity is responsible for the outstanding piezofluorochromism.

         <title>1D Covalent Organic Frameworks Triggering Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of H2O2 via Controllable Modular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of novel VIA group elements (O, S, Se)&#8208;bridged 1D COFs with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology were synthesized and applied as catalysts in the photosynthesis of H2O2. Thanks to their 1D configurations, more active sites are accessible, the proton interlaminar shuttle are accelerated, and the directional transfer of electrons is also improved. The bridge&#8208;atoms (O, S, Se) in the 1D COFs play a crucial role for the catalytic activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The topological diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables considerable space for exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this study, we report a sequence of novel 1D COFs (EO, ES, and ESe&#8208;COF) with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology that can be interconnected with VIA group elements (O, S, and Se) via a modular design strategy. It is found that the electronic structures, charge delivery property, light harvesting ability, and hydrophilicity of these 1D COFs can be profoundly influenced by the bridge&#8208;linked atom ordinal. Finally, EO&#8208;COF, possessing the highest quantity of active sites, the longest lifetime of the active electron, the strongest interaction with O2, and the lowest energy barrier of O2 reduction, exhibits exceptional photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 activity under visible light, with a production rate of 2675&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high apparent quantum yield of 6.57&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. This is the first systematic report on 1D COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis, which enriches the topological database in reticular chemistry and promotes the exploration of structure&#8208;catalysis correlation.

         <title>Deciphering Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Towards CO2 Electroreduction over SnO2 by A Standard Research Paradigm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard research paradigm proposed to uncover the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over SnO2, illustrating the surface reconstruction induced by oxygen vacancies (1/1&#8197;ML coverage) and surface&#8208;active species (Sn layer) accountable for selective HCOOH production. This proposed methodology validated by the experimental CO2RR is appliable to other electrocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Authentic surface structures under reaction conditions determine the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, therefore, the knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship can facilitate the design of efficient catalyst structures for specific reactivity requirements. However, understanding the relationship between a more realistic active surface and its performance is challenging due to the complicated interface microenvironment in electrocatalysis. Herein, we proposed a standard research paradigm to effectively decipher the structure&#8208;activity relationship in electrocatalysis, which is exemplified in the CO2 electroreduction over SnO2. The proposed practice has aided in discovering authentic/resting surface states (Sn layer) of SnO2 accountable for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance under electrocatalytic conditions, which then is corroborated in the subsequent CO2RR experiments over SnO2 with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoparticles, and nanosheets) in combination with in situ characterizations. This proposed methodology is further extended to the SnO electrocatalysts, providing helpful insights into catalytic structures.

     alt="Deciphering Structure-Activity Relationship Towards CO2 Electroreduction over SnO2 by A Standard Research Paradigm"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard research paradigm proposed to uncover the structure-property-activity relationships for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) over SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, illustrating the surface reconstruction induced by oxygen vacancies (1/1&#8197;ML coverage) and surface-active species (Sn layer) accountable for selective HCOOH production. This proposed methodology validated by the experimental CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR is appliable to other electrocatalytic systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentic surface structures under reaction conditions determine the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, therefore, the knowledge of the structure-activity relationship can facilitate the design of efficient catalyst structures for specific reactivity requirements. However, understanding the relationship between a more realistic active surface and its performance is challenging due to the complicated interface microenvironment in electrocatalysis. Herein, we proposed a standard research paradigm to effectively decipher the structure-activity relationship in electrocatalysis, which is exemplified in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction over SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The proposed practice has aided in discovering authentic/resting surface states (Sn layer) of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accountable for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) performance under electrocatalytic conditions, which then is corroborated in the subsequent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR experiments over SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoparticles, and nanosheets) in combination with in situ characterizations. This proposed methodology is further extended to the SnO electrocatalysts, providing helpful insights into catalytic structures. It is believed that our proposed standard research paradigm is also applicable to other electrocatalytic systems, in the meantime, decreases the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and accelerates the design of catalyst structures that achieve sustainable performance for energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Specific Dual Modification of Peptides through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of peptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, affording the chemically robust pyrrolidine ring in excellent yields with complete exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific introduction of multiple components into peptides is greatly needed for the preparation of densely functionalized and structurally uniform peptides. In this regard, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific peptide modification is attractive, but it can be difficult due to the presence of highly nucleophilic lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine. In this work, we developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of iminopeptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, thus affording the cycloadducts in excellent yields. Tolerating a broad range of functional groups and molecules, the present method provides the opportunity to rapidly construct doubly functionalized peptides using readily accessible aldehyde and maleimide modules.

         <title>Tailoring Na+ Solvation Environment and Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases with Sn(OTf)2 Additive in Non&#8208;flammable Phosphate Electrolytes towards Safe and Efficient Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2), is proposed to engineer a non&#8208;flammable triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based electrolyte, aiming to regulate the solvation environment of Na+, facilitate uniform Na deposition, and suppress the shuttling of sodium polysulfides for safe and efficient room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are promising for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, these batteries are plagued by safety concerns due to the highly flammable nature of conventional electrolytes. Although non&#8208;flammable electrolytes eliminate the risk of fire, they often result in compromised battery performance due to poor compatibility with sodium metal anode and sulfur cathode. Herein, we develop an additive of tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2) in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes to improve the cycling stability of RT Na&#8208;S batteries via modulating the Na+ solvation environment and interface chemistry. The additive reduces the Na+ desolvation energy and enhances the electrolyte stability. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of Na&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). These interphases help to suppress the growth of Na dendrites and the dissolution/shuttling of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), resulting in improved reversible capacity. Specifically, the Na&#8208;S battery with the designed electrolyte boosts the capacity from 322 to 906&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides valuable insights for the development of safe and high&#8208;performance electrolytes in RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>A Programmable DNAzyme for the Sensitive Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unimolecular self&#8208;locked allosteric DNAzyme biosensor (named SPOT) is developed to enable sensitive detection (LOD: fM&#8208;aM) of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids in a one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step, preamplification&#8208;free, isothermal detection manner. SPOT exhibits potent performance on miRNA&#8208;based detection for cancer diagnostics and viral RNA&#8208;based detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection diagnostics.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop&#8208;initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one&#8208;stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost&#8208;effective detection of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.

         <title>2D Metal/Graphene and 2D Metal/Graphene/Metal Systems for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong covalent bonding between metal monolayer and graphene driven by the sp and d orbital hybridization, 2D metal/graphene (M/G) system is investigated. The charge transfer from metal to graphene allows for the electrodeposition of another metal film, thus forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) system. These 2D hybrid systems exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward formic acid production over competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Efficiently transforming CO2 into renewable energy sources is crucial for decarbonization efforts. Formic acid (HCOOH) holds great promise as a hydrogen storage compound due to its high hydrogen density, non&#8208;toxicity, and stability under ambient conditions. However, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) on conventional carbon black&#8208;supported metal catalysts faces challenges such as low stability through dissolution and agglomeration, as well as suffering from high overpotentials and the necessity to overcome the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we modify the physical/chemical properties of metal surfaces by depositing metal monolayers on graphene (M/G) to create highly active and stable electrocatalysts. Strong covalent bonding between graphene and metal is induced by the hybridization of sp and d orbitals, especially the sharp 
, 
, and 
 orbitals of metals near the Fermi level, playing a decisive role. Moreover, charge polarization on graphene in M/G enables the deposition of another thin metallic film, forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) structures. Finally, evaluating overpotentials required for CO2 reduction to HCOOH, CO, and HER, we find that Pd/G, Pt/G/Ag, and Pt/G/Au exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward HCOOH production. Our novel 2D hybrid catalyst design methodology may offer insights into enhanced electrochemical reactions through the electronic mixing of metal and other p&#8208;block elements.

Finally, evaluating overpotentials required for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to HCOOH, CO, and HER, we find that Pd/G, Pt/G/Ag, and Pt/G/Au exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward HCOOH production. Our novel 2D hybrid catalyst design methodology may offer insights into enhanced electrochemical reactions through the electronic mixing of metal and other p-block elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substantial Impact of Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Electrode Potential on the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Ru&#8722;CoP Urchin Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) resulted in a strong asymmetrical charge distribution on the Ru cluster, which accelerated water dissociation. However, strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low potentials. As the potential became more negative, the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had a near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus accelerating the entire alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process.







Abstract
Although great efforts on the delicate construction of a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) to modify the electronic properties of active sites have been conducted, the substantial impact of BIEF coupled with electrode potential on the electrochemical reactions has not been clearly investigated. Herein, we designed an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of heterogeneous Ru&#8722;CoP urchin arrays on carbon cloth (Ru&#8722;CoP/CC) with a strong BIEF with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, despite its unsatisfactory activity at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (overpotential of 44&#8197;mV), Ru&#8722;CoP/CC exhibited better activity (357&#8197;mV) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (505&#8197;mV) at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low current densities. However, as the electrode potential became more negative (i.e., the current density increased), the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus greatly accelerating the whole alkaline HER process. This explains why the activity of Ru&#8722;CoP is relatively susceptible to the electrode potential compared to Pt/C.

         <title>Orthogonal Postsynthetic Copolymerization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks into a PolyHOF Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PolyHOF membrane, constructed via covalently copolymerizing nanoscale HOFs into polymeric network, not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties, but also shows excellent functional compatibility, proven by the benchmark luminescent temperature sensing behavior of lanthanide anchored polyHOF membrane even under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown promise in various fields; however, the construction of HOF/polymer hybrid membranes that can maintain both structural and functional integrity remains challenging. In this study, we here fabricated a new HOF (HOF&#8208;50) with reserved polymerizable allyl group via charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds between the carboxylate anion and amidinium, and subsequently copolymerized the HOF with monomers to construct a covalently bonded HOF/polymer hybrid (polyHOF) membrane. The resulting polyHOF membrane not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties and extreme stability, but also shows an exceptional ratiometric luminescent temperature&#8208;sensing function with very high sensitivity and visibility even when the lanthanide content is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported mixed&#8208;lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This orthogonal postsynthesis copolymerization strategy may provide a general approach for preparing covalently connected HOF/polymer hybrid membranes for diverse applications.

Solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes are applied in metal&#8208;air batteries, introducing dual&#8208;air batteries for intrinsic safe energy storage. In their Research Article (e202318369), Xiaodong Chen and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that fire&#8208;tolerant batteries are achieved, and reveal that the highest tolerance temperature of electrolytes is determined by solute intramolecular bonds instead of solvent intermolecular interactions, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes for their thermal stability.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solute-in-air electrolytes&lt;/b&gt; are applied in metal-air batteries, introducing dual-air batteries for intrinsic safe energy storage. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202318369"&gt;e202318369&lt;/a&gt;), Xiaodong Chen and co-workers demonstrate that fire-tolerant batteries are achieved, and reveal that the highest tolerance temperature of electrolytes is determined by solute intramolecular bonds instead of solvent intermolecular interactions, inspiring a concept of non-van der Waals electrolytes for their thermal stability.

         <title>Back Cover: Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and EmissionRecovery through Supramolecular Recoupling (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 12/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the sunlight (oil phase), the Morning Stars (the Ag29 nanoclusters) shine brightly, but when night falls (aqueous phase transfer), the stars may lose their luster (photoluminescence quenching). Yet, there are always some special stars. When they come together (supramolecular recoupling), they become the shining Big Dipper (emission recovery) for guiding the direction (downstream hydrophilic applications). Details of the research are reported by Xi Kang, Wenxiong Shi, Manzhou Zhu et&#8197;al. (e202317995).

         <title>Empowering Site&#8208;Specific Bioconjugations In Vitro and In Vivo: Advances in Sortase Engineering and Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is extensively employed in site&#8208;specific bioconjugations. This review presents an overview of recent advancements in sortase engineering and the resulting innovative in vitro and in vivo SML applications. Moreover, we explore the potential future impact of integrating SML with cutting&#8208;edge techniques, such as click chemistry, unnatural amino acid incorporation, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, for interdisciplinary research.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) has emerged as a powerful and versatile methodology for site&#8208;specific protein conjugation, functionalization/labeling, immobilization, and design of biohybrid molecules and systems. However, the broader application of SML faces several challenges, such as limited activity and stability, dependence on calcium ions, and reversible reactions caused by nucleophilic side&#8208;products. Over the past decade, protein engineering campaigns and particularly directed evolution, have been extensively employed to overcome sortase limitations, thereby expanding the potential application of SML in multiple directions, including therapeutics, biorthogonal chemistry, biomaterials, and biosensors. This review provides an overview of achieved advancements in sortase engineering and highlights recent progress in utilizing SML in combination with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical and biological methodologies. The aim is to encourage scientists to employ sortases in their conjugation experiments.

Phosphine&#8208;functionalized MOFs (P&#8208;MOFs) offer novel opportunities in heterogeneous catalysis. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the reported P&#8208;MOFs. In particular, we remark the current obstacles and possible solutions, including new reaction types and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities behind challenges.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (P&#8208;MOFs) as an emerging class of coordination polymers, have provided novel opportunities for the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Yet, compared with the ubiquitous phosphine systems in homogeneous catalysis, heterogenization of phosphines in MOFs is still at its early stage. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the P&#8208;MOFs reported in literature. In particular, various catalytic reactions are discussed in detail in terms of phosphine ligand structure&#8208;function relationship, including the potential obstacles for future development. Finally, we discuss the possible solutions, including new types of reactions and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities and challenges.

This Minireview summarizes developments in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles, synthesized by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The high production efficiency of PISA coupled with degradability provides the next generation of particulate materials that can better serve the need for sustainability.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) combines polymerization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers in one system and has become a widely used method to prepare block copolymer nanoparticles at high concentrations. The persistence of polymers in the environment poses a huge threat to the ecosystem and represents a significant waste of resources. There is an urgent need to develop novel chemical approaches to synthesize degradable polymers. To meet with this demand, it is crucial to install degradability into PISA nanoparticles. Most recently, degradable PISA nanoparticles have been synthesized by introducing degradation mechanisms into either shell&#8208;forming or core&#8208;forming blocks. This Minireview summarizes the development in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles synthesized by PISA, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable, and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles. Future development will benefit from expansion of polymerization techniques with new degradation mechanisms and adaptation of high&#8208;throughput approaches for both PISA syntheses and degradation studies.

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Understanding London Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has by now been realized that London dispersion (LD) interactions, the main contributor to the attractive part of the van der Waals potential, are ubiquitously present and need to be taken into consideration in structures and dynamics of chemical reactions. This review highlights recent experimental and theoretical advances in utilizing LD interactions as a design element.







Abstract
London dispersion (LD) interactions are the main contribution of the attractive part of the van der Waals potential. Even though LD effects are the driving force for molecular aggregation and recognition, the role of these omnipresent interactions in structure and reactivity had been largely underappreciated over decades. However, in the recent years considerable efforts have been made to thoroughly study LD interactions and their potential as a chemical design element for structures and catalysis. This was made possible through a fruitful interplay of theory and experiment. This review highlights recent results and advances in utilizing LD interactions as a structural motif to understand and utilize intra&#8208; and intermolecularly LD&#8208;stabilized systems. Additionally, we focus on the quantification of LD interactions and their fundamental role in chemical reactions.

         <title>Designing and Engineering Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for CO2 to CO Conversion: From Single to Dual Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts are discussed from single to dual metal sites for CO2 to CO conversion. In particular, designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to break the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Challenges and solutions of CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors are highlighted for improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to achieving sustainable electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion and storage while decarbonizing the emission&#8208;heavy industry. The carbon&#8208;supported, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated, and atomically dispersed metal sites are effective catalysts for CO generation due to their high activity, selectivity, and earth abundance. Here, we discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts from single to dual metal sites. Engineering single metal sites using a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon model was highlighted to exclusively study the effect of carbon particle sizes, metal contents, and M&#8722;N bond structures in the form of MN4 moieties on catalytic activity and selectivity. The structure&#8208;property correlation was analyzed by combining experimental results with theoretical calculations to uncover the CO2 to CO conversion mechanisms. Furthermore, dual&#8208;metal site catalysts, inheriting the merits of single&#8208;metal sites, have emerged as a new frontier due to their potentially enhanced catalytic properties. Designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to alter the surface adsorption to CO2 and various intermediates, thus breaking the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors was discussed to provide insights into the electrolyzer design with improved CO2 utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.

         <title>A Straightforward Method for the Generation of Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen with a Partially Negative Line</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conditions under which orthohydrogen with a unique Partial Negative Line (PNL) can be observed were determined by one of the essential Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) hyperpolarization methods, called Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). A transient species exists during the preliminary SABRE activation processes, and is responsible for the generation of PNL.







Abstract
The hydrogen molecule, which exists in two spin isomers (ortho&#8208; and parahydrogen), is a highly studied system due to its fundamental properties and practical applications. Parahydrogen is used for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance signal enhancement, which is hyperpolarization of other molecules, including biorelevant ones. Hyperpolarization can be achieved by using Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). SABRE can also convert parahydrogen into orthohydrogen, and surprisingly, in some cases, it has been discovered that orthohydrogen's resonance has the Partially Negative Line (PNL) pattern. Here, an approach for obtaining orthohydrogen with a PNL signal is presented for two catalysts: Ir&#8722;IMes, and Ir&#8722;IMesBn. The type of solvent in which SABRE is conducted is crucial for the observation of PNL. Specifically, a PNL signal can be easily generated in benzene using both catalysts, but it is more intense for Ir&#8722;IMesBn. In acetone, PNL is observed only for Ir&#8722;IMesBn. In methanol, no PNL is detected. The PNL effect is only detectable during the initial steps of pre&#8208;catalyst activation, and disappears as the activation process progresses. We have proposed a working hypothesis that explains our results. The presented data may facilitate the further investigation of PNL and its applications in material science and catalysis.

         <title>Electrochemical Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;N Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of redox active ester and oxime esters was realized through electrochemical cathodic reduction. Mechanistic studies unveil a high&#8208;valent nickel species&#8208;driven reductive elimination pathway, rather than direct radical&#8208;radical coupling. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through a broad scope (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176; carboxylic acids) and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
A new electrochemical transformation is presented that enables chemists to couple simple alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives with an electrophilic amine reagent to construct C(sp3)&#8722;N bond. The success of this reaction hinges on the merging of cooperative electrochemical reduction with nickel catalysis. The chemistry exhibits a high degree of practicality, showcasing its wide applicability with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176; carboxylic acids and remarkable compatibility with diverse functional groups, even in the realm of late&#8208;stage functionalization. Furthermore, extensive mechanistic studies have unveiled the engagement of alkyl radicals and iminyl radicals; and elucidated the multifaceted roles played by iPr2O, Ni catalyst, and electricity.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Complex Polyenes through Sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of trans&#8208;Styrenes</title>

The &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes is presented. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization via a six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;palladacycle to afford tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization via a seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;palladacycle to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide.







Abstract
Sequential C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules containing multiple C&#8722;H bonds can efficiently lead to structural diversity. Herein we present the first chelation&#8208;assisted sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E&#8208;styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization by six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;cyclopalladation to result in tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization through seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;cyclopalladation to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes in up to 97&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99/1 E/Z selectivity, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide. The protocol is demonstrated to be widely applicable, tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and bioactive fragments, and suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as one&#8208;pot and two step preparation of trienes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the selectivity and reactivity.

         <title>Dynamic Monkey Bar Mechanism of Superionic Li&#8208;ion Transport in LiTaCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning force field molecular dynamics simulations reveal the superionic Li+ transport in glassy LiTaCl6 via the dynamic monkey bar mechanism&#8211;the high density and dynamics of the vibrating Cl&#8722; ions (the dynamic bars) allow Li ions to hold on to them while moving fast through the lattice.







Abstract
The LiTaCl6 solid electrolyte has the lowest activation energy of ionic conduction at ambient conditions (0.165&#8197;eV), with a record high ionic conductivity for a ternary compound (11&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). However, the mechanism has been unclear. We train machine&#8208;learning force fields (MLFF) on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data on&#8208;the&#8208;fly and perform MLFF MD simulations of AIMD quality up to the nanosecond scale at the experimental temperatures, which allows us to predict accurate activation energy for Li&#8208;ion diffusion (at 0.164&#8197;eV). Detailed analyses of trajectories and vibrational density of states show that the large&#8208;amplitude vibrations of Cl&#8722; ions in TaCl6&#8722; enable the fast Li&#8208;ion transport by allowing dynamic breaking and reforming of Li&#8722;Cl bonds across the space in between the TaCl6&#8722; octahedra. We term this process the dynamic&#8208;monkey&#8208;bar mechanism of superionic Li+ transport which could aid the development of new solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic and Thermocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Propionaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reaction Scheme is demonstrated to convert CO2 to propionaldehyde. By individually optimizing and efficiently coupling the upstream and downstream processes, this hybrid system achieves a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38&#8201;%, considerably higher than the best electrochemical systems alone or other hybrid systems reported earlier.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction can convert CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, but its selectivity toward C3+ products are very limited. One possible solution is to run the reactions in hybrid processes by coupling electrocatalysis with other catalytic routes. In this contribution, we report the cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 to propionaldehyde. Using Cu(OH)2 nanowires as the precatalyst, CO2/H2O is reduced to concentrated C2H4, CO, and H2 gases in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor. The thermochemical hydroformylation reaction is separately investigated with a series of rhodium&#8208;phosphine complexes. The best candidate is identified to be the one with the 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane diphosphine ligand, which exhibits a propionaldehyde turnover number of 1148 under a mild temperature and close&#8208;to&#8208;atmospheric pressure. By coupling and optimizing the upstream CO2 electroreduction and downstream hydroformylation reaction, we achieve a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38&#8201;% and a total C3 oxygenate selectivity of 44&#8201;% based on reduced CO2. These values represent a more than seven times improvement over the best prior electrochemical system alone or over two times improvement over other hybrid systems.

The facile and cost&#8208;effective hybridization strategy for proton exchange membranes (PEMs) design by blending 1&#8197;nm metal oxide clusters and polyvinyl butyral. The fuel cells equipped with the PEM show promising power densities and excellent durability that is on par with Nafion&#174; and surpass the previously reported non&#8208;fluorinated PEMs.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective, non&#8208;fluorinated polymer proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are highly desirable in emerging hydrogen fuel cells (FCs) technology; however, their low proton conductivities and poor chemical and dimension stabilities hinder their further development as alternatives to commercial Nafion&#174;. Here, we report the inorganic&#8208;organic hybridization strategy by facilely complexing commercial polymers, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), with inorganic molecular nanoparticles, H3PW12O40 (PW) via supramolecular interaction. The strong affinity among them endows the obtained nanocomposites amphiphilicity and further lead to phase separation for bi&#8208;continuous structures with both inter&#8208;connected proton transportation channels and robust polymer scaffold, enabling high proton conductivities, mechanical/dimension stability and barrier performance, and the H2/O2 FCs equipped with the composite PEM show promising power densities and long&#8208;term stability. Interestingly, the hybrid PEM can be fabricated continuously in large scale at challenging ~10&#8197;&#956;m thickness via typical tape casting technique originated from their facile complexing strategy and the hybrids&#8217; excellent mechanical properties. This work not only provides potential material systems for commercial PEMs, but also raises interest for the research on hybrid composites for PEMs.

Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded products induces a stereospecific ring&#8208;contraction that results in an overall asymmetric enantioselective one&#8208;carbon enlargement of the heterocycle.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused nitrogen heterocycles are common features of bioactive molecules, and the enantioselective synthesis of their substituted analogues is an important goal. In this paper we demonstrate a practical and mechanistically intriguing approach to the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;arylbenzazepines and their analogues. The reaction sequence starts with an asymmetric migratory ring expansion of indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, or tetrahydrobenzazepine ureas on treatment with a chiral lithium amide base. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded ureas with acid triggers a two&#8208;atom ring contraction&#8212;an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; in which one urea nitrogen displaces the other&#8212;with almost complete retention of stereochemistry. Aminolysis of the urea products provides enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives and their congeners, including an analogue of an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug solifenacin. Deuteration, in situ IR, and DFT studies provide evidence for the mechanisms of the reaction steps.

         <title>Converting Glycerol into Valuable Trioses by Cu&#948;+&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated WO3 under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst has achieved a high conversion rate and excellent selectivity in the process of visible light&#8208;driven oxidation of glycerol to trioses. The critical role of single Cu atoms is to attract photogenerated holes, thereby improving charge transfer and activating glycerol molecules.







Abstract
Photocatalytic selective oxidation under visible light presents a promising approach for the sustainable transformation of biomass&#8208;derived wastes. However, achieving both high conversion and excellent selectivity poses a significant challenge. In this study, two valuable trioses, glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, are produced from glycerol over Cu&#948;+&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst in the presence of H2O2. The photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable five&#8208;fold increase in the conversion rate (3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) while maintaining a high selectivity towards two trioses (46.4&#8201;% to glyceraldehyde and 32.9&#8201;% to dihydroxyacetone). Through a comprehensive analysis involving X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements with and without light irradiation, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and isotopic analysis, the critical role of Cu+ species has been explored as efficient hole acceptors. These species facilitate charge transfer, promoting glycerol oxidation by photoholes, followed by coupling with OH&#8208;, which are subsequently dehydrated to yield the desired glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone.

         <title>Integrated Anionic Zirconium&#8208;Organic Cage and Cationic Boron&#8208;Imidazolate Cage for Synergetic Optical Limiting</title>

Making anionic zirconium&#8208;organic cage and cationic boron&#8208;imidazolate cage into a tightly ordered structure achieves an efficient optical limiting response.







Abstract
Making oppositely charged metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) into a tightly ordered structure may bring interesting functions. Herein, we report a novel structure composed of anionic (Zr4L6)8&#8722; (L=embonate) tetrahedral cages and in situ&#8208;formed cationic [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ (Bim=[BH(im)3]&#8722;; im=imidazole) cubic cages. Chiral transfer is observed from enantiopure (Zr4L6)8&#8722; cage to enantiopure [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ cage. A pair of enantiomers (PTC&#8208;373(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;373(&#923;)) are formed. PTC&#8208;373 exhibits high chemical and thermal stabilities, affording an interesting single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. More importantly, the combination of ionic pair cages significantly enhances its third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property, and its thin&#8208;film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalysis: Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde Oxidation without Sacrifical Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that a two&#8208;hole oxidation process such as TEMPO catalyzed alcohol oxidation is a viable reaction to couple with reduction reaction to eliminate SED and generate two added&#8208;value chemicals in dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
There is a growing interest in developing dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) to produce molecular hydrogen (H2) as alternative energy source. To improve the sustainability of this technology, we replaced the sacrificial electron donor (SED), typically an expensive and polluting chemical, with an alcohol oxidation catalyst. This study demonstrates the first
dye&#8208;sensitized system using a diketopyrrolopyrrole dye covalently linked to 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) based catalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde transformation operating in water with visible irradiation.

         <title>Reversible Thiyl Radical Addition&#8722;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy has been developed, which could directly control the thiyl radical chain polymerizations to afford polymers with a controlled molecular weight and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Developing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods that could directly control the thiyl radical propagation is highly desirable yet remains challenging in modern polymer chemistry. Here, we reported the first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy, which utilizes allyl sulfides as chain transfer agents for reversibly deactivating the propagating thiyl radicals, thus allowing us to directly control a challenging thiyl radical chain polymerization to afford polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures. A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, high chain&#8208;end fidelity, and efficient chain extension proved good controllability of the polymerization. In addition, density functional theory calculations provided insight into the reversible deactivation ability of allyl sulfides. The SRAFT strategy developed in this work represents a promising platform for discovering new controlled polymerizations based on thiyl radical chemistry.

         <title>Amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane&#8208;Enabled Electrophilic Amination of Arylboronic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes enable the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, including one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines.







Abstract
In this report, we describe the use of amino&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes in the electrophilic amination of arylboronic acids and boronates. Iodine(III) reagents with transferable amino groups, including one with an NH2 group, were synthesized and used in the amination, allowing the synthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary (hetero)arylamines. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations indicate that the reaction proceeds through an electrophilic amination process from a tetravalent borate complex with a B&#8722;N dative bond.

         <title>Peptide and Enzyme Catalysts Work in Concert in Stereoselective Cascade Reactions&#8212;Oxidation followed by Conjugate Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme and a peptide catalyze&#8212;in an aqueous buffer&#8212;a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity in one pot. The optimization of the modular peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions were key for bringing the two worlds of enzyme and peptide catalysis together.







Abstract
Enzymes and peptide catalysts consist of the same building blocks but require vastly different environments to operate best. Herein, we show that an enzyme and a peptide catalyst can work together in a single reaction vessel to catalyze a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Abundant linear alcohols, nitroolefins, an alcohol oxidase, and a tripeptide catalyst provided chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes in aqueous buffer. High yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and stereoselectivities (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were achieved for the cascade through the rational design of the peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Ru Nanoparticles with Parasitic Ru&#8208;Co Dual&#8208;Single Atoms Overcome the Volmer Step of Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry of ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles is compromised by embedding Co single atoms, leading to the release of Ru single atoms and the formation of a Co1Ru1,n/rGO structure, which regulates the interaction between active sites and enhances the hydrogen oxidation reaction kinetics, mass activity and excellent durability.







Abstract
Efficient dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and the facile dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra&#8208;small ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles by embedding cobalt (Co) single atoms, which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen&#8208;affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom within Ru nanoparticles. The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H2O. As anticipated, Co1Ru1,n/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1) at 50&#8197;mV and exchange current density (0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts. This investigation provides valuable insights into hybrid multi&#8208;single&#8208;atom and metal nanoparticle catalysis.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Arylketone Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers has been realized. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products is showcased via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal difunctionalization of electro&#8208;rich arenes is achieved by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group.







Abstract
We report herein the development of palladium&#8208;catalyzed deacylative deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers. This protocol features excellent functional group tolerance, heterocyclic compatibility, and high deuterium incorporation levels. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products are showcased via Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal meta&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization (including fluorination, arylation, and alkylation) and para&#8208;C&#8722;H bond deuteration of electro&#8208;rich arenes are realized by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group, which is distinct from aryl halide in conventional dehalogenative deuteration.

         <title>sp3&#8208;Rich Heterocycle Synthesis on DNA: Application to DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp3)&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be assembled on DNA from readily available ketochlorohydrins through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxypyrrolidine&#8208;containing DNA encoded libraries occupy a unique region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.







Abstract
DNA encoded library (DEL) synthesis represents a convenient means to produce, annotate and store large collections of compounds in a small volume. While DELs are well suited for drug discovery campaigns, the chemistry used in their production must be compatible with the DNA tag, which can limit compound class accessibility. As a result, most DELs are heavily populated with peptidomimetic and sp2&#8208;rich molecules. Herein, we show that sp3&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be made on DNA from ketochlorohydrin aldol products through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxypyrrolidines possess structural features that are desirable for DELs and target a distinct region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.

         <title>Mining the Metabolic Capacity of Clostridium sporogenes Aided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metabolic capacity of Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 15579 against small molecules was predicted by using an in silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, followed by experimental evaluation in vivo. Bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays were further utilized to identify an enzyme EvoB3 for everolimus modification through ketoreduction.







Abstract
Anaerobes dominate the microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where a significant portion of small molecules can be degraded or modified. However, the enormous metabolic capacity of gut anaerobes remains largely elusive in contrast to aerobic bacteria, mainly due to the requirement of sophisticated laboratory settings. In this study, we employed an in silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, to predict the metabolic capacity of a gut anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes, against small molecules. Experiments revealed that among the top seven candidates predicted as unstable, six indeed exhibited instability in C. sporogenes culture. We further identified several metabolites resulting from the supplementation of everolimus in the bacterial culture for the first time. By utilizing bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays, we successfully identified an enzyme encoded in the genome of C. sporogenes responsible for everolimus transformation. Our framework thus can potentially facilitate future understanding of small molecules metabolism in the gut, further improve patient care through personalized medicine, and guide the development of new small molecule drugs and therapeutic approaches.

         <title>Chiral CpxRhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Aziridination of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 12, March 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) catalyzed highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and N&#8208;pivalolyloxy sulfonamides has been developed. This catalytic system demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity and broad functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yields, 93% ee).







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) CpxRh(III) catalysis has been demonstrated to be competent for catalyzing highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and nitrene sources. The chiral CpxRh(III) catalysis system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance and wide functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 93&#8201;% ee). This protocol presents a novel and effective strategy for synthesizing enantioenriched aziridines from simple alkenes. Various transformations were performed on the aziridine products, illustrating the versatility and synthetic potential of this protocol for constructing highly functionalized compounds.

         <dc:description>Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates. Of these material classes, polymethacrylates also possess the unique possibility to undergo a photocatalytic depolymerization back to monomer under thermodynamically favourable conditions, thus presenting significant advantages over traditional thermal strategies. Our perspective on current formidable challenges and potential future directions are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2&#160;Activation and Valorization on Metallic Copper and Carbon&#8208;Embedded N&#8208;Coordinated Single Metal MNC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2&#8208;containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure&#8208;activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR.
Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex&#8208;situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today&#8217;s disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2&#160;electrolyzers over longer times, at larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamental structural and electronic understanding of palladium catalysts on nitride and oxide supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nature of the support can fundamentally affect the function of a heterogeneous catalyst. For the novel type of isolated metal atom catalysts, sometimes referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts, systematic correlations are still rare. Here, we report a general finding that Pd on nitride supports (non&#8208;metal and metal nitride) always features a higher oxidation state compared to that on oxide supports (non&#8208;metal and metal oxide). Through thorough oxidation state investigations by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO&#8208;DRIFTS, and density functional theory (DFT) coupled with Bader charge analysis, it is found that Pd atoms prefer to interact with surface hydroxyl group to form a Pd(OH)x species on oxide supports, while on nitride supports, Pd atoms incorporate into the surface structure in the form of Pd&#8722;N bonds. Moreover, a correlation was built between the formal oxidation state and the computational Bader charge, based on the periodic trend in electronegativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Programmed Biosynthesis of Heterotrimeric Fungal Depside Thielavin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thielavin A (1) is a fungal depside composed of one 3&#8208;methylorsellinic acid and two 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid units. It displays diverse biological activities. However, the mechanism underlying the assembly of the heterotrimeric structure of 1 remains to be clarified. In this study, we identified the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of 1. This PKS, designated as ThiA, possesses an unusual domain organization with the C&#8208;methyltransferase (MT) domain situated at the C&#8208;terminus following the thioesterase (TE) domain. Our findings indicated that the TE domain is solely responsible for two rounds of ester bond formation, along with subsequent chain hydrolysis. We identified a plausible mechanism for TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions and obtained insights into how a single PKS can selectively yield a specific heterotrimeric product. In particular, the tandem acyl carrier protein domains of ThiA are critical for programmed methylation by the MT domain. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence of highly optimized domain&#8211;domain communication within ThiA for the selective synthesis of 1, which can advance our understanding of the programming rules of fungal PKSs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boryl Ancillary Ligands: Influencing Stability and Reactivity of Amidinato&#8208;Silanone and Germanone Systems in Ammonia Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the nucleophilic addition of ammonia to ketones is an archetypal reaction in classical organic chemistry, the reactivity of heavier group 14 carbonyl analogues (R2E=O; E = Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb) with NH3 remains sparsely investigated, primarily due to the synthetic difficulties in accessing heavier ketone congeners. Herein, we present a room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue), formed from the corresponding silylene under a N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2). Quantum chemical cal&#8208;culations reveal that the formation of this sila&#8208;hemiaminal is crucially dependent on the nature of the ancillary ligand scaffold. It is facilitated thermodynamically by the hemi&#8208;lability of the amidinate ligand (which allows for the formation of an energetically critical intramolecular N&#8230;HO hydrogen bond within the product) and is enabled mechanistically by a process in which the silanone initially acts in umpolung fashion as a base (rather than an acid), due to the strongly electron&#8208;releasing and sterically bulky nature of the ancillary boryl ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Transesterification Induced Multifunctional Additives Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H2O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li+. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic&#8208;rich layer (e.g. Li3N/Li3P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high&#8208;performance electrolyte for LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a pragmatic choice for high&#8208;safety sodium batteries but still plagued by interfacial compatibility with both cathode and anode simultaneously. Here, salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer fibers with NaF salt inlaid in polylactide (PLA) fiber network was fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent in&#8208;situ forming gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte in liquid electrolytes. The obtained PLA&#8208;NaF GPE achieves a high ion conductivity (2.50 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and large Na+ transference number (0.75) at ambient temperature.

Aggregates with higher HOMO realizes the preferential oxidation on the cathode so that inorganic&#8208;rich and stable CEI covers cathode&#8217; surface, preventing particles&#8217; breakage and showing good compatibility with different cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2+2xFe2&#8208;x(SO4)3, Na0.72Ni0.32Mn0.68O2, NaTi2(PO4)3).

         <title>Cyclopropenimine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Activation for the Synthesis of Polyurethanes and Small&#8208;Molecule Carbonates and Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Given the adverse impact of CO2 on the atmosphere, it is of paramount importance to devise strategies for upcycling it into useful materials, such as polymers and fine chemicals. To activate such stable molecule, superbases offer viable modes of binding to CO2. In this study, a superbase cyclopropenimine derivative was found to exhibit exceptional proficiency in activating CO2 and mediating its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. The versatility of this reaction can be extended to monofunctional amines and alcohols, yielding a variety of functional carbonates and carbamates.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Supramolecular Polymers for Recyclable Photobiocatalytic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying enzymes with supramolecular polymers created SupEnzyme, endowing them with supramolecular functions and responsiveness to guest polymers. This approach significantly enhances enzyme recycling and offers advantages for photobiocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies. In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase&#8197;B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates through supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80&#8201;% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.

         <title>Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Synthesis of Propargyl&#8208; and Allenylsilanes through Catalytic Propargylic C&#8722;H Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular propargylic C&#8722;H silylation mediated by an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir complex. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric, synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity.







Abstract
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric and synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity. In the case of unsymmetrical dialkyl acetylenes, good to excellent selectivity for functionalization at the less&#8208;hindered site was also observed. A variety of electrophilic silyl sources (R3SiOTf and R3SiNTf2), either commercial or in situ&#8208;generated, were used as the silylation reagents, and a broad range of simple and functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkyl acetylenes, dialkyl acetylenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and drug derivatives were successfully employed as substrates. Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;&#8208;complexation&#8208;assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer&#8208;sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Electrokinetic Analyses Uncover the Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Biomass&#8208;Derived Monosaccharide Electroreduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical DHA conversion undergoes an initial dehydration and the subsequent hydrogenation to the acetol product. The electrokinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;determining step follows an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism, that is, increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone will promote the activity. At alkaline (local) pH, DHA conversion is a homogeneous chemical reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical biomass conversion holds promise to upcycle carbon sources and produce valuable products while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, deep insight into the interfacial mechanism is essential for the rational design of an efficient electrocatalytic route, which is still an area of active research and development. Herein, we report the reduction of dihydroxyacetone (DHA)&#8212;the simplest monosaccharide derived from glycerol feedstock&#8212;to acetol, the vital chemical intermediate in industries, with faradaic efficiency of 85&#177;5&#8201;% on a polycrystalline Cu electrode. DHA reduction follows preceding dehydration by coordination with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups and the subsequent hydrogenation. The electrokinetic profile indicates that the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) includes a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the dehydrated intermediate, revealed by coverage&#8208;dependent Tafel slope and isotopic labeling experiments. An approximate zero&#8208;order dependence of H+ suggests that water acts as the proton donor for the interfacial PCET process. Leveraging these insights, we formulate microkinetic models to illustrate its origin that Eley&#8211;Rideal (E&#8722;R) dominates over Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) in governing Cu&#8208;mediated DHA reduction, offering rational guidance that increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone would be sufficient to promote the activity in designing practical catalysts.

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Disila&#8208;carbocycles via Highly Selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the intermolecular &#963;&#8208;bond exchange reaction of two different C&#8722;Si bonds with high cross&#8208;redistribution selectivity, which serves as a ring expansion protocol to assemble diverse disila&#8208;carbocycles. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the presence of hydrogen on silicon of silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain for both of two substrates are critical to ensure the desired reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully inhibited the preferential homodimerization and C&#8722;Si/Si&#8722;H bond cross&#8208;exchange of benzosilacyclobutenes and monohydro&#8208;silacyclobutanes and achieved the first highly selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction by deliberately tuning the Ni&#8208;catalytic system, which constitutes a powerful and atom&#8208;economical ring expansion method for preparing medium&#8208;sized cyclic compounds bearing two silicon atoms at the ring junction, which are otherwise inaccessible. The DFT calculation explicitly elucidated the pivotal role of Si&#8722;H bond at silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain of two substrates in realizing the two C&#8722;Si bonds cleavage and reformation in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a surface&#8208;lattice&#8208;doping (SLD) strategy for the stabilization of the solid electrolyte/cathode interface for its working at a high voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. Specifically, a uniform AlPO4 coating layer was built with nanometer precision around the LiCoO2 (LCO) particle. The following sintering at high temperature induced a homogeneous Al3+ diffusion into the LCO crust, leading to a controlled degree of surface Al/Co/Li disorder together with the formed Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 islands decorating the LCO surface. We found that this SLD strategy is capable of not only suppressing the structural degradation of LCO itself, but also effectively mitigating the decomposition of the chloride&#8208;based solid electrolyte at the interface, thereby ensuring the assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a LiCoO2 cathode excellent cycling stability at 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8211;solid&#8211;state Li&#8211;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8211;doped, cation&#8211;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8211;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8211;salt&#8211;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5&#8197;V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8211;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5&#8197;V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8211;based ASSBs at high voltages.

Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8211;based ASSBs at high voltages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
