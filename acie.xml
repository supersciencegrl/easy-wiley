         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially&#8208;Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering of cell plasma membrane using functional DNA is important for study and control of cellular behaviors. However, most efforts limit to apply artificial DNA interactions on external cell membrane due to the lack of suitable synthetic tools to engineer intracellular side, which impedes many applications in cell biology. Inspired by natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we introduce a fusogenic spherical nucleic acid construct to realize robust DNA functionalization on both external and internal cell surfaces via liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT), enabling applications including construction of heterotypic cell assembly for programmed signaling pathway and detection of intracellular metabolites. This approach can engineer cell membrane in a highly efficient and spatially&#8208;controlled manner, allowing for building anisotropic membrane structure with two orthogonal DNA functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rational Design of a Multifunctional 3D Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Borax Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional 3D cross&#8208;linked polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8208;borax layer possesses good electrolyte wettability, K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and structural stability, enabling a stable K plating and stripping process for more than 700&#8197;h of cycling without dendrite formation.







Abstract
K metal is the optimal anode for K&#8208;ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issues due to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium&#8208;metal batteries, a 3D polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8201;(PVA)&#8208;borax layer is designed, which enables a dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;plating/stripping process. The protective layer possesses good wettability, high K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;borax (PVA&#8208;borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25&#8201;% DOD and 50&#8201;% DOD, the PVA&#8208;borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180&#8197;h and 100&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Performant All&#8208;Organic Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by PTCDA Electrodes and a Hybrid Na/Mg Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PTCDA is for the first time implemented as an anode active material for aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries, with a novel &#8220;hybrid&#8221; aqueous electrolyte based on inexpensive non&#8208;fluorinated salts. The hybrid electrolyte supresses material dissolution during cycling and enables all&#8208;organic electrodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies.







Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all&#8208;organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non&#8208;fluorinated Na/Mg&#8208;salts, it displays favourable physico&#8208;chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &gt;3&#8197;V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long&#8208;term sustainability, and improved safety.

         <title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;Catalyzed Carbenium Ion Generation and Autocatalytic Pyrazole Synthesis&#8212;A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions between vinyl diazoacetates and aryl esters afforded highly regioselective N&#8208;alkylated pyrazoles. These reactions involve an autocatalytic process in which in situ formed carbenium species act as a catalyst to regioselectively afford pyrazoles. Detailed DFT studies were carried out to explain the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In recent years, metal&#8208;free organic synthesis using triarylboranes as catalysts has become a prevalent research area. Herein we report a comprehensive computational and experimental study for the highly selective synthesis of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the generation of carbenium species from the reaction between aryl esters and vinyl diazoacetates in the presence of catalytic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. DFT studies were undertaken to illuminate the reaction mechanism revealing that the in situ generation of a carbenium species acts as an autocatalyst to prompt the regiospecific formation of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles in good to excellent yields (up to 81&#8201;%).

         <title>Remote C&#8211;H Pyridylation of Hydroxamates through Direct Photoexcitation of O&#8208;Aryl Oxime Pyridinium Intermediates**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient strategy for the remote C&#8211;H pyridylation of hydroxamates with excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity by designing a new class of photon&#8208;absorbing O&#8208;aryl oxime pyridinium salts generated in situ from the corresponding pyridines and hydroxamates. When irradiated by visible light, the photoexcitation of oxime pyridinium intermediates generates iminyl radicals via the photolytic N&#8211;O bond cleavage, which does not require an external photocatalyst. The efficiency of light absorption and N&#8722;O bond cleavage of the oxime pyridinium salts can be modulated through the electronic effect of substitution on the O&#8208;aryl ring. The resultant iminyl radicals enable the installation of pyridyl rings at &#947;&#8208;CN position, which yields synthetically valuable C2&#8208;substituted pyridyl derivatives. This novel synthetic approach provides significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and simplicity and exhibits broad functional group tolerance in complex settings under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids Provide Insight into the Mechanisms of CYP152 Peroxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a cis or trans C&#945;=C&#946; double bond in unsaturated fatty acid substrates dramatically changes the catalytic efficiency and chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity of three representative CYP152 peroxygenases including OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, and P450BS&#946;, which provides new insights into their unusual catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
CYP152 peroxygenases catalyze decarboxylation and hydroxylation of fatty acids using H2O2 as cofactor. To understand the molecular basis for the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of these unique P450 enzymes, we analyze the activities of three CYP152 peroxygenases (OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, P450BS&#946;) towards cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;dodecenoic acids as substrate probes. The unexpected 6S&#8208;hydroxylation of the trans&#8208;isomer and 4R&#8208;hydroxylation of the cis&#8208;isomer by OleTJE, and molecular docking results suggest that the unprecedented selectivity is due to OleTJE&#8217;s preference of C2&#8722;C3 cis&#8208;configuration. In addition to the common epoxide products, undecanal is the unexpected major product of P450SP&#945; and P450BS&#946; regardless of the cis/trans&#8208;configuration of substrates. The combined H218O2 tracing experiments, MD simulations, and QM/MM calculations unravel an unusual mechanism for Compound&#8197;I&#8208;mediated aldehyde formation in which the active site water derived from H2O2 activation is involved in the generation of a four&#8208;membered ring lactone intermediate. These findings provide new insights into the unusual mechanisms of CYP152 peroxygenases.

         <title>Azepine&#8208; or Azocine&#8208;Embedded Hexabenzocoronene Derivatives as Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Saddle or Saddle&#8208;Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographenes bearing an azepine ring and an azocine ring, respectively, were synthesized and saddle&#8208;shaped and saddle&#8208;helix structures were obtained. Notably, two synthetic routes were adopted for the synthesis, the azepine&#8208;embedded polyaromatic was prepared by using cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide instead of typical alkyne and tetraphenylcyclopenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one.







Abstract
Two novel nitrogen&#8208;doped, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based nanographenes (NGs) 1 and 2 bearing an azepine and an azocine at the fjord region, respectively, were synthesized and characterized. Notably, structure 1 was synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide, followed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and Scholl&#8208;type reactions, which represents a modified strategy to construct NGs. The azo&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded NG 1 leads to a saddle shape, and the azo&#8208;octagon&#8208;embedded NG 2 exhibits a distorted saddle&#8208;helix conformation with the largest torsion angle recorded so far in [5]helicenes. As a result, the different structural topographies for NGs 1 and 2 lead to significant changes in the optical properties including UV absorption and fluorescent emission. Additionally, the 8&#960;&#8208;heterocycles azepine and azocine in the NGs 1 and 2 exhibited obvious antiaromatic properties.

         <title>Vertical Graphene Arrays as Electrodes for Ultra&#8208;High Energy Density AC Line&#8208;Filtering Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field assisted PECVD method was developed to grow strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) as electrode materials of ECs. The EC&#8208;SVGAs with aqueous or organic electrolyte exhibit excellent CA of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &#934; of 80.6&#176;, and energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 120&#8197;Hz with arbitrary AC filtering performances, which is far better than most carbon&#8208;related devices, demonstrating the potential for replacement of conventional AECs.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). However, current electrodes are stuck in limited electrode area and tortuous ion transport. Herein, strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) prepared by electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition have been successfully designed as the main electrode to ensure ions rapidly adsorb/desorb in richly available graphene surface. SVGAs exhibit an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#934;120=80.6&#176; even after 500&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, which is far better than that of most carbon&#8208;related materials. Impressively, the output voltage could also be improved to 2.5&#8197;V when using organic electrolyte. An ultra&#8208;high energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can also be handily achieved. Moreover, ECs&#8208;SVGAs can well smooth arbitrary AC waveforms into DC signals, exhibiting excellent filtering performance.

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant 2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;Aminochroman Derivatives via Enzymatic Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalytic synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives was achieved with imine reductases (IREDs) at preparative scale, showing enantiocomplementary selectivity for most of the products and yields as high as 91&#8201;%. Precursors of Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT were successfully synthesised, as well as the Parkinson's disease agent Rotigotine in a 3&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives are key structural motifs present in a wide range of pharmaceutically important molecules. Herein, we report an effective biocatalytic approach towards these molecules through the enantioselective reductive coupling of 2&#8208;tetralones and 3&#8208;chromanones with a diverse range of primary amine partners. Metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs) were employed as the biocatalysts, obtaining high yields and enantiocomplementary selectivity for &gt;15 examples at preparative scale, including the precursors to Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT. We also present a convergent chemo&#8208;enzymatic total synthesis of the Parkinson's disease therapy Rotigotine in 63&#8201;% overall yield and 92&#8201;% ee.

With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels.







Abstract
Inspired by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), herein we have established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the ingenious introduction of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system into one side of artificial hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannel. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels. In view of these promising results, the use of artificial nanochannel to improve protein transport not only presents a new potential chemical model for biological research and better understanding of protein transport behavior in the living systems, but also provides a high&#8208;flux protein transporter device, which may have applications in the design of protein drug release systems, protein separation systems and microfluidics in the near future.

         <title>Insight into Carbocation Induced Non&#8208;covalent Interactions in Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins Reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbocations such as cyclic carbenium ions are important intermediates in zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction. The MTO reaction propagates through complex hydrocarbon pool process. Molecular understanding of the carbocation&#8208;involved hydrocarbon pool reaction still remains challenging. Here we show that electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentenyl cations stabilized in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite are able to capture alkane, methanol and olefins produced during MTO reaction via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Intermolecular spatial proximities/interactions are identified by using two&#8208;dimensional  13  C&#8208;  13  C correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Combined NMR experiments and theoretical analysis suggests that in addition to the dispersion and CH/&#960; interactions, the multiple functional groups in the cyclopentenyl cations produce strong attractive force via cation&#8208;induced dipole, cation&#8208;dipole and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. These carbocation&#8208;induced non&#8208;covalent interactions modulate the product selectivity of hydrocarbon pool reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Wrapped Multiple Resonance Fluorophors for Suppression of Concentration Quenching and Spectrum Broadening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters are promising for highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrowband emission; however, they still face intractable challenges with concentration&#8208;caused emission quenching, exciton annihilation, and spectral broadening. In this study, sterically wrapped MR dopants with a fluorescent MR core sandwiched by bulk substituents were developed to address the intractable challenges by reducing intermolecular interactions. Consequently, high photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields of &#8805;90% and small full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &#8804;25 nm over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1 wt%&#8208;20 wt%) were recorded. In addition, we demonstrated that the sandwiched MR emitter can effectively suppress Dexter interaction when doped in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, eliminating exciton loss through dopant triplet. Within the above dopant concentration range, the optimal emitter realizes remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3%&#8208;37.2%, identical small FWHMs of 24 nm, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although ether&#8208;based electrolytes have been extensively applied in anode evaluation of batteries, anodic instability arising from solvent oxidability is always a tremendous obstacle to matching with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Herein,   by rational design for solvation configuration, the fully coordinated   ether&#8208;based electrolyte with strong resistance against oxidation is reported, which remains anodically stable with high&#8208;voltage Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  2  O  2  F (NVPF) cathode under 4.5 V (versus Na  +  /Na) protected by an effective interphase   . The assembled   graphite//NVPF full cells  display  superior rate performance and  unprecedented cycling stability.  Beyond that  , the constructed full cells coupling the high&#8208;voltage NVPF cathode with both hard carbon and graphite anodes exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances in terms of high average output voltage up to 3.72 V, long&#8208;term cycle life (such as 95 % capacity retention after 700 cycles) and high energy density (247 W h kg  &#8208;1  ).  In short, the optimized ether&#8208;based electrolyte enriches systematic options, the ability to maintain oxidative stability and compatibility with various anodes, exhibiting attractive prospects for application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;Protein Cross&#8208;links (DPCs) between DNA epigenetic mark 5&#8208;formylC and lysine residues of histone proteins spontaneously form in human cells. Such conjugates are likely to influence chromatin structure and mediate DNA replication, transcription, and repair, but are challenging to study due to their reversible nature. Here we report the construction of site specific, hydrolytically stable DPCs between 5fdC in DNA and K4 of histone H3 and an investigation of their effects on DNA replication. Our approach employs oxime ligation, allowing for site&#8208;specific conjugation of histones to DNA under physiological conditions. Primer extension experiments revealed that histone H3&#8208;DNA crosslinks blocked DNA synthesis by hPol &#951; polymerase, but were bypassed following proteolytic processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Growth of Preferred&#8208;Oriented MOF Thin Film on Nanowire Array for High&#8208;Performance Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;quality MOF thin films with high orientation and controlled thickness are extremely desired for applications. However, they have been only successfully fabricated on flat substrates. Those MOF 2D thin films are limited by low exposed area and slow mass transport. To overcome these issues, MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, and precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on nanowire array substrate for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film is superior to corresponding 2D thin films and showed one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD, and fastest response among all reported chemiresistive NH  3  sensing materials at RT. This work provides a feasible approach to grow preferred&#8208;oriented 3D MOF thin film, offering new perspectives for constructing MOF&#8208;based heterostructures for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064 nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532 nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190 nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Clippane: a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) based on molecular tweezers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we report the preparation of a new mechanically interlocked molecule formed by the self&#8208;aggregation of two metallotweezers composed by two pyrene&#8208;imidazolylidene gold(I) arms and a pyridine&#8208;centered pentacyclic bis&#8208;alkynyl linker. The mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule arises from the presence of the bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups attached to the sides of the pyrene moieties of the arms of the tweezer, which act as stoppers avoiding the dissociation of the self&#8208;aggregated metallotweezer dimer once it is formed. By combining experimental techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we were able to confirm the mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule in solution, in the gas phase and in the solid state. The behavior of the tert&#8208;butyl substituted tweezer differs greatly form that shown by the tweezer lacking of these bulky groups, whose dimeric structure is in equilibrium with the monomeric structure, therefore not showing any mechanical coercion that avoids the disassembly of the self&#8208;aggregated structure. We used the term Clippane, to refer to this new two&#8208;component MIMs formed by entangled molecular tweezers or clefts. Thus, clippanes add to catenantes, rotaxanes and molecular knots as new members of the family of MIMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly&#8208;curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of supramolecular complexes between fullerene C  60  and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by&#160;  1  H NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor fullerene C  60  . Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale shows that the addition of C  60  to&#160;  NG&#8208;1  solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460 nm lead to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of one&#8208;electron reduced form of C  60&#160;  in benzonitrile is observed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ&#8208;GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ&#8208;GDH that show large (&gt;10 fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N&#8208; and C termini by ligand binding domain:ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.&#160; For instance, the concentration of Cyclosporine A could be measured in 1 ml of undiluted blood with the same accuracy as the leading diagnostic technique that uses 50 times more sample. We further used this biosensor to construct highly porous gold bioelectrodes capable of robustly detecting concentrations of Cyclosporine A as low as 20 pM and retained functionality in samples containing at least 60% human serum. These experiments suggest that the developed biosensor platform is generalizable and may be suitable for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care diagnostics</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Evolution of Selenium&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Modulated MoSe2 Precatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 was synthesized via a scalable salt&#8208;templated approach and investigated as a precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. MoSeS was identified as the actual electrocatalyst, which promoted conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S. When assembled into a battery, an impressive performance was observed, even with an elevated sulfur loading (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with a low electrolyte usage (4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S).







Abstract
Witnessing compositional evolution and identifying the catalytically active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li&#8211;S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive. We report the scalable salt&#8208;templated synthesis of Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;incorporated MoSe2 architecture (SeVs&#8208;MoSe2) and reveal the phase evolution of the defective precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 to MoSeS. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. The Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; 4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S). This work elucidates the design strategies and catalytic mechanisms of efficient electrocatalysts bearing defects.

The Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;). This work elucidates the design strategies and catalytic mechanisms of efficient electrocatalysts bearing defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Reveals Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell mass spectrometric method based on a dielectric barrier discharge ionization source was used to analyze multiple metabolites in different cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) at the single&#8208;cell level with a throughput of around 38 cells per minute.







Abstract
Even populations of clonal cells are heterogeneous, which requires high&#8208;throughput analysis methods with single&#8208;cell sensitivity. Here, we propose a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell analytical method based on active capillary dielectric barrier discharge ionization mass spectrometry, which can analyze multiple metabolites in single cells at a rate of 38 cells/minute. Multiple cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) were discriminated successfully. We found evidence for abnormal lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells. We also analyzed gene expression in a cancer genome atlas dataset and found that the mRNA level of a critical enzyme of lipid synthesis (ATP citrate lyase, ACLY) was upregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, both an ACLY chemical inhibitor and a siRNA approach targeting ACLY could suppress the viability of PDAC cells. A significant reduction in lipid content in treated cells indicates that ACLY could be a potential target for treating pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Photocatalytic Arylation of P4 and PH3: Reaction Development Through Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic studies provide significant, new insights into the mechanism of the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Through the first&#8208;time observation of a series of reaction intermediates, these studies have also inspired the development of the first examples of direct, catalytic arylation of PH3, which is a key synthetic intermediate for industrial phosphorus chemistry.







Abstract
Detailed 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic investigations provide deeper insight into the complex, multi&#8208;step mechanisms involved in the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Specifically, these studies have identified a number of previously unrecognized side products, which arise from an unexpected non&#8208;innocent behavior of the commonly employed terminal reductant Et3N. The different rate of formation of these products explains discrepancies in the performance of the two most effective catalysts, [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2][PF6] (dtbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and 3DPAFIPN. Inspired by the observation of PH3 as a minor intermediate, we have developed the first catalytic procedure for the arylation of this key industrial compound. Similar to P4 arylation, this method affords valuable triarylphosphines or tetraarylphosphonium salts depending on the steric profile of the aryl substituents.

         <title>Immobilizing Redox&#8208;Active Tricycloquinazoline into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework Cu&#8208;HHTQ with multiple redox&#8208;active sites originated from a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and a CuO4 unit was designed for Li&#8208;ion batteries with high capacity, extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. TQ was identified as redox activity with Li+ for the first time.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO4 unit into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li+ storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li+ for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO4 unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu&#8208;HHTQ (HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li+/e&#8722; transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. Our findings highlight an efficient strategy of constructing electrode materials for energy storage with combining multiple redox&#8208;active moieties into conductive MOFs.

         <title>Siloxy Esters as Traceless Activators of Carboxylic Acids: Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Aldol Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a chiral boron&#8208;catalyzed, carboxylic acid&#8208;selective asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates at late stages for the first time. Computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity through Si/B enediolates acting as the active species.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is among the most useful reactions in organic synthesis. Despite the existence of many prominent reports, however, the late&#8208;stage, chemoselective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction of multifunctional substrates is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we identified that in situ pre&#8208;conversion of carboxylic acids to siloxy esters facilitated the boron&#8208;catalyzed direct aldol reaction, leading to the development of carboxylic acid&#8208;selective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates. Combining experimental and computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and led to the proposal of Si/B enediolates as the active species. The silyl ester formation facilitated both enolization and catalyst turnover by acidifying the &#945;&#8208;proton of substrates and attenuating poisonous Lewis bases to the boron catalyst.

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) were tailored for the inhibition of trypsin&#8208;induced cell injury and angiogenin&#8208;induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating their great potentials as therapeutic drugs for disease treatment.







Abstract
Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs that exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing the angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells.

&lt;p&gt;Molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) were tailored for the inhibition of trypsin-induced cell injury and angiogenin-induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating their great potentials as therapeutic drugs for disease treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid-phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs that exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion-induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin-dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing the angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid Chelator that Can Remove Cu2+ from Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides and Stop the Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</title>

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;chelation from amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide complexes is a known approach towards the development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Herein we describe a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that removes Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn, forming the thermodynamically stable Cu&#8211;chelator complex, and by this enables the inhibition of ROS production in a reducing environment at physiological pH.







Abstract
Cu bound to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides can act as a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuropathologic degradation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An excellent therapeutic approach is to use a chelator that can selectively remove Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946;. This chelator should compete with Zn2+ ions (Zn) that are present in the synaptic cleft while forming a nontoxic Cu complex. Herein we describe P3, a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that selectively removes Cu2+ from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn and prevent the formation of ROS even in a reductive environment. We demonstrate, based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, that although P3 extracts Zn from Cu,Zn&#8211;A&#946; faster than it removes Cu, the formed Zn complexes are kinetic products that further dissociate, while CuP3 is formed as an exclusive stable thermodynamic product. Our unique findings, combined with the bioavailability of peptoids, make P3 an excellent drug candidate in the context of AD.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bound Dense Micelle Brush Supports for Continuous Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forest&#8208;like micellar brushes fabricated under an ambient environment in glass capillaries enable flexible decoration of various nanocatalysts and subsequently permit a broad range of continuous flow transformations. Notably, this strategy is feasible for short and long capillaries, allowing the preparation of flow reactors with significantly higher throughput.







Abstract
Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in&#8197;situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions, and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.

         <title>Exploring Ultrafast Photoswitching Pathways in RbMnFe Prussian Blue Analogue</title>

Time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy combined to electronic band structure calculations revealed two photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer pathways for RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Photoexcitation of &#945; spins couples to reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion that induces CT, while photoexcitation of &#946; spins induces Fe&#8594;Mn CT, stabilized by a spin transition. Lattice torsion modes play an important role for accommodating local distortions and stabilizing CT.







Abstract
We study by femtosecond optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy the photoinduced charge transfer (CT) in the RbMnFe Prussian blue analogue. Previous studies evidenced the local nature of the photoinduced MnIIIFeII &#8594; MnIIFeIII process, occurring within less than 1&#8197;ps. Here we show experimentally that two photoswitching pathways exist, depending on the excitation pump wavelength, which is confirmed by band structure calculations. Photoexcitation of &#945; spins corresponds to the Mn(d&#8208;d) band, which drives reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through the population of antibonding Mn&#8208;N orbitals, and induces CT within &#8776;190&#8197;fs. The process launches coherent lattice torsion during the self&#8208;trapping of the CT small&#8208;polaron. Photoexcitation of &#946; spins drives intervalence Fe&#8594;Mn CT towards non&#8208;bonding states and results in a slower dynamic.

Using a catalytic system comprised of Pd and Xantphos, acid chlorides can be added across strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to form two new C&#8722;C bonds via formal C&#8722;COCl cleavage. This reaction allows for a dicarbofunctionalisation in which an acid chloride group is retained in the product. DFT studies are used to rationalise a plausible pathway, while product derivatisation highlights the synthetic utility of the method.







Abstract
Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8722;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or a tethered alkyne to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride in situ. The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.

         <title>Unraveling a Ligand&#8208;Induced Twist of a Homodimeric Enzyme by Pulsed Electron&#8211;Electron Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23419-23426, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR or DEER), an equilibrium was observed between the functional and the twisted dimer of the enzyme tRNA&#8208;guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a virulence&#8208;relevant target of shigellosis, which depends on the chemical structure of the bound ligand. The experiments suggest a dissociation&#8211;association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer.







Abstract

         <title>Li2MTeO6 (M=Ti, Sn): Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Wide Transparency Range</title>

New tellurate LTT and LST crystals were obtained by a TSSG method with a broad transparent region of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m for MIR NLO applications. Both LTT and LST belong to the space group Pnn2, with an almost identical structure. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder SHG response. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder SHG based on the crystal structures.







Abstract
Oxide crystals have been widely used in nonlinear optics (NLO) in the ultraviolet&#8211;visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Most traditional oxide crystals are restricted to the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxides has attracted much attention. Herein, we report two new tellurates Li2TiTeO6 (LTT) and Li2SnTeO6 (LST) with broad transparent regions of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, as excellent candidates for mid&#8208;infrared NLO applications. Both LTT and LST crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnn2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064&#8197;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. They also pave a way for the design of new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Constructing a Carbon&#8208;Particle&#8208;Modified Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhancing the Efficiency of CO2 Electroreduction into Formate</title>

To improve the catalytic performance of MOFs in CO2RR, a strategy to introduce suitable precursor to in situ generate carbon nanoparticles was adopted. Introduced carbon nanoparticles serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in the framework, and sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy gives impetus to construct more effective catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been widely investigated, but insufficient conductivity limits application. Herein, a porous 3D In&#8208;MOF {(Me2NH2)[In(BCP)]&#8901;2&#8201;DMF}n (V11) with good stability was constructed with two types of channels (1.6 and 1.2&#8197;nm diameter). V11 exhibits moderate catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction with 76.0&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEHCOO&#8208;). Methylene blue molecules of suitable size and pyrolysis temperature were introduced and transformed into carbon particles (CPs) after calcination. The performance of the obtained CPs@V11 is significantly improved both in FEHCOO&#8208; (from 76.0&#8201;% to 90.1&#8201;%) and current density (2.2 times). Control experiments show that introduced CPs serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in framework, and benefit to sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy can also work on other In&#8208;MOFs, demonstrating the universality of this method for electroreduction of CO2.

Abstract
Immobilization of a phosphonated cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst on TiO2 nanoparticles generates a photocatalyst that allows coupling aqueous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (CO and H2) reduction to selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates or cellulose to formate. An enzymatic saccharification pre&#8208;treatment process is employed that enables the use of insoluble cellulose as an electron&#8208;donating substrate under benign aqueous conditions suitable for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. The hybrid photocatalyst consists of solely earth&#8208;abundant components, and its heterogeneous nature allows for reuse and operation in aqueous solution for several days at 25&#8201;&#176;C, reaching a cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion yield of 17&#8201;%. Thus, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for valorizing two waste streams (CO2 and biomass) simultaneously into value&#8208;added chemicals through solar&#8208;driven catalysis is demonstrated.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of a Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>

Semiconductive trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) containing Ag&#8722;S bonds were synthesized using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted techniques. One of the obtained CPs, [Ag2Httc]n (KGF&#8208;6), features a three dimensionally extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with one&#8208;dimensional column structures of stacked triazine rings. This network structure provides segregated paths for holes and electrons (see picture).







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;sulfur bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties. However, the development of new (&#8208;M&#8208;S&#8208;)n&#8208;structured CPs is hindered by difficulties with their crystallization. Herein, we describe the use of machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8722;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag2Httc]n, features a 3D&#8208;extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag2Httc]n is highly photoconductive (&#966;&#931;&#956;max=1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs with selective topologies that are difficult to crystallize.

&lt;/sub&gt; (KGF-6), features a three dimensionally extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with one-dimensional column structures of stacked triazine rings. This network structure provides segregated paths for holes and electrons (see picture).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;sulfur bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties. However, the development of new (-M-S-)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-structured CPs is hindered by difficulties with their crystallization. Herein, we describe the use of machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ttc)-based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8722;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Httc]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, features a 3D-extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first-principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time-resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Httc]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; is highly photoconductive (&lt;i&gt;&#966;&lt;/i&gt;&#931;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=1.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs with selective topologies that are difficult to crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

CoFe alloy and Co metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide was obtained through a temperature dependent cation exchange reaction and exhibited superior Li&#8208;O2 battery performance, including higher specific capacity, lower overpotential, and better cycling stability.







Abstract
A temperature&#8208;controlled cation&#8208;exchange approach is introduced to achieve a unique dual&#8208;exsolution in perovskite La0.8Fe0.9Co0.1O3&#8722;&#948; where both CoFe alloy and Co metal are simultaneously exsolved from the parent perovskite, forming an alloy and metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide. Mossbauer spectra show that cation exchange of Fe atoms in CoFe alloy and Co cations in the perovskite is the key to the co&#8208;existence of Co metal and CoFe alloy. The obtained composite exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity as Li&#8208;O2 battery cathode catalysts with a specific discharge capacity of 6549.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a cycling performance of 215&#8197;cycles without noticeable degradation. Calculations show that the combination of decorated CoFe alloy and Co metal synergistically modulated the discharge reaction pathway that improves the performance of Li&#8208;O2 battery.

         <title>Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic&#8208;Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>

Novel genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), R&#8208;CatchER and G&#8208;CatchER2, with ultrafast kinetics and large fluorescence dynamic ranges are introduced. R&#8208;CatchER was applied to sense multi&#8208;scale calcium dynamics in endoplasmic reticulum. A design principle of GECIs is proposed that features a tuning of rapid dynamics and electrostatic potentials of fluorescent proteins.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;scale calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, exhibiting wide&#8208;ranging temporal kinetics, constitutes a ubiquitous mode of signal transduction. We report a novel endoplasmic&#8208;reticulum&#8201;(ER)&#8208;targeted Ca2+ indicator, R&#8208;CatchER, which showed superior kinetics in&#8197;vitro (koff&#8805;2&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1, kon&#8805;7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and in multiple cell types. R&#8208;CatchER captured spatiotemporal ER Ca2+ dynamics in neurons and hotspots at dendritic branchpoints, enabled the first report of ER Ca2+ oscillations mediated by calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs), and revealed ER Ca2+&#8208;based functional cooperativity of CaSR. We elucidate the mechanism of R&#8208;CatchER and propose a principle to rationally design genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators with a single Ca2+&#8208;binding site and fast kinetics by tuning rapid fluorescent&#8208;protein dynamics and the electrostatic potential around the chromophore. The design principle is supported by the development of G&#8208;CatchER2, an upgrade of our previous (G&#8208;)CatchER with improved dynamic range. Our work may facilitate protein design, visualizing Ca2+ dynamics, and drug discovery.

         <title>A Simple Gas&#8211;Solid Treatment for Surface Modification of Li&#8208;Rich Oxides Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23248-23255, October 18, 2021. </description>

A simple gas&#8211;solid treatment of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with ferrous oxalate is proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancies and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with high capacity are expected to be the next generation of cathode materials. However, the irreversible and sluggish anionic redox reaction leads to the O2 loss in the surface as well as the capacity and voltage fading. In the present study, a simple gas&#8211;solid treatment with ferrous oxalate has been proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancy and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion. In addition, the surface doping of Fe&#8208;ion can further stabilize the structure. Accordingly, the treated Feox&#8208;2&#8201;% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% and 85.5&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C and 2&#8197;C to that (75.3&#8201;% and 75.0&#8201;%) of the pristine sample after 300&#8197;cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011&#8197;V per cycle at 2&#8197;C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides cathode.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveals In Situ Behaviors of Multiple Components in Aerosol Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23225-23231, October 18, 2021. </description>

A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to map and quantify the sub&#8208;organ distribution and translocation of inhaled carbonaceous aerosol is reported. The method provides not only spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub&#8208;organ level, but also chemical changes of multiple components.







Abstract
The inhalation of atmospheric particles is deleterious to human health. However, as a complex mixture, tracing the behaviors of multiple components from real aerosol particles is crucial but unachievable by the existing methods. Here, taking advantage of the intrinsic fingerprints of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in carbonaceous aerosol (CA) upon laser irradiation, we proposed a label&#8208;free mass spectrometry imaging method to visualize and quantify the deposition, translocation and component variation of CA in organs. With this method, the heterogeneous deposition, clearance and release behavior of CA in lung, that more OC was released in parenchyma and OC was cleared faster than EC, was observed. The translocation of CA to extrapulmonary organs including kidney, liver, spleen and even brain was also verified and quantified. By comparing the ratio of OC to EC, an organ&#8208;specific release behavior of OC from CA during circulation was revealed. In orthotopic lung and liver tumor, OC was found to penetrate more into tumor foci than EC. This technique provides deeper information for understanding the systemic health effects of aerosol particles.

By comparing the ratio of OC to EC, an organ-specific release behavior of OC from CA during circulation was revealed. In orthotopic lung and liver tumor, OC was found to penetrate more into tumor foci than EC. This technique provides deeper information for understanding the systemic health effects of aerosol particles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Dopant&#8208;Promoted Electroreduction of CO2 over Coordinatively Unsaturated Ni&#8208;N2 Moieties</title>

A potential&#8208;dependent stability of doped S atom was observed in the dual&#8208;heteroatom anchored unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst prepared by a rapid microwave&#8208;induced plasma method. Sulfur dopants including coordinated S atoms and evolutive S vacancies effectively modulate coordination environment around Ni sites and further facilitate the CO2 reduction over the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N2 moieties.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) moieties are promising for efficient electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, it is essential but challenging to steer the coordination environment of Ni centers for promoting the CO formation kinetics. Here, we introduce alien sulfur atoms to tune the local electronic density of unsaturated NiN2 species. A coordinated structure evolution is detected and S vacancies are generated at high overpotentials, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The sulfur dopants enhance CO selectivity and activity over normal unsaturated NiN2 structure, reaching a high CO Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a large CO current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;cell at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and &#8722;0.9&#8197;V (vs. RHE), respectively. DFT calculations reveal both doped S atoms and evolved S vacancies in the NiN2 coordination environment contribute to the reduced energy barriers for CO2 electroreduction to CO.

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

Direct cross&#8208;coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with alkylamine and aldehyde feedstocks has been achieved. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained with generally good yields and optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible with excellent stereocontrol. This method provides a novel disconnection strategy for the synthesis of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes that utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.

         <title>Bright Luminescence in Three Phases&#8212;A Combined Synthetic, Spectroscopic and Theoretical Approach</title>

The photoluminescence of Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au (M=Cu, Ag, Au) &#8220;molecular wire&#8221; complexes was studied in detail by comparative measurements in solution, in the solid state and in the gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Combining phase&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements and quantum chemical calculations is a powerful approach to help understand the influence of the molecular surroundings on the PL properties. Herein, a phosphine functionalized amidinate was used to synthesize a recently presented bimetallic gold complex, featuring an unusual charge separation. The latter was subsequently used as metalloligand to yield heterotetrametallic complexes with an Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au &#8220;molecular wire&#8221; arrangement (M=Cu, Ag, Au) featuring metallophilic interactions. All compounds show bright phosphorescence in the solid state, also at ambient temperature. The effect of the molecular environment on the PL was studied in detail for these tetrametallic complexes by comparative measurements in solution, in the solid state and in the gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.

         <title>Parent B2N2&#8208;Perylenes with Different BN Orientations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23313-23319, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of parent B2N2&#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations have been synthesized based on the BN&#8208;naphthalene building block. The effects of BN with different orientations on structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties are systematically investigated. This work provides an efficient synthetic strategy for BN&#8208;PAHs and a deep insight into the structure&#8211;property relationship of BN&#8208;PAHs.







Abstract
Introducing BN units into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons expands the chemical space of conjugated materials with novel properties. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific BN positions and orientations. Here, three new parent B2N2&#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations are synthesized with BN&#8208;naphthalene as the building block, providing systematic insight into the effects of BN incorporation with different orientations on the structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties. The intermolecular dipole&#8211;dipole interaction shortens the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance. The crystal structure, (anti)aromaticity, and photophysical properties vary with the change of BN orientation. The revealed BN doping effects may provide a guideline for the synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific stacking structures, and the synthetic strategy employed here can be extended toward the synthesis of larger BN&#8208;embedded PAHs with adjustable BN patterns.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Phase&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Induced Domino Phase Transition and Luminescence Switching for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23373-23379, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline phase recognition promoted the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transition of a metal halide by inducing a domino phase transition (DPT). A DPT occurred when single crystals of chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) recognized those of achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (see picture). Concomitant photoluminescence switching enabled in situ observation of the DPT, the potential of which for time&#8208;resolved encryption was demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein, a new mechanism, namely, crystalline phase recognition (CPR), is proposed for the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition of metal halides. Chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) can recognize achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 on the basis of a key&#8211;lock feature through intercontact of their single crystals, resulting in a domino phase transition (DPT). The concomitant photoluminescence (PL) switching enables observation of the DPT in situ. The liquid eutectic interface, stress&#8211;strain transfer, and feasible thermodynamics are key issues for the CPR. DFT calculations and PL measurements revealed that the optical absorption and emission of the isomers mainly originate from [SbCl5]2&#8722; anions. The structural effects (e.g., supramolecular interactions and [SbCl5]2&#8722; distortion) on the optical emission are clarified. As a novel type of stimuli response, the CPR&#8208;induced DPT and luminescence switching exhibit potential for application in advanced time&#8208;resolved information encryption.

&lt;p&gt;Crystalline phase recognition promoted the single-crystal-to-single-crystal transition of a metal halide by inducing a domino phase transition (DPT). A DPT occurred when single crystals of chiral &#946;-[Bmmim]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (Bmmim=1-butyl-2,3-methylimidazolium) recognized those of achiral &#945;-[Bmmim]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (see picture). Concomitant photoluminescence switching enabled in situ observation of the DPT, the potential of which for time-resolved encryption was demonstrated.

         <title>Programmable Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of DNA Origami with Polynucleotide Brushes</title>

Surface&#8208;initiated TdT&#8208;catalyzed polymerization enables the programmable, site&#8208;specific modification of DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes of different heights and compositions. The brush layer protects the origami core from nuclease degradation, which enables the application of DNA origami&#8208;based nanostructures for smart drug delivery and other biomedical applications.







Abstract
Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized DNA nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.

Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles comprising multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core is described. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers and the number of layers can be tailored as desired, making complex particle design possible.







Abstract
Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles of diameters 100&#8211;150&#8197;nm comprising well&#8208;defined multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core was conducted using surfactant&#8208;free aqueous macroRAFT emulsion polymerization. The imposed constraints on chain mobility as well as chemical incompatibility between the blocks result in microphase separation, leading to formation of an onion&#8208;like multilayered particle morphology with individual layer thicknesses of approximately 20&#8197;nm. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers as well as the number of layers can be tailored as desired, offering more complex particle design compared to approaches relying on self&#8208;assembly of preformed diblock copolymers within particles. Microphase separation can occur in these systems under conditions where the corresponding bulk system would not theoretically result in microphase separation.

Chemoselective probes based on stable isotope labeling allow for highly sensitive mass spectrometric quantification and detection of metabolites at attomole quantities in three human sample types.







Abstract
The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host's physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics&#8208;driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our chemical biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.

         <title>A Copper(I) Complex with Two Unpaired Electrons, Synthesised by Oxidation of a Copper(II) Complex with Two Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>

Oxidation&#8208;induced reduction: The oxidation of mononuclear CuII complexes with novel unsymmetric redox&#8208;active urea azine or thio&#8208;urea azine ligands leads to metal reduction and formation of complexes with intriguing electronic structures. The stability in several redox states is the basis for their first application in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)2] and [Cu(L2)2] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)2]+ and [Cu(L2)2]+ with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)2]+ is best described as a CuI complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)2]+ is a CuI complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)2]2+, best described as a CuI complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile ligand&#8208;metal electron transfer make these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;PROTAC Conjugates (APCs) for Tumor&#8208;Specific Targeting in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23299-23305, October 18, 2021. </description>

The first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed to improve the tumor specific targeting and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. This strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in PROTAC&#8208;based drug development.







Abstract
Development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is emerging as a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation. However, the drug development using the heterobifunctional PROTAC molecules is generally limited by poor membrane permeability, low in vivo efficacy and indiscriminate distribution. Herein an aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugation approach was developed as a novel strategy to improve the tumor&#8208;specific targeting ability and in vivo antitumor potency of conventional PROTACs. As proof of concept, the first aptamer&#8208;PROTAC conjugate (APC) was designed by conjugating a BET&#8208;targeting PROTAC to the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 (AS) via a cleavable linker. Compared with the unmodified BET PROTAC, the designed molecule (APR) showed improved tumor targeting ability in a MCF&#8208;7 xenograft model, leading to enhanced in vivo BET degradation and antitumor potency and decreased toxicity. Thus, the APC strategy may pave the way for the design of tumor&#8208;specific targeting PROTACs and have broad applications in the development of PROTAC&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Single Particle Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals the Catalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Co3O4 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23444-23450, October 18, 2021. </description>

SECCM and the single&#8208;particle&#8208;at&#8208;the&#8208;tip approach are allied to gain insight into the activity of individual Co3O4 nanocube particles towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The single&#8208;particle&#8208;at&#8208;the&#8208;tip approach offers the ability to perform accelerated stress tests combined with HR&#8208;TEM to observe structural changes of the nanoparticle during electrocatalysis at high current densities.







Abstract
Co3O4 nanocubes are evaluated concerning their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by means of single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co3O4 nanocube of a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;nanoelectrode measurements of Co3O4 nanocubes provide an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.92&#8197;V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such high current densities combined with identical&#8208;location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer during electrocatalysis. Combining two independent single&#8208;entity electrochemistry techniques provides the basis for elucidating structure&#8211;activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well&#8208;defined surface structure.

         <title>Designing Anion&#8208;Type Water&#8208;Free Zn2+ Solvation Structure for Robust Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23357-23364, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free Zn2+ solvation structure electrolyte for developing a Zn metal anode. The chloride salt with bulky cations unlocks the Zn2+&#8208;water interactions, and a new solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722; is formed without bound water. Owing to the limited hydrogen evolution reaction and the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and anion, the electrolyte shows an average Zn plating/stripping CE of &#8776;99.9&#8201;% and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries are potential for large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage due to their low cost and high security. However, Zn metal anode suffers from the dendritic growth and interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in the deterioration of electrode/battery performance. Here we propose that both dendrites and HER are related to the water participated Zn2+ solvation structure&#8208;Zn(H2O)62+ and thus can be resolved by transforming Zn(H2O)62+ to an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722;, which is achieved in traditional ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte after adding chloride salt with a bulky cation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). The elimination of cation&#8208;water interaction suppresses HER, while the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and the anion solvation structure inhibits dendrite formation. As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.9&#8201;%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles in anode&#8208;free Zn batteries with pre&#8208;zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long&#8208;lifespan metal anode.

Utilizing the promiscuous C3&#8208;indole methyl transferase PsmD enabled the enantioselective synthesis of various pyrroloindolines. By additionally applying the halo methyl transferase CtHMT not only the expensive SAM cofactor could be recycled, but also the enzymatic preparative scale transformation was achieved.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM&#8208;dependent methyl transferase PsmD from Streptomyces griseofuscus, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope were demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.

         <title>Discovery and Characterisation of Highly Cooperative FAK&#8208;Degrading PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23327-23334, October 18, 2021. </description>

A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.







Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718.

&lt;p&gt;A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X-ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK-PROTAC-VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK-degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS-4718. X-ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK-GSK215-VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in-vitro pharmacology compared to VS-4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long-lasting effect on FAK levels (&#8776;96&#8197;h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK-degradation biology in&#8197;vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biochemistry&#8208;Guided Prediction of the Absolute Configuration of Fungal Reduced Polyketides</title>

We performed a focused analysis of functionally related polyketide synthases (PKSs) which produce linear polyketides (PKs) such as prophialotide and other polyhydroxy PKs. The relative and absolute configurations were determined by degradation studies. Based on the results, we propose a stereochemical rule during the chain&#8208;elongation process of the reduced PKs.







Abstract
Highly reducing polyketide synthases (HR&#8208;PKSs) produce structurally diverse polyketides (PKs). The PK diversity is constructed by a variety of factors, including the &#946;&#8208;keto processing, chain length, methylation pattern, and relative and absolute configurations of the substituents. We examined the stereochemical course of the PK processing for the synthesis of polyhydroxy PKs such as phialotides, phomenoic acid, and ACR&#8208;toxin. Heterologous expression of a HR&#8208;PKS gene, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase gene, and a truncated non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase gene resulted in the formation of a linear PK with multiple stereogenic centers. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centers were determined by chemical degradation followed by comparison of the degradation products with synthetic standards. A stereochemical rule was proposed to explain the absolute configurations of other reduced PKs and highlights an error in the absolute configurations of a reported structure. The present work demonstrates that focused functional analysis of functionally related HR&#8208;PKSs leads to a better understanding of the stereochemical course.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Heterobimetallic Gold&#8211;Iron Complex Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine)Silyliumylidene</title>

The selective synthesis of a silyliumylidene&#8208;stabilized mononuclear Au&#8722;Fe complex, by a convenient one&#8208;pot reaction starting from bis&#8208;NHI silyliumylidene chloride, is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallography, IR and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, as well as computations suggest a zwitterionic Si(II)+&#8722;Au(I)+&#8722;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8722; bonding motif with rare anagostic CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au contacts and considerable backbonding capabilities of the silyliumylidene.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of the first bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic imine&#8208;stabilized chlorosilyliumylidene 1 is reported. Remarkably, consecutive reaction of 1 with PPh3AuCl and K2Fe(CO)4 gives rise to the unique heterobimetallic complex 1,2&#8208;(MesNHI)2&#8208;C2H4&#8208;ClSiAuFe(CO)4 (4). The overall neutral complex 4 bears an unusual linear Si&#8722;Au&#8722;Fe structure and a rare anagostic interaction between the d10&#8208;configured gold atom and a CH bond of the mesityl ligand. According to the computational analysis and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, the formal Fe&#8208;oxidation state remains at &#8722;II. Thus, the electronic structure of 4 is best described as an overall neutral&#8212;yet zwitterionic&#8212;heterobimetallic &#8220;Si(II)+&#8208;Au(I)+&#8208;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8722;&#8221;&#8208;silyliumylidene complex, derived from double anion exchange. The computational analysis indicates strong hyperconjugative back donation from the gold(I) atom to the silyliumylidene ligand.

         <title>PtSe2/Pt Heterointerface with Reduced Coordination for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

Ultra&#8208;small Pt particles are generated in situ on the surface of PtSe2 nanosheet with Se vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
PtSe2 is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe2/Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe2, enabled by an in situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H. intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2/Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.

meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives has been achieved by using a bulky rhodium catalyst under a CO2 atmosphere.

Abstract
A meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation reaction of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives with CO2 by using a rhodium catalyst with NaOiPr as a stoichiometric reductant has been achieved. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the meta&#8208;position of the aryl ring with high selectivity over the ortho&#8208;positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration and successive 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium shift.

   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr as a stoichiometric reductant has been achieved. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-position of the aryl ring with high selectivity over the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4-rhodium migration and successive 1,2-rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl-to-aryl 1,2-rhodium shift.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium Ion Repulsion&#8208;Enrichment Synergism Induced by Core&#8211;Shell Ionic Complexes to Enable High&#8208;Loading Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A core&#8211;shell additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as core and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as shell is proposed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The gradually released POM cores with negative charge enrich Li+ and co&#8208;assemble with Li. The Li+ repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
A core&#8211;shell additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as core and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as shell is proposed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The suspended POM derived complex in ether&#8208;based electrolyte is absorbed around the protuberances of anode and triggers a lithiophobic repulsion mechanism for the homogenization of Li+ redistribution. The gradually released POM cores with negative charge then enrich Li+ and co&#8208;assemble with Li. The Li+ repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce solid electrolyte interphase. This sustained&#8208;release additive enables Li&#8741;Li symmetric cells with a long lifetime over 500&#8197;h and 300&#8197;h at high current densities of 3 and 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. The complex additive is also compatible with high&#8208;voltage Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cells. Even with a NCA loading as high as ca. 20&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the additive contained Li&#8741;NCA cell can still cycle for over 100&#8197;cycles at 2.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework derived CuxOyCz Catalyst for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and Impact of Local pH Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23427-23434, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nanostructured CuxOyCz electrocatalysts were synthesized from Cu&#8208;based MOF precursors. The catalysts were blended with PTFE for preparation of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to suppress hydrogen evolution by preventing electrowetting process. The local OH&#8722; ion activities of working GDEs were determined in absence and presence of PTFE to exclude interference in local OH&#8722; ion generation in the vicinity of GDE by PTFE.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to produce value&#8208;added chemicals has been intensively pursued. We report a series of CuxOyCz nanostructured electrocatalysts derived from a Cu&#8208;based MOF as porous self&#8208;sacrificial template. Blending catalysts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. 25 to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% teflonized GDEs exhibited a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;54&#8201;% for C2+ products at &#8722;80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The local OH&#8722; ions activity of PTFE&#8208;modified GDEs was assessed by means of closely positioning a Pt&#8208;nanoelectrode. A substantial increase in the OH&#8722;/H2O activity ratio due to the locally generated OH&#8722; ions at increasing current densities was determined irrespective of the PTFE amount.

         <title>The Significance of Properly Reporting Turnover Frequency in Electrocatalysis Research</title>

Turnover frequency (TOF) serves as an accurate descriptor of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst. However, if it is reported at all, it has not been accurately determined in most of the recent studies on electrocatalytic reactions involving both fuel generation and fuel consumption. This Viewpoint stresses the significance of realistic TOF data in the development of new electrocatalysts.







Abstract
For decades, turnover frequency (TOF) has served as an accurate descriptor of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst, including those in electrocatalytic reactions involving both fuel generation and fuel consumption. Unfortunately, in most of the recent reports in this area, TOF is often not properly reported or not reported at all, in contrast to the overpotentials at a benchmarking current density. The current density is significant in determining the apparent activity, but it is affected by catalyst&#8208;centric parasitic reactions, electrolyte&#8208;centric competing reactions, and capacitance. Luckily, a properly calculated TOF can precisely give the intrinsic activity free from these phenomena in electrocatalysis. In this Viewpoint we ask: 1)&#8197;What makes the commonly used activity markers unsuitable for intrinsic activity determination? 2)&#8197;How can TOF reflect the intrinsic activity? 3)&#8197;Why is TOF still underused in electrocatalysis? 4)&#8197;What methods are used in TOF determination? and 5)&#8197;What is essential in the more accurate calculation of TOF? Finally, the significance of normalizing TOF by Faradaic efficiency (FE) is stressed and we give our views on the development of universal analytical tools to determine the exact number of active sites and real surface area for all kinds of materials.

The digitization of chemistry requires that synthesis procedures can be written and optimized in a chemical programming language to perform reliable &#8220;chemputation&#8221; for the synthesis on the &#8220;chemputer&#8221; robot, a universal synthesis machine. The cover image shows how a universal chemical synthesis engine equipped with an NMR sensor can be used to optimize reactions producing the automated synthesis procedure as an optimized process code ensuring that the chemputation can be improved and is reliable. Details are reported by Leroy Cronin, Franziska Emmerling et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;23202.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The digitization of chemistry&lt;/b&gt; requires that synthesis procedures can be written and optimized in a chemical programming language to perform reliable &#8220;chemputation&#8221; for the synthesis on the &#8220;chemputer&#8221; robot, a universal synthesis machine. The cover image shows how a universal chemical synthesis engine equipped with an NMR sensor can be used to optimize reactions producing the automated synthesis procedure as an optimized process code ensuring that the chemputation can be improved and is reliable. Details are reported by Leroy Cronin, Franziska Emmerling et&#8197;al. in their Communication on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202106323"&gt;page&#8197;23202&lt;/a&gt;.

A novel mass spectrometry imaging strategy to trace and quantify carbonaceous particles in&#8197;situ is reported by Jie Sun, Caiqiao Xiong, Zongxiu Nie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;23225. The method provides not only the spatial biodistribution of carbonaceous aerosol at sub&#8208;organ level, but also chemical information on multiple components from these particles based on their intrinsic fingerprints upon laser ablation. This work provides a new opportunity to understand how ambient particles translocate and release their surface organic matter in&#8197;vivo.

Femtosecond optical spectroscopy and DFT calculations are used by Hiroko Tokoro, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi, Eric Collet, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;23267 to investigate photomagnetism in the RbMnFe material. Two photoswitching pathways with different dynamics are found. The initial electronic excitation may launch first the reverse Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion or the intervalence Fe&#8211;Mn charge transfer.

Recent advances in biorthogonal click chemistry have broadened the scope of bioimaging and bioanalytical studies applied to a large array of molecular targets in vivo as well as ex vivo. Here, we discuss the hurdles encountered when targeting intracellular compartments by metabolic labeling and other approaches, and present the solutions currently being developed to improve the efficiency of click ligations in living cells.







Abstract
The surging development of bioorthogonal chemistry has profoundly transformed chemical biology over the last two decades. Involving chemical partners that specifically react together in highly complex biological fluids, this branch of chemistry now allows researchers to probe biomolecules in their natural habitat through metabolic labelling technologies. Chemical reporter strategies include metabolic glycan labelling, site&#8208;specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids in proteins, and post&#8208;synthetic labelling of nucleic acids. While a majority of literature reports mark cell&#8208;surface exposed targets, implementing bioorthogonal ligations in the interior of cells constitutes a more challenging task. Owing to limiting factors such as membrane permeability of reagents, fluorescence background due to hydrophobic interactions and off&#8208;target covalent binding, and suboptimal balance between reactivity and stability of the designed molecular reporters and probes, these strategies need mindful planning to achieve success. In this review, we discuss the hurdles encountered when targeting biomolecules localized in cell organelles and give an easily accessible summary of the strategies at hand for imaging intracellular targets.

In this review, we discuss the hurdles encountered when targeting biomolecules localized in cell organelles and give an easily accessible summary of the strategies at hand for imaging intracellular targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Efficacy of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors through Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23068-23082, October 18, 2021. </description>

Fluorination can have important beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, but these effects can sometimes be difficult to predict. Using the vast amount of data obtained on selective, fluorinated inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, this Minireview attempts to give general guidelines on how to wisely insert fluorine atoms within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
The insertion of fluorine atoms and/or fluoroalkyl groups can lead to many beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, such as enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability, as well as a strengthening of protein&#8211;ligand binding interactions. However, this &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of fluorine atom(s) insertion can often be meaningless. Taking advantage of the wide range of data coming from the quest for carbonic anhydrase (CA) fluorinated inhibitors, this Minireview attempts to give &#8220;general guidelines&#8221; on how to wisely insert fluorine atom(s) within an inhibitor moiety to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand&#8211;protein interactions, depending on the target location of the fluorine substitution in the ligand. Multiple approaches such as ITC, kinetic and inhibition studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy are useful in dissecting single binding contributions to the overall observed effect. The exploitation of innovative directions made in the field of protein and ligand&#8208;based fluorine NMR screening is also discussed to avoid misconduct and finely tune the exploitation of selective fluorine atom insertion in the future.

         <title>A Heteromeric Carboxylic Acid Based Single&#8208;Crystalline Crosslinked Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23176-23181, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework was synthesized through heteromeric monomer co&#8208;crystallization followed by thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking. The crosslinked porous crystals featured large pores to host a hydrazone switch for solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;patterning.







Abstract
The development of large pore single&#8208;crystalline covalently linked organic frameworks is critical in revealing the detailed structure&#8208;property relationship with substrates. One emergent approach is to photo&#8208;crosslink hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals. Introducing complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonded carboxylic acid building blocks is promising to construct large pore networks, but these molecules often form interpenetrated networks or non&#8208;porous solids. Herein, we introduced heteromeric carboxylic acid dimers to construct a non&#8208;interpenetrated molecular crystal. Crosslinking this crystal precursor with dithiols afforded a large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework HCOF&#8208;101. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed HCOF&#8208;101 as an interlayer connected hexagonal network, which possesses flexible linkages and large porous channels to host a hydrazone photoswitch. Multicycle Z/E&#8208;isomerization of the hydrazone took place reversibly within HCOF&#8208;101, showcasing the potential use of HCOF&#8208;101 for optical information storage.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Spirolactams via Sequential C&#8722;H Olefination/Asymmetric [4+1] Spirocyclization under a Simple CoII/Chiral Spiro Phosphoric Acid Binary System</title>

An unprecedented sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple CoII/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported, providing a straightforward route for the asymmetric synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with high enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple CoII/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported. A range of biologically important spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams are obtained with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The concise, asymmetric synthesis of an aldose reductase inhibitor was successfully achieved. Notably, contrast to previous reports that relied on the use of cyclopentadienyl or its derivatives (achiral Cp*, CptBu, or chiral Cpx) ligated CoIII complexes requiring tedious steps to prepare, cheap and commercially available cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate was used as an efficient precatalyst.

Shagene&#8197;A, which exhibits strong toxicity against Leishmania donovani, a protozoan that causes leishmaniasis, contains an intriguing strained structure that includes a multisubstituted cyclopropane. This study reports the first total synthesis of shagenes&#8197;A and B via Ru&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis of an enamide and Ir&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond isomerization of an alkylidenecyclopropane. The total synthesis suggested the absolute configuration of shagenes.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of shagenes&#8197;A and B, which are tricyclic terpenoids containing a cis&#8208;substituted cyclopropane, via ring&#8208;closing metathesis of an enamide and Ir&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond isomerization of an alkylidenecyclopropane. Chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity in the distorted cis&#8208;substituted structures were controlled by the alkylidenecyclopropane reactivity and using the ketone functionality as a remote directing group for the Ir catalyst, respectively. The total synthesis suggested the absolute configuration of shagenes.

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2/Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23182-23186, October 18, 2021. </description>

We report an efficient and scalable cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocol that employs catalytic hydroquinone with tBuOOH as a benign terminal oxidant. A bromide additive was crucial to obtaining good yields and excellent cis selectivity. The study culminates in the implementation of the optimized reaction on large scale.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO2, which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from trans to cis diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high cis selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large&#8208;scale applications.

&lt;p&gt;The 1,4-diacyloxylation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which limit process sustainability and large-scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large-scale applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Detection of Cu+ Ions in Live Cells via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23148-23153, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a new fluorescent probe that upon binding to copper(I) (but not any other physiologically relevant metal ions), displays an intensity switch&#8208;on as well as a significant change in its fluorescence lifetime. The latter has allowed us to visualize copper(I) in live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
Copper is an essential trace element in living organisms with its levels and localisation being carefully managed by the cellular machinery. However, if misregulated, deficiency or excess of copper ions can lead to several diseases. Therefore, it is important to have reliable methods to detect, monitor and visualise this metal in cells. Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch&#8208;on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color Tuning of Narrowband Emission in Multi&#8208;resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescence Materials through Rational Imine/Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23142-23147, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile design strategy enabled wide&#8208;range color tuning of narrowband emissions in organoboron luminogenic molecules. The introduction of imine and amine moieties into a boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton (see structures) caused hypsochromic and bathochromic emission band shifts, respectively, thereby leading to deep&#8208;blue to yellow narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence with excellent color purity.







Abstract
Establishing a simple and versatile design strategy to finely modulate emission colors while retaining high luminescence efficiency and color purity remains an appealing yet challenging task for the development of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials. Herein, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing imine and electron&#8208;donating amine moieties into a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton enables systematic hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts of narrowband emissions, respectively. By this method, effective electroluminescence color tuning was accomplished over a wide visible range from deep&#8208;blue to yellow (461&#8211;571&#8197;nm), using the same MR molecular system, without compromising very narrow spectral features. Deep&#8208;blue to yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 19.0&#8211;29.2&#8201;% and superb color purity could be produced with this family of color&#8208;tunable MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>The Reaction of CO2 with a Borylnitrene: Formation of an 3&#8208;Oxaziridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23112-23116, October 18, 2021. </description>

Triplet borylnitrene 1 reacts photochemically (&#955;&gt;550&#8197;nm) under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions with CO2, which is known for its high thermodynamic and kinetic stability, to give a strained and unprecedented 3&#8208;oxaziridinone motif 2.







Abstract
The reaction of a borylnitrene with carbon dioxide is studied under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions. Photogenerated CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with CO2 under formation of the cycloaddition product CatBNCO2, a 3&#8208;oxaziridinone derivative, after photoexcitation (&gt;550&#8197;nm). The product shows Fermi resonances between the CO stretching and ring deformation modes that cause unusual 13C and 18O isotopic shifts. A computational analysis of the 3&#8208;oxaziridinone shows this cyclic carbamate to be less strained than an &#945;&#8208;lactone or an &#945;&#8208;lactame.

         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;mediated reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates by ball milling is reported. The process has been optimised and its mechanism explored by CV measurements, radical trapping, and EPR spectroscopy. Control experiments identify the action of ball milling rather than mortar and pestle is necessary to realise the effective activation of manganese, which can then be used in either solution or a ball mill for subsequent reactions.







Abstract
Efforts to generate organomanganese reagents under ball&#8208;milling conditions have led to the serendipitous discovery that manganese metal can mediate the reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates. The newly uncovered process has been optimized and its mechanism explored using CV measurements, radical trapping experiments, EPR spectroscopy, and solution control reactions. This unique reactivity can also be translated to solution whereupon pre&#8208;milling of the manganese is required.

Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4; and EuS, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4 were prepared. The phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.







Abstract
In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu3S4, EuSm2S4, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.

Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed-valent ferromagnets Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and EuSm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, EuSm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, SmS&lt;sub&gt;1.9&lt;/sub&gt;, and Sm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed EuS while EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is used to intentionally passivate the VI in the CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite thin films. The synergistic effect of Lewis base&#8211;acid interaction and H&#8208;bond strengthens the adsorption of HA molecules on the surface of perovskite. The fabricated PSCs with HA passivation significantly reduced the number of uncoordinated Pb2+ and achieved a record 20.8&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Iodine vacancies (VI) and undercoordinated Pb2+ on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films are mainly responsible for nonradiative charge recombination. An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is used to passivate the VI in perovskite films. A theoretical study shows that HA bonds to the VI on the surface of the perovskite film via a Lewis base&#8211;acid interaction; an additional hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) strengthens such interaction owing to the favorable molecular configuration of HA. Undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters are passivated, leading to significantly reduced surface trap density and prolonged charge lifetime within the perovskite films. HA passivation also induces an upward shift of the energy band edge of the perovskite layer, facilitating interfacial hole transfer. The combination of the above raises the solar cell efficiency from 19.5 to 20.8&#8201;% under 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 illumination, the highest efficiency so far for inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>Subsurface&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Induced Local Charge of Copper for an On&#8208;Surface Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23123-23127, October 18, 2021. </description>

By subsurface doping with carbon, local charge is introduced to the surface Cu atoms of Cu(111), which enables an instant on&#8208;surface displacement reaction. The well&#8208;defined and robust Cu&#948;+ surface offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis. The strategy based on subsurface doping with non&#8208;metal atoms provides an efficient path to improve the catalytic performance of the parent metal.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal carbides have sparked unprecedented enthusiasm as high&#8208;performance catalysts in recent years. Still, the catalytic properties of copper carbide remain unexplored. By introducing subsurface carbon to Cu(111), a displacement reaction of a proton in a carboxyl acid group with a single Cu atom is demonstrated at the atomic scale and room temperature. Its occurrence is attributed to the C&#8208;doping&#8208;induced local charge of surface Cu atoms (up to +0.30&#8197;e/atom), which accelerates the rate of on&#8208;surface deprotonation via reduction of the corresponding energy barrier, thus enabling the instant displacement of a proton with a Cu atom when the molecules adsorb on the surface. This well&#8208;defined and robust Cu&#948;+ surface based on subsurface&#8208;carbon doping offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis.

A continuous flow platform that is able to concatenate multiple steps for rapid, multi&#8208;gram production of orthogonally protected deoxy&#8208;sugars is described. Intermediate purification of compounds is avoided by the ability to run telescoped sequences of 2&#8211;4 chemical transformations. Through the use of Mechwolf, an open&#8208;source, Python&#8208;controlled program, automation of the flow processes was achieved.







Abstract
An automated continuous flow system capable of producing protected deoxy&#8208;sugar donors from commercial material is described. Four 2,6&#8208;dideoxy and two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy sugars with orthogonal protecting groups were synthesized in 11&#8211;32&#8201;% overall yields in 74&#8211;131.5&#8197;minutes of total reaction time. Several of the reactions were able to be concatenated into a continuous process, avoiding the need for chromatographic purification of intermediates. The modular nature of the experimental setup allowed for reaction streams to be split into different lines for the parallel synthesis of multiple donors. Further, the continuous flow processes were fully automated and described through the design of an open&#8208;source Python&#8208;controlled automation platform.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of the 6,10&#8208;Bicyclic Eunicellane Skeleton by the Bacterial Diterpene Synthase Bnd4</title>

         <dc:description>
Enzymatic and mechanistic characterization of Bnd4, a bacterial diterpene synthase and the first terpene synthase known to form the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic eunicellane skeleton, is reported. Isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the cyclization mechanism for benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene. An unusual DNxxxD motif was found to be essential for cyclization activity.







Abstract
The eunicellane diterpenoids are a unique family of natural products seen in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. We used a series of biochemical, bioinformatics, and theoretical experiments to investigate the mechanism of the first diterpene synthase known to form the eunicellane skeleton. Deuterium labeling studies and quantum chemical calculations support that Bnd4, from Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4), forms the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic skeleton through a 1,10&#8208;cyclization, 1,3&#8208;hydride shift, and 1,14&#8208;cyclization cascade. Bnd4 also demonstrated sesquiterpene cyclase activity and the ability to prenylate small molecules. Bnd4 possesses a unique D94NxxxD motif and mutation experiments confirmed an absolute requirement for D94 as well as E169.

         <title>The Structure of Cyclodecatriene Collinolactone, its Biosynthesis, and Semisynthetic Analogues: Effects of Monoastral Phenotype and Protection from Intracellular Oxidative Stress</title>

Collinolactone shares the same carbon scaffold with rhizolutin and X&#8208;ray crystallography has provided the absolute configuration. A highly non&#8208;collinear gene cluster was identified. Studies of cell viability using fluorescence microscopy revealed that analogues of collinolactone induce the formation of a monopolar spindle phenotype while collinolactone showed neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular oxidative stress.







Abstract
Recently described rhizolutin and collinolactone isolated from Streptomyces G&#246;&#8197;40/10 share the same novel carbon scaffold. Analyses by NMR and X&#8208;Ray crystallography verify the structure of collinolactone and propose a revision of rhizolutin's stereochemistry. Isotope&#8208;labeled precursor feeding shows that collinolactone is biosynthesized via type&#8197;I polyketide synthase with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation. CRISPR&#8208;based genetic strategies led to the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and a high&#8208;production strain. Chemical semisyntheses yielded collinolactone analogues with inhibitory effects on L929 cell line. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that only particular analogues induce monopolar spindles impairing cell division in mitosis. Inspired by the Alzheimer&#8208;protective activity of rhizolutin, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of collinolactone and its analogues on glutamate&#8208;sensitive cells (HT22) and indeed, natural collinolactone displays distinct neuroprotection from intracellular oxidative stress.

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23202-23206, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal chemical synthesis platform was extended by online NMR to allow adjustments of the encoded reactions on the fly. The approach was demonstrated on the class of Grignard reactions showing robust analytical results under harsh conditions. Real&#8208;time process analytics and the use of straightforward feedback control algorithm enhance the usability of available synthesis formula considering existing deviations.







Abstract
A big problem with the chemistry literature is that it is not standardized with respect to precise operational parameters, and real time corrections are hard to make without expert knowledge. This lack of context means difficult reproducibility because many steps are ambiguous, and hence depend on tacit knowledge. Here we present the integration of online NMR into an automated chemical synthesis machine (CSM aka. &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; which is capable of small&#8208;molecule synthesis using a universal programming language) to allow automated analysis and adjustment of reactions on the fly. The system was validated and benchmarked by using Grignard reactions which were chosen due to their importance in synthesis. The system was monitored in real time using online&#8208;NMR, and spectra were measured continuously during the reactions. This shows that the synthesis being done in the Chemputer can be dynamically controlled in response to feedback optimizing the reaction conditions according to the user requirements.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling Induced Debonding of Surface Atoms from Metal Bulk for Construing High&#8208;Performance Dual&#8208;Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

S,N co&#8208;doped carbon immobilized Co single atoms exhibit superior performance in amine self&#8208;coupling reaction, which can be attributed to the superiorities of such dual&#8208;site catalysts in boosting O2 activation and amine adsorption, simultaneously.







Abstract
One of the most pressing challenges in single&#8208;atom catalysis is the manipulation of the coordination environment of central metals to maximize the catalyst performance. Herein, we fabricated a high&#8208;performance catalyst (Co&#8208;SNC) by introducing S into the neighboring position of the Co&#8208;N4 coordination. The developed ball&#8208;milling method enabled large&#8208;scale synthesis, that over 4.7&#8197;g of Co&#8208;SNC can be produced in one pot. In benzylamine coupling reaction, Co&#8208;SNC exhibited the highest conversion of 97.5&#8201;% with 99&#8201;% selectivity toward N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine in 10&#8197;h among various Co catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed the crucial role of S atoms, which serve as the active sites for O2 activation, leaving the Co atoms free to adsorb benzylamine. Consequently, the adsorption energies of O2 and benzylamine were significantly increased. Our strategy suggests a feasible approach to enhance catalytic performance by delicately integrating dual active sites into a single catalyst unit.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids has been developed. Several non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, and ketoprofen were synthesized in high yields and ees in gram scale.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydroxycarbonylation is one of the most fundamental yet challenging methods for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. Herein, we reported the development of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water. A monodentate phosphoramidite ligand L6 plays vital role in the reaction. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups, and provides a facile and atom&#8208;economical approach to an array of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids including several commonly used non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The catalytic system has also enabled an asymmetric Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with alcohols to afford 2&#8208;arylpropanates. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the hydropalladation is irreversible and is the regio&#8208; and enantiodetermining step, while hydrolysis/alcoholysis is probably the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Intragenomic Decarboxylation of 5&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 43, Page 23207-23211, October 18, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possibility that 5&#8208;carboxydC (cadC), which is a modification found in somatic and stem cells, is directly decarboxylated to dC via C&#8722;C bond cleavage in cells is suggested.







Abstract
Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleosides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three additional dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intragenomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. By using metabolic labelling, we show here that cadC decarboxylates in several cell types, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8722;C bond cleavage.

These are 5-hydroxymethyl-dC (hmdC), 5-formyl-dC (fdC), and 5-carboxy-dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intragenomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. By using metabolic labelling, we show here that cadC decarboxylates in several cell types, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8722;C bond cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ruthenium&#8208;NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones to simple 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones has been developed with high yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Direct enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds to generate chiral three&#8208;dimensional motifs is one of the most straightforward and important approaches in synthetic chemistry. We realized the Ru(II)&#8208;NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild reaction conditions. Alkyl&#8208;, aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted optically active dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones were obtained in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The reaction provides an efficient and atom&#8208;economic pathway to construct simple chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones. The desired products could be further reduced to tetrahydroquinolines and octahydroquinolones.

A novel, robust and scalable electrochemical route for synthesis of N&#8208;cyanosulfilimines is described. The reaction provides good to excellent yields for dialkyl and alkylaryl sulfilimines. Compared to established routes no external oxidizers or strong bases are required. The synthesis provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by further oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate.







Abstract
A novel and very simple to perform electrochemical approach for the synthesis of several N&#8208;cyanosulfilimines in good to excellent yields was established. This method provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by consecutive oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate. This route can be easily scaled&#8208;up to gram quantities. The S,N coupling is carried out at an inexpensive carbon anode by direct oxidation of sulfide. Therefore, the designed process is atom economic and represents a new &#8220;green route&#8221; for the synthesis of sulfilimines and sulfoximines.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;artificial Photoelectrochemical Tandem Leaf with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Efficiency Approaching 1&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
Formate dehydrogenase was interfaced with a perovskite to produce a photocathode that benefits from an optimized local enzyme environment via the electrolyte solution and achieves an unprecedented current density. Combination with a BiVO4 water oxidation photoanode gave a bias&#8208;free biophotoelectrochemical tandem leaf with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry can combine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic light&#8208;absorbers with enzymes evolved for selective fuel&#8208;forming reactions such as CO2 reduction, but the overall performance of such hybrid systems has been limited to date. Here, the electrolyte constituents were first tuned to establish an optimal local environment for a W&#8208;formate dehydrogenase to perform electrocatalysis. The CO2 reductase was then interfaced with a triple cation lead mixed&#8208;halide perovskite through a hierarchically structured porous TiO2 scaffold to produce an integrated photocathode achieving a photocurrent density of &#8722;5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode during simulated solar light irradiation. Finally, the combination with a water&#8208;oxidizing BiVO4 photoanode produced a bias&#8208;free integrated biophotoelectrochemical tandem device (semi&#8208;artificial leaf) with a solar CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate energy conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronic Isolation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an electronic isolation strategy to produce persistent and stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling of a meta&#8208;substituted monomer. The polymer exhibited chemical robustness, localized radical feature, high spin density, and broad yet strong absorption. The radical polymer applied in photothermal conversion yielded unprecedented performance of record&#8208;high temperature of 268&#8201;&#176;C and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronic isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta&#8208;position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevents them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow band gap of 0.68&#8197;eV, strong yet extended UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption up to 1800&#8197;nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record&#8208;high photothermal temperature increment of &#8776;&#8764;240&#8201;&#176;C and striking solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of electronic isolation of radicals for producing outstanding photothermal materials.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cochlearol&#8197;B via Intramolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. Utilization of Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction, oxidative cyclization and intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, resulted in the completion of the total synthesis with 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of synthesized intermediate and cochlearol&#8197;B clearly confirmed the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B, a meroterpenoid natural product featuring a 4/5/6/6/6&#8208;fused pentacyclic structure. Key steps, oxidative cyclization and subsequent intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which constructed the pentacyclic structure in highly stereoselective manner, allowed efficient access to cochlearol&#8197;B with the longest linear sequence of 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly confirmed the stereochemistry of cochlearol&#8197;B.

         <title>Tuneable Time Delay in the Burst Release from Oxidation&#8208;Sensitive Polymersomes Made by PISA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes made by PISA based on thioether&#8208;functionalized polymers as membrane&#8208;forming block show a spontaneous membrane destabilization once a critical degree of oxidation is reached. Fine&#8208;tuning of the degradation time can be performed either by adjusting the membrane thickness or by partial pre&#8208;oxidation and can be further exploited to tailor the burst release of encapsulated dyes or enzymes in the presence of specific triggers.







Abstract
Reactive polymersomes represent a versatile artificial cargo carrier system that can facilitate an immediate release in response to a specific stimulus. The herein presented oxidation&#8208;sensitive polymersomes feature a time&#8208;delayed release mechanism in an oxidative environment, which can be precisely adjusted by either tuning the membrane thickness or partial pre&#8208;oxidation. These polymeric vesicles are conveniently prepared by PISA allowing the straightforward and effective in situ encapsulation of cargo molecules, as shown for dyes and enzymes. Kinetic studies revealed a critical degree of oxidation causing the destabilization of the membrane, while no release of the cargo is observed beforehand. The encapsulation of glucose oxidase directly transforms these polymersomes into glucose&#8208;sensitive vesicles, as small molecules including sugars can passively penetrate their membrane. Considering the ease of preparation, these polymersomes represent a versatile platform for the confinement and burst release of cargo molecules after a precisely adjustable time span in the presence of specific triggers, such as H2O2 or glucose.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Grown Chloride Perovskite Crystal of Red Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs2NaxAg1&#8722;xInCl6:y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na+ and Mn2+, the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (ca. 100&#8201;%) and a long duration time (&gt;5400&#8197;s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals.

We report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs2NaxAg1&#8722;xInCl6:y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na+ and Mn2+, the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (ca. 100&#8201;%) and a long duration time (&gt;5400&#8197;s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals. The energy transfer (ET) process between self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41&#8201;%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na+, was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps. Cryogenic afterglow measurements suggested that the afterglow phenomenon was likely governed by thermal&#8208;activated exciton diffusion and electron tunneling process.

         <title>Enantioselective Gel Phase Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of MOMs in gels: Gel phase synthesis of metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) resulted in homochiral MOMs, which were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The chirality of the gelator dictated the handedness of the MOMs and the enantioselectivity was confirmed by solid&#8208;state circular dichroism experiments.







Abstract
We report the asymmetric synthesis of homochiral metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) in chiral gels from achiral components. The enantioselectivity of MOMs depends on the chirality of the gel, whereas the synthesis performed in solution phase and achiral gels resulted in conglomerates.

         <title>Optimized synthesis of solution&#8208;processable crystalline poly(triazine imide) with minimized defects for OLED application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline semiconducting carbon nitrides are chemically and physically resilient, consist of earth abundant elements, and can be exfoliated into 2D atomically thin layers. In particular, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) is a highly crystalline semiconductor, and though no techniques exist to date that enable synthesis of macroscopic monolayers of PTI, it is possible to study it in thin layer device applications that are compatible with its polycrystalline, nanoscale morphology. In our study, we find that the by&#8208;product of conventional PTI synthesis is a C&#8208;C carbon rich phase that is detrimental for charge transport and photoluminescence. An optimised synthetic protocol yields a PTI material with an increased quantum yield, enabled photocurrent and electroluminescence. In addition, we report that protonation of the PTI structure happens preferentially at the pyridinic nitrogen atoms of the triazine (C  3  N  3  ) rings, is accompanied by exfoliation of PTI layers, and contributes to increases in quantum yield and exciton lifetimes. This study describes structure&#8208;property relationships in PTI that link (i) the nature of defects, their formation, and how to avoid them with (ii) the optical and electronic performance of PTI. On the basis of our findings, we create an OLED prototype with PTI as the active, metal&#8208;free material, and we lay the foundations for device integration of solution&#8208;processable graphitic carbon nitride dispersions in semiconductor devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Taking advantages of the versatile functionality and tunable energy dissipation, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) emerge as a rising star to afford multimodal theranostics platform. Nevertheless, the construction of AIE&#8208;active phototheranostic agent in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8722;1700 nm) which allows superior resolution and minimized photodamage is still a formidably challenging suffering from the limited candidate of building blocks. Herein, benzo[c]thiophene is innovatively utilized as electron&#8208;rich and bulky donor (D)/&#960;&#8208;bridge which can enlarge the conjugation length and distort the backbone. By precise D/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering, highly stable NIR&#8208;II AIEgen DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ NPs with acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence quantum yield and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 40.6% under 808 nm laser irradiation are successfully obtained. In addition, the exactly spatial conformation of DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ is determined for the first time by associating X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction and theoretical simulations, elaborately revealing the relationship between structure and AIE effect/photothermal performance. Extensive  in vitro  tests demonstrate that DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ NPs with good biocompatibility show efficient photothermal therapeutic effects. Furthermore, their prominent performance on fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal eradication of tumor is verified in HepG2 and B16&#8208;F10 tumor&#8208;xenografted mice, demonstrating distinguished cancer theranostic capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins through the synthesis of a diverse, sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesterol transport proteins regulate a vast array of cellular processes including lipid metabolism, vesicular and nonvesicular trafficking, organelle contact sites, and autophagy. Despite their undoubted importance, the identification of selective modulators of this class of proteins has been challenging due to the structural similarities in the cholesterol&#8208;binding site. Herein we report a general strategy for the identification of selective inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins  via  the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection. Fusion of a primary sterol fragment to an array of secondary privileged scaffolds led to the identification of potent and selective inhibitors of the cholesterol transport protein Aster&#8208;C, which displayed a surprising preference for the unnatural sterol AB&#8208;ring stereochemistry, and new inhibitors of Aster&#8208;A. We propose that this strategy can, and should be applied to any therapeutically relevant sterol&#8208;binding protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering lattice oxygen activation of iridium clusters stabilized on amorphous bimetal borides array for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ  18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Short&#8208;Wavelength Phase&#8208;Matching Second Harmonic Generation in Boron&#8208;Rich Borosulfate with Planar [BO3] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals which can produce short&#8208;wavelength lasers via a direct second harmonic generation (SHG) process are of great importance in modern laser technology. Currently, the exploration of UV NLO crystals in borosulfates is nearly stagnant since the non&#8208;phase matching (PM) property lies on the small birefringence induced by the intrinsically small optical anisotropy of the tetrahedral groups. Herein, for the first time, the planar [BO3] units were introduced into borosulfates leading to a boron&#8208;rich borosulfate (NH4)2B4SO10 with unprecedented [B4SO10]&#8734; layers and evidently enhanced birefringence. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the shortest SHG PM wavelength of 252 nm in all reported borosulfates with deep UV cutoff edge (184 nm), large SHG response (1.1 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 0.15 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO at 532 nm) and large birefringence (0.056 at 1064 nm) and is easy to grow single crystals via simple chemical vapor deposition method. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing planar [BO3] units to optimize&#160;birefringence of borosulfates, and also open up broad prospects for UV NLO crystals in boron&#8208;rich borosulfates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Molecular Basis of the Catalytic Mechanism of Geranyl Pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 Methyltransferase: Creation of an Unprecedented Farnesyl Pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenyl pyrophosphate methyltransferases enhance the structural diversity of terpenoids. However, the molecular basis of their catalytic mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, using multiple strategies, we characterized a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C&#8208;6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA. Biochemical analysis revealed that BezA requires Mg  2+  and solely methylates GPP. The crystal structures of BezA and its complex with  S  &#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved at 2.10 &#197; and 3.00 &#197;, respectively. Further analyses using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Importantly, the function of E170 as a catalytic base to complete the methylation reaction was established. We also succeeded in switching the substrate specificity by introducing a W210A substitution, resulting in an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 methyltransferase.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast yet accurate prediction for the activity of a nanostructured catalyst is an essential but challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. Despite some successful attempts on describing energetic parameters in different adsorption environments, a general solution to building direct structure&#8208;reactivity relationship quantitatively has not yet been established. On the basis of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we developed a kinetic model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity for reaction systems which are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes. We applied this kinetic model to investigate the size&#8208; and shape&#8208;effects of Cu nano&#8208;catalysts in the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for nano&#8208;catalyst with size over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic nano&#8208;catalyst with size of 877 nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might have been expected. The present model is expected to enhance the kinetic investigations of various chemical systems of interest, especially in chemical systems that are important in hydrogen economics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface terminations&#160;of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti  3  C  2  T  x  ) considerably impact its physicochemical properties.&#160;Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8211;F surface&#160;terminations or metallic impurities in MXene.&#160;We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to&#160;synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  . Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus,&#160;&#160;no metallics are present in the Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  product. The&#160;surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8211;Cl to &#8211;O and/or &#8211;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the the variety of surface terminations.&#160;The obtained &#8211;O&#8208;terminated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225 F g  &#8208;1  at 1.0 A g  &#8208;1  , good rate performance (91.1% at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ) and excellent capacitance retention (100 % after 10000 charging&#8208;discharging cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), which is superior to multi&#8208;layered Ti  3  C  2  T  x  prepared by other etching methods.</dc:description>

         <title>La3Ga3Ge2S3O10: An&#160;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxysulfide Designed by Anion&#8208;Directed Band Gap Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide&#8208;containing compounds have been widely studied as infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, they have never been applied in the ultraviolet (UV) region owing to the high energy levels of chalcogen anions, leading to band gap narrowing. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a new UV NLO oxysulfide La  3  Ga  3  Ge  2  S  3  O  10  with an exceptionally wide band gap of 4.70 eV due to from the unique anion&#8208;ordered frameworks comprising 1D  1  &#165;  [(Ga  3/5  Ge  2/5  )  3  S  3  O  3  ] triangular tubes and 0D (Ga  3/5  Ge  2/5  )  2  O  7  dimers of corner&#8208;sharing (Ga/Ge)S  2  O  2  and (Ga/Ge)O  4  tetrahedra, respectively. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements revealed that La  3  Ga  3  Ge  2  S  3  O  10  was phase matchable with twice the SHG response of KH  2  PO  4  . The results of theoretical calculations suggest that the strong SHG response is mainly attributable to the S&#8208;3  p  and O&#8208;2  p  orbitals in the occupied states. The anion&#8208;directed band&#8208;gap engineering may give insights into the application of NLO oxychalcogenides in the UV regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Kinetic Resolution and Asymmetric Induction within a Borrowing Hydrogen Cascade Mediated by a Single Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanistic uniqueness and versatility of borrowing hydrogen catalysis provides an opportunity to investigate the controllability of a cascade reaction, and more importantly, to realize either one or both of chiral recognition and chiral induction simultaneously. Here we report that, in a borrowing hydrogen cascade starting from racemic allylic alcohols, one of the enantiomers could be kinetically resolved, while the other enantiomer could be purposely converted to various targeted products, including &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones and &#947;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. By employing a robust Ru&#8208;catalyst, both kinetic resolution and asymmetric induction were achieved with remarkable levels of efficiency and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that corresponding catalyst&#8208;substrate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are pivotal to realize the observed stereochemical diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA tiling enables precise acylation&#8208;based labeling and control of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for site&#8208;selective labeling of long, native RNAs are needed for studying mRNA biology and future therapies. Current approaches involve engineering RNA sequences, which may alter folding, or are limited to specific sequences or bases. Here, we describe a versatile strategy for mRNA conjugation via a novel DNA tiling approach. The method, TRAIL, exploits a pool of &#8220;protector&#8221; oligodeoxynucleotides to hybridize and block the mRNA, combined with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA that extrudes a reactive RNA loop for acylation at a predetermined site. Using TRAIL, an azido&#8208;acylimidazole reagent was employed for labeling and controlling RNA for multiple applications  in vitro  and in cells, including analysis of RNA&#8208;binding proteins, imaging mRNA in cells, and analysis and control of translation. The TRAIL approach offers an efficient and accessible way to label and manipulate RNAs of virtually any length or origin without altering native sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Simultaneous Imaging of Acidification and Proteolysis in Single Phagosomes Using Bifunctional Janus Particle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The digestion of pathogens inside phagosomes by immune cells occurs through a sequence of reactions including acidification and proteolysis, but how the reactions are orchestrated in the right order is unclear due to a lack of methods to simultaneously measure more than one reaction in phagosomes. Here we report a bifunctional Janus particle probe to simultaneously monitor acidification and proteolysis in single phagosomes in live cells. Each probe consists of a pH reporter and a proteolysis reporter that are spatially separated but function concurrently. Using the Janus probes, we found the acidic pH needed to initiate and maintain proteolysis, revealing the mechanism for the sequential occurrence of both reactions during pathogen digestion. We showed how bacterium&#8208;derived lipopolysaccharide alters the acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. This study showcases the Janus particle probes as a generally applicable tool for monitoring multiple reactions in intracellular vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Ratiometric Nanothermometry Regulated by Tailoring Annihilators of Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanomicelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a special non&#8208;linear photophysical process that converts low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons based on sensitizer/annihilator pairs. This unique ability of TTA upconversion is especially useful for bio&#8208;applications because the longer&#8208;wavelength light source not only has a larger penetration depth that offers a longer working distance but also is distinguished from the intrinsic auto&#8208;fluorescence that reduces background interference. Moreover, adding stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to TTA upconversion will provide a unique platform for chemosensing and biosensing. Here, we successfully constructed a novel luminescence ratiometric nanothermometer based on TTA upconversion nanomicelles by encapsulating sensitizer/annihilator molecules into a temperature&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic triblock polymer. These TTA upconversion nanomicelles exhibited good linear relationships between the luminescence ratio (integrated intensity ratio of upconverted luminescence peak to the downshifted phosphorescence peak) and the temperature. These TTA upconversion nanomicelles demonstrated excellent thermal sensitivitiy up to 32.56%&#176;C&#8208;1 with outstanding air&#8208;tolerance, and reliability, and reproducibility. Furthermore, we found modifying the annihilators&#8217; chemical structure via introducing hydroxymethyl groups would rule out the interference of the polymer concentration on the thermal sensitivity and stereochemical engineering of annihilators would readily regulate the thermal sensitivity. These upconversion nanomicelles were also successfully applied for thermal imaging of fluids with thermal gradient and in&#8208;situ monitoring of heat dissipation. This work provided a new strategy for designing and modifying TTA upconversion nanomicelles with a higher thermal sensitivity and less interference as ratiometric luminescence nanothermometers for broad potential applications, such as biological thermal imaging, nanomedicine, and micro/nano&#8208;fluidics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacidity of Non&#8208;Planar Boranes: C&#8208;H Bond Activation and Non&#8208;Classical Binding Modes at Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of a geometrically constrained boron Lewis superacid featuring exceptional structure and reactivity is disclosed. It allowed the formation of non&#8208;classical electron deficient B&#8208;H&#8208;B type of bonding which was supported by spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray diffraction parameters as well as computational studies. Taming the pyramidal Lewis acid electrophilicity through weak coordinating anion dissociation enabled a series of highly challenging chemical transformations such as Csp  2  &#8208;H and Csp  3  &#8208;H activation under frustrated Lewis pair regime and the cleavage of Csp  3  &#8208;Si bonds. The demonstration of such type of rich chemical behavior and flexibility on a single molecular compound make it a unique mediator of chemical transformations generally restricted to transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Cascade Synthetic Strategy Toward Structurally Constrained Boron&#8208;doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs) via a cascade reaction from readily available ortho&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4&#8208;boron migration and successive two&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs bearing B&#8208;doped [4]helicene (  1a  &#8208;  1i  ) or BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene (  1n  &#8208;  1t  ) and double [4]helicene (  1u  &#8208;  1v  ) are constructed by this cascade reaction. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy is characterized by modest yields (20&#8208;50%) and broad substrate scope (18 examples) with versatile functional group tolerance. The resultant sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs show good stability under ambient conditions and are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly enough, BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene  1o  forms a unique alternating &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers of enantiomers within a helical columnar superstructure, while BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene  1u  establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking. The synthetic approach reported herein represents a powerful tool for the rapid generation of novel sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs, which are highly attractive for the elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship and for potential optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. A broad range of  &#946;  &#8208;trifluoromethylated carboxylic acid derivatives were prepared in moderate to excellent yields from simple alkenes with excellent regioselectivity. It is noteworthy that ethylene gas, as the simplest olefin, can also be applied directly to obtain  &#946;  &#8208;trifluoromethylated amides and ester. This transformation presents the first example on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;featured Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Trafficking of Protein Delivery and Neuroprotection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delivery of protein into mammalian cells enables the dissection and manipulation of biological process, while this potency is challenged by lacking efficient protein delivery tool and the way to monitor its intracellular trafficking. Herein, we report that the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;featured metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine can generate fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) to deliver protein into neural cells, a hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cell line using conventional strategy. Further, the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature of TPE enabled the fluorescent monitoring of cytosolic protein release. It is found that FSNPs can deliver and release protein into cytosol for subcellular targeting as fast as 18 h post&#8208;delivery. Moreover, the delivery of molecular chaperone DJ&#8208;1 using FSNPs activates MAPK/ERK signaling of neural cells to protect cells from oxidative stress. Together, our strategy provides a powerful tool for neural cell protein delivery and deciphering cell signaling for developing neurodegenerative disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Selective C&#8211;H and C(sp3)&#8211;+P Bond Functionalizations: An Entry to Bioactive Arylated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphonium salts containing C(sp3)&#8211;+P bonds are among the most utilized reagents in organic synthesis for constructing C&#8211;C double bonds. However, their use as C&#8208;selective electrophilic groups is rare. Here, we explore an efficient and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for sequential chemo&#8208; and regioselective C&#8211;H and C(sp3)&#8211;+P bond functionalizations. In the present study, C&#8211;H alkylation resulting in the synthesis of benzhydryl triarylphosphonium salts was achieved by one&#8208;pot, four&#8208;component, cross&#8208;coupling reactions of simple and commercially available starting materials. The utility of the resulting phosphonium salt building blocks was demonstrated by the chemoselective post&#8208;functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;+PPh3 groups to achieve aminations, thiolations, and arylations. In this way, benzhydrylamines, benzhydrylthioethers, and triarylmethanes, structural motifs which feature in many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, are readily accessed. These include the synthesis of two anti&#8208;cancer agents from simple materials in only two to three steps. Additionally, a protocol for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive drugs has been developed using benzhydrylphosphonium salts. This new approach should provide novel transformations for application in both academic and pharmaceutical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Oil&#8210;water&#8210;oil triphase synthesis of ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs) with long&#8208;range ordered and mono&#8208;dispersed ionic groups hold great potential in many advanced applications. Considering the inherent drawbacks of oil&#8208;water biphase method, herein, we explore an oil&#8210;water&#8210;oil triphase method based on phase engineering strategy for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of iCOFNs. The middle water phase serves as a confined reaction region, and the two oil phases are reservoirs for storing and supplying monomers to the water phase. A large aqueous space and low monomer concentration lead to the anisotropic gradual growth of iCOFNs into few&#8208;layer thickness, large lateral size, and high crystallinity. Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra&#8208;high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect&#8208;free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) transmission is a critical challenge in chiroptical research but there are two questions on CPL transmission. How to transfer CPL within intermolecular systems? And can achiral emitters emit CPL? We find the CPL transmission is critically dependent on the resonance transfer, which was attributed to unique circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET).







Abstract
The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. We report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (C&#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore acts as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of C&#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep it far beyond the resonance distance. This C&#8208;FRET mode provides a de&#8197;novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Chuangxinmycin Featuring a Deubiquitinase&#8208;like Sulfurtransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biochemical basis of the sulfur&#8208;incorporation reaction during chuangxinmycin biosynthesis is elucidated. Particularly, the deubiquitinase&#8208;like Cxm3 stands for the first JAMM/MPN+ family protein catalyzing a sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction, instead of the typical amido&#8208;bond hydrolysis reaction, by interacting with a ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG.







Abstract
The knowledge on sulfur incorporation mechanism involved in sulfur&#8208;containing molecule biosynthesis remains limited. Chuangxinmycin is a sulfur&#8208;containing antibiotic with a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2&#8208;cd]indole (TPI) skeleton and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. Despite the previously reported biosynthetic gene clusters and the recent functional characterization of a P450 enzyme responsible for C&#8722;S bond formation, the enzymatic mechanism for sulfur incorporation remains unknown. Here, we resolve this central biosynthetic problem by in vitro biochemical characterization of the key enzymes and reconstitute the TPI skeleton in a one&#8208;pot enzymatic reaction. We reveal that the JAMM/MPN+ protein Cxm3 functions as a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase to catalyze a non&#8208;classical sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction by interacting with the ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG. This finding adds a new mechanism for sulfurtransferase in nature.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Atom Transfer from Phosphaethynolate to an Alkylidyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of sodium phosphaethynolate, Na(OCP), with vanadium alkylidynes is reported. Metathesis of V&#8801;C and P&#8801;C multiple bonds occurs, followed by carbonyl migration to the metal, overall resulting in a direct P&#8208;atom transfer from Na(OCP) to an alkylidyne ligand to yield vanadium&#8208;bound phosphaalkyne complexes.







Abstract
A low&#8208;spin and mononuclear vanadium complex, (Menacnac)V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu) (2) (Menacnac&#8722;=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), was prepared upon treatment of the vanadium neopentylidyne complex (Menacnac)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf) (1) with Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 (diox=1,4&#8208;dioxane), while the isoelectronic ate&#8208;complex [Na(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)]{([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V(CO)(&#951;2&#8208;P&#8801;CtBu)} (4), was obtained via the reaction of Na(OCP)(diox)2.5 and ([ArNC(CH2)]CH[C(CH3)NAr])V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2) (3) in the presence of crown&#8208;ether. Computational studies suggest that the P&#8208;atom transfer proceeds by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of the P&#8801;C bond across the V&#8801;CtBu moiety, followed by a reductive decarbonylation to form the V&#8722;C&#8801;O linkage. The nature of the electronic ground state in diamagnetic complexes, 2 and 4, was further investigated both theoretically and experimentally, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, and comparison of salient bond metrics derived from X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural characterization. In combination, these data are consistent with a low&#8208;valent vanadium ion in complexes 2 and 4. This study represents the first example of a metathesis reaction between the P&#8208;atom of [PCO]&#8722; and an alkylidyne ligand.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old reagent with a new use: Vinyl magnesium bromide, a widely used Grignard reagent, can be oxygenated with O2 to give a magnesium enolate intermediate. This enables a four&#8208;component reaction that efficiently converts chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine into a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step.







Abstract
An O2&#8208;assisted, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize a wide range of syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;I) with O2 (component&#8208;II) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a chiral N&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinyl imine (component&#8208;III) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (component&#8208;IV). The approach allows diastereoselective synthesis of anti/syn&#8208; and syn/syn&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diols in good yields with high diastereoselectivity. The method was illustrated in an efficient, four&#8208;step synthesis of piperidine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;epi&#8208;ethylnorlobelol.

&lt;p&gt;Old reagent with a new use: Vinyl magnesium bromide, a widely used Grignard reagent, can be oxygenated with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give a magnesium enolate intermediate. This enables a four-component reaction that efficiently converts chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butanesulfinyl imine into a wide range of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-1,3-amino alcohols in one step.

         <title>Organic Long Persistent Luminescence Through In Situ Generation of Cuprous(I) Ion Pairs in Ionic Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) system based on in situ generated ionic pairs with CuI centers is proposed and demonstrated. Intermediates are proposed and verified through a series of carefully designed experiments. The afterglow of corresponding blends can last more than 3&#8197;hours, thus this mechanism is the first to incorporate CuI ions in OLPL systems.







Abstract
Recent development of most organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems employed binary or tertiary doping. However, the design strategies towards OLPL materials with hour&#8208;long afterglow duration are still quite limited. Here, we propose a novel OLPL system through melt&#8208;casting method with 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of CuI complexes: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl BINAP&#8208;CuX (X=Cl, Br and I) doped into the triphenylphosphine (TPP) host. The charge separation was initiated prior to excitation through host coordination with CuI complexes, resulting in semi&#8208;free halogen ions and in situ generated CuI cations, which forms TPP + BINAP&#8208;CuX ionic pairs and subsequently ionic solids. The OLPL lifetime can be readily modulated by different halogen atoms and the afterglow can last up to more than 3&#8197;hours perceivable to human eyes. This is a rare example of OLPL initiated through host&#8208;guest coordination that could potentially expand the definition of OLPL systems and design strategies.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Splicing Strategy for Constructing a Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for UDP&#8208;Glucuronosyltransferase 1A1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (HHC) for UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) was developed using a &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy. HHC could be used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals. In addition, it could be used to evaluate the bile excretion function and as a high&#8208;throughput screening tool for the rapid discovery of potential UGT1A1 inhibitors.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for the clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity and on&#8211;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing&#8221; strategy to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, HHC, for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720&#8197;nm after UGT1A1 metabolism. HHC was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function.

         <title>Controlling the Multiple Chiroptical Inversion in Biphasic Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiple chiroptical inversion in Azo biphasic liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) polymers is for the first time realized in&#8197;situ through the tail length modification and degree of polymerization (DP) variation. The amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of three stacking modes, thereby controlling the dynamic reversal of supramolecular chirality.







Abstract
While controlling the chirality and modulating the helicity is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest for gaining a better understanding of the origin of chirality in nature. Herein, structurally similar azobenzene (Azo) vinyl monomers were designed in which the alkyl chains comprised the chiral stereocenter with different achiral tail lengths. Combining the synchronous polymerization, supramolecular stacking and self&#8208;assembly, the multiple chiroptical inversion of the Azo&#8208;polymer supramolecular assemblies can be modulated by the tail length and DP of Azo blocks during in&#8197;situ polymerization. The DP&#8208;, UV light&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, aging time&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties and liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) characterization indicated that the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allow the transcription of intra&#8208;chain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, inter&#8208;chain H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregation, thereby controlling the dynamic multiple reversal of supramolecular chirality.

         <title>A Cooperative OSDA Blueprint for Highly Siliceous Faujasite Zeolite Catalysts with Enhanced Acidity Accessibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative OSDA blueprint for high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites (Si/Al &gt;6) is presented. Only via true cooperation with a crown ether, could trans choline occupy the sod cages of the growing zeolite. Raman&#8208;tracking of the crystallization points to nucleation by the formation of sod&#8208; rather than D6R&#8208; or super&#8208;cages. Reliably low Al&#8208;contents and a unique acidity is thus obtained for a relevant catalytic topology, as validated by plastic waste cracking.







Abstract
A cooperative OSDA strategy is demonstrated, leading to novel high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites with a large potential for disruptive acid catalysis. In bottom&#8208;up synthesis, the symbiosis of choline ion (Ch+) and 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (CE) was evidenced, in a form of full occupation of the sodalite (sod) cages with the trans Ch+ conformer, induced by the CE presence. CE itself occupied the supercages along with additional gauche Ch+, but in synthesis without CE, no trans was found. The cooperation, and thus the fraction of trans Ch+, was closely related to the Si/Al ratio, a key measure for FAU stability and acidity. As such, a bottom&#8208;up handle for lowering the Al&#8208;content of FAU and tuning its acid site distribution is shown. A mechanistic study demonstrated that forming sod cages with trans Ch+ is key to the nucleation of high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites. The materials showed superior performances to commercial FAU zeolites and those synthesized without cooperation, in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene.

         <title>Recovery of the Irreversible Crystallinity of Nanocellulose by Crystallite Fusion: A Strategy for Achieving Efficient Energy Transfers in Sustainable Biopolymer Skeletons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites are coupled into single fusion crystals without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, thermal energy transfer within the CNF aggregate is significantly improved.







Abstract
Crystallites form a grain boundary or the inter&#8208;crystallite interface. A grain boundary is a structural defect that hinders the efficient directional transfer of mechanical stress or thermal phonons in crystal aggregates. We observed that grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites were coupled into single fusion crystals, without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, the lowered crystallinity of CNFs, which has been considered irreversible, was recovered, and the thermal energy transfer in the aggregate was significantly improved. Other nanofibrous crystallites of chitin also showed a similar fusion phenomenon by enhancing the inter&#8208;crystallite interactions. Such crystallite fusion may naturally occur in biological structures with network skeletons of aggregated fibrillar crystallites having mechanical or thermal functions.

         <title>Tunable and Cooperative Catalysis for Enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction with Varied Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilize diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carboxaldehyde and regioisomers in Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. Compatibility was enabled by fine tuning the achiral carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst in the presence of chiral peptidic squaramide. Synthetic utility was demonstrated by stereoselective synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of medicinally related molecules, including U.S. FDA approved drug&#8208; Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein we report an organocatalytic enantioselective functionalization of heterocyclic carboxaldehydes via the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction. Through careful pairing of novel squaramide and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, our method tolerates a breadth of heterocycles, enabling preparation of a series of heterocycle conjugated &#946;&#8208;(tetrahydro)carbolines in good yield and enantioselectivity. Careful selection of carboxylic acid co&#8208;catalyst is essential for toleration of a variety of regioisomeric heterocycles. Utility is demonstrated via the three&#8208;step stereoselective preparation of pyridine&#8208;containing analogues of potent selective estrogen receptor downregulator and U.S. FDA approved drug Tadalafil.

         <title>Stable Interface Chemistry and Multiple Ion Transport of Composite Electrolyte Contribute to Ultra&#8208;long Cycling Solid&#8208;State LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with excellent ion transport capability and stable interface chemistry is developed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability and superior performances of solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/lithium metal batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C. The ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism is identified by solid&#8208;state NMR.







Abstract
Severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and Li metal anode restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which enables the solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries to cycle 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), greatly enhancing its electrochemical stability and suppressing the side reactions. We identify the ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid&#8208;state NMR. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid&#8208;state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Coupling Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Oxidation over Carbon Cloth with Hydrogen Evolution Reaction for Nitrate Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) removal from exhaust is necessary because it presents an environmental concern. Previously reported techniques for NO removal are non&#8208;economical and do not utilize NO waste. NO electrocatalytic oxidation served as the anode substitution reaction. Over a piece of carbon cloth, NO elimination, sustainable nitrate synthesis, and hydrogen production were achieved electrocatalytically.







Abstract
NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and sacrifice of value&#8208;added chemicals. Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as a promising anode substitution reaction to couple with the hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V were applied to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.

         <title>Organic Matrix Assisted Low&#8208;temperature Crystallization of Black Phase Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic matrix can assist the crystallization of all&#8208;organic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point of black phase CsPbX3 perovskite. This low&#8208;temperature crystallization takes place through the formation and decomposition of an intermediate state which is reminiscent of an organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite matrix.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskites have attracted increasing attention for applications in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and optoelectronics, including light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs). Cesium lead halide perovskites with tunable I/Br ratios and a band gap aligning with the sunlight region are promising candidates for PSCs. Although impressive progress has been made to improve device efficiency from the initial 2.9&#8201;% with low phase stability to over 20&#8201;% with high stability, there are still questions regarding the perovskite crystal growth mechanism, especially at low temperatures. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in using an organic matrix, including the addition and use of organic ions, polymers, and solvent molecules, for the crystallization of black phase inorganic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point. We also discuss possible mechanisms for this low&#8208;temperature crystallization and their effect on the stability of black phase perovskites. We conclude with an outlook and perspective for further fabrication of large&#8208;scale inorganic perovskites for optoelectronic applications.

We conclude with an outlook and perspective for further fabrication of large-scale inorganic perovskites for optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Location&#8208;Dependent Lanthanide Selectivity Engineered into Structurally Characterized Designed Coiled Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Location&#8208;dependent size selectivity can be programmed into designed metallo coiled coils, allowing for the generation of near&#8208;identical selective and promiscuous metal&#8208;ion sites. The first crystal structure of a lanthanide bound within a coiled coil, reveal that the existence of an optimal radius stems from the structural constraints of the peptide scaffold. Therefore, a selective site can in principle be designed de novo for any given Ln3+ ion.







Abstract
Herein we report unprecedented location&#8208;dependent, size&#8208;selective binding to designed lanthanide (Ln3+) sites within miniature protein coiled coil scaffolds. Not only do these engineered sites display unusual Ln3+ selectivity for moderately large Ln3+ ions (Nd to Tb), for the first time we demonstrate that selectivity can be location&#8208;dependent and can be programmed into the sequence. A 1&#8197;nm linear translation of the binding site towards the N&#8208;terminus can convert a selective site into a highly promiscuous one. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure, the first of a lanthanide binding site within a coiled coil to be reported, coupled with CD studies, reveal the existence of an optimal radius that likely stems from the structural constraints of the coiled coil scaffold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location&#8208;dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location&#8208;dependent Ln3+ selectivity within a protein.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two biantennary N&#8208;glycans with asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialic acid groups were synthesized through a convergent approach that also enabled the first chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan (see scheme). The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of a fully sialylated tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is protected as NAc2 to improve reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylation to the branched mannose in an ether solvent, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylation reactions was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium labeled sialyl N&#8208;glycans were also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized N&#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated N&#8208;glycans revealed a difference in the recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary N&#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effects of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.

         <title>Reversible Dissociation of a Dialumene**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly trans&#8208;bent dialumene has marginal Al=Al double&#8208;bond character and, in solution, can dissociate into monomeric aluminyl fragments. Reactivity studies reveal that both the dialuminene and aluminyl monomer can be trapped by varying the reaction partner. DFT calculations elaborate the origins of the extreme trans&#8208;bending, weak Al=Al bond, and define substituent effects in dialumenes.







Abstract
Dialumenes are neutral AlI compounds with Al=Al multiple bonds. We report the isolation of an amidophosphine&#8208;supported dialumene. Our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational DFT analyses reveal a long and extreme trans&#8208;bent Al=Al bond with a low dissociation energy and bond order. In solution, the dialumene can dissociate into monomeric AlI species. Reactivity studies reveal two modes of reaction: as dialumene or as aluminyl monomers.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Lewis Base&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Umpolung Reactions of Cyclopentadienones and Tropone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclosed the carbonates of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones could form &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium&#8208;based 1,2&#8208;carbodipoles, which would isomerize to interesting &#951;  2  &#8208;Pd(0)&#8208;cyclopentadienone complexes. Compared with the labile parent cyclopentadienone, the HOMO&#8208;energy of the related &#951;  2  &#8208;complex was significantly raised via the back&#8208;bonding of Pd(0) as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis base, rendering the uncoordinated C=C bond as an electron&#8208;richer dienophile in inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;type reaction with diverse 1&#8208;azadienes. The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imines)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re&#8208;generated &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species. New C  1  &#8208;symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides, tropone could be similarly activated by a Pd(0) complex.</dc:description>

The vinylogous (aza)Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman or cross Rauhut&#8211;Currier addition to (imines)carbonyls or activated alkenes, respectively, was also realized to afford chiral [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadducts, respectively, after trapping the re-generated &#960;-allylpalladium species. New C  1  -symmetric ligands from simple chiral sources were developed, exhibiting high stereoselectivity even with racemic substrates via an unusual dynamic kinetic resolution process. Besides, tropone could be similarly activated by a Pd(0) complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd/FER vs Pd/SSZ&#8208;13 Passive NOx Adsorbers: Adsorbate&#8208;controlled Location of Atomically Dispersed Pd(II) in FER Determines High Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;loaded FER and SSZ&#8208;13 zeolites as low&#8208;temperature passive NOx adsorbers (PNA) are compared under practical conditions. Vehicle cold&#8208;start exposes the material to CO under a range of concentrations, necessitating a systematic exploration of the effect of CO on the performance of isolated Pd ions in PNA. NO release temperature of both adsorbers decreases gradually with the increase of CO concentration from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm. This beneficial effect results from local nano&#8208;&#8220;hot spot&#8221; formation during CO oxidation. Dissimilar to Pd/SSZ&#8208;13, increasing the CO concentration above ~1,000 ppm improves the NOx storage significantly for Pd/FER, attributed to the presence of Pd ions in FER &#947;&#8208;site that is shielded from NOx. CO mobilizes this Pd atom to the NOx accessible position where it becomes active for PNA. This behavior explains the very high resistance of Pd/FER to hydrothermal aging: Pd/FER materials survive hydrothermal aging at 8000C in 10% H2O vapor for 16 hours with no deterioration in NOx uptake/release behavior. Thus, by allocating Pd ions to the specific microporous pockets in FER, we have produced (hydro)thermally stable and active PNA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Innovative Approach for the Generation of Species of the Interstellar Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser ablation of solid organic compounds with high melting points is proposed for the in situ generation of new chemical species. Diaminomaleonitrile is used as a prototypical precursor, generating numerous interstellar compounds and aminocyanoacetylene for the first time. This experimental method could open the doors towards the discoveries of unsuspected molecules in space.







Abstract
The large amount of unstable species in the realm of interstellar chemistry drives an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the in situ generations of molecules that enable their spectroscopic characterizations. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to decode the molecular universe by matching the interstellar and terrestrial spectra. We propose an approach based on laser ablation of nonvolatile solid organic precursors. The generated chemical species are cooled in a supersonic expansion and probed by high&#8208;resolution microwave spectroscopy. We present a proof of concept through a simultaneous formation of interstellar compounds and the first generation of aminocyanoacetylene using diaminomaleonitrile as a prototypical precursor. With this micro&#8208;laboratory, we open the door to generation of unsuspected species using precursors not typically accessible to traditional techniques such as electric discharge and pyrolysis.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented thiiranation controlled by chiral dirhodium catalysts combined with a highly stereospecific thiirane reduction render the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination a stereoselective process (see scheme). The fourfold stereogenicity of pertinent overcrowded alkenes was thereby tractable with divergent stereocontrol, thus enabling access to all four stereoisomers from identical substrates.







Abstract
Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules owing to their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors, while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and with chiral auxiliaries. Herein we report that direct catalyst control is achieved by a stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination with enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol for various bistricyclic aromatic enes. Using Rh2(S&#8208;PTAD)4 as catalyst, several diazo compounds were selectively coupled with a thioketone to give one of the four anti&#8208;folded overcrowded alkene stereoisomers upon reduction. Complete stereodivergence was reached by catalyst control in combination with distinct thiirane reductions to provide all four stereoisomers with e.r. values of up to 99:1. We envision that this strategy will enable the synthesis of topologically unique overcrowded alkenes for functional materials, catalysis, energy&#8208; and electron transfer, and bioactive compounds.

         <title>Photoinduced Trifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Catalyzed by High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes with simple naphthyridine ligands undergo facile aerobic oxidation to stable, isolated NiIII organometallic complexes, in which Ni&#8211;CF3 bond homolysis is observed upon irradiation with blue LED light. These complexes catalyze photoinduced C&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation in arenes and heteroarenes.







Abstract
We describe a series of air&#8208;stable NiIII complexes supported by a simple, robust naphthyridine&#8208;based ligand. Access to the high&#8208;valent oxidation state is enabled by the CF3 ligands on the nickel, while the naphthyridine exhibits either a monodentate or bidentate coordination mode that depends on the oxidation state and sterics, and enables facile aerobic oxidation of NiII to NiIII. These NiIII complexes act as efficient catalysts for photoinduced C(sp2)&#8722;H bond trifluoromethylation reactions of (hetero)arenes using versatile synthetic protocols. This blue LED light&#8208;mediated catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical pathway and demonstrates potential in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogs.

Fast and ultrasensitive detection of pathogens is very important for efficient monitoring and prevention of viral infections. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free optical detection approach that uses a printed nanochain assay for colorimetric quantitative testing of viruses. The antibody&#8208;modified nanochains have high activity and specificity which can rapidly identify target viruses directly from biofluids in 15&#8194;min, as well as differentiate their subtypes. Arising from the resonance induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the color of nanochains changes with the binding of viruses that are easily observed by a smartphone. We achieve the detection limit of 1&#8197;PFU&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1 through optimizing the optical response of nanochains in visible region. Besides, it allows for real&#8208;time response to virus concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0&#215;105&#8197;PFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. This low&#8208;cost and portable platform is also applicable to rapid detection of other biomarkers, making it attractive for many clinical applications.

         <title>The Archetypal Homoleptic Lanthanide Quadruple&#8208;Decker&#8212;Synthesis, Mechanistic Studies, and Quantum Chemical Investigations</title>

The synthesis of the first well&#8208;defined neutral and homoleptic (same metal, same ligand) all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based quadruple&#8208;decker complexes [SmIII/II/III3(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6)) along with other unique sandwich complexes is shown.







Abstract
Reduction of [SmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)(BH4)(thf)] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) with KC8 resulted in [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4], the first example of a homoleptic lanthanide quadruple&#8208;decker. As indicated by an analysis of the bond metrics in the solid&#8208;state, the inner Sm ion is present in the divalent oxidation state, while the outer ones are trivalent. This observation could be confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Mechanistic studies revealed not only insight into possible formation pathways of [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] but also resulted in the transformation to other mixed metal sandwich complexes with unique structural properties. These are the 1D&#8208;polymeric chain structured [KSmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)]n and the hexametallic species [(tol)K(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)SmII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)K]2 which were initially envisioned as possible building blocks as part of different retrosynthetically guided pathways that we developed.

         <title>An Overlooked Natural Hydrogen Evolution Pathway: Ni2+ Boosting H2O Reduction by Fe(OH)2 Oxidation during Low&#8208;Temperature Serpentinization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient natural H2 production during Lt&#8208;serpentinization through water reduction by Fe(OH)2 oxidation has been experimentally identified for the first time. This finding provides a new insight to explore the natural H2, which originated from the Ni2+ rich ultramafic rocks.







Abstract
Natural hydrogen (H2) has gained considerable attentions as a renewable energy resource to mitigate the globally increasing environmental concerns. Low&#8208;temperature serpentinization (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) as a typical water&#8211;rock reaction is a major source of the natural H2. However, the reaction mechanism and the controlling step to product H2 remained unclear, which hinders the further utilization of natural H2. Herein, we demonstrated that the H2 production rate could be determined by the Fe(OH)2 oxidation during low&#8208;temperature serpentinization. Moreover, the co&#8208;existence of Ni2+ could largely enhance the H2 production kinetics. With the addition of only 1&#8201;% Ni2+, the H2 production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90&#8201;&#176;C. D2O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H2 production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni2+ to promote the reduction of H2O.

         <title>Ring Expansion Fluorination of Unactivated Cyclopropanes Mediated by a New Monofluoroiodane(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for C&#8722;C bond cleavage and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes has been developed. The reaction consists of C&#8722;C bond scission and ring expansion fluorination, which are both promoted by a novel hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent&#8197;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new strategy for carbon&#8722;carbon bond scission and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes, which was accomplished with a new hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent 1. This novel method delivers medicinally relevant 4&#8208;fully substituted fluoropiperidines in moderate to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Reagent 1, which has an N&#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, was readily synthesized via three steps in 76&#8201;% overall yield and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Owing to the presence of a secondary I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonding interaction between the &#955;3&#8208;iodane atom and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the N&#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, 1 has excellent stability and can be stored at ambient temperature for 6&#8197;months without any detectable decomposition. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate that readily combines with a fluoride ion to generate the product.

         <title>Insight on the Order of Regioselective Ultrafast Formation of Disulfide Bonds in (Antimicrobial) Peptides and Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective palladium catalysis used for the regioselective ultrafast synthesis of peptides and proteins bearing multiple disulfide bonds provided important insight into the order of oxidation (see picture). The approach, which produced a novel antimicrobial plectasin derivative with enhanced antibiotic activity relative to that of the natural product, should enable the practical synthesis of peptide/protein libraries for various applications.







Abstract
Disulfide&#8208;rich peptides and proteins are among the most fascinating bioactive molecules. The difficulties associated with the preparation of these targets have prompted the development of various chemical strategies. Nevertheless, the production of these targets remains very challenging or elusive. Recently, we introduced a strategy for one&#8208;pot disulfide bond formation, tackling most of the previous limitations. However, the effect of the order of oxidation remained an underexplored issue. Herein we report on the complete synthetic flexibility of the approach with respect to the order of oxidation of three disulfide bonds in targets that lack the knot motif. In contrast, our study reveals an essential order of disulfide bond formation in the EETI&#8208;II knotted miniprotein. This synthetic strategy was applied for the synthesis of novel analogues of the plectasin antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a notorious human pathogen.

Nevertheless, the production of these targets remains very challenging or elusive. Recently, we introduced a strategy for one-pot disulfide bond formation, tackling most of the previous limitations. However, the effect of the order of oxidation remained an underexplored issue. Herein we report on the complete synthetic flexibility of the approach with respect to the order of oxidation of three disulfide bonds in targets that lack the knot motif. In contrast, our study reveals an essential order of disulfide bond formation in the EETI-II knotted miniprotein. This synthetic strategy was applied for the synthesis of novel analogues of the plectasin antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), a notorious human pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Commercial Cu2Cr2O5 Decorated with Iron Carbide Nanoparticles as Multifunctional Catalyst for Magnetically Induced Continuous Flow Hydrogenation of Aromatic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial copper chromite is decorated with iron carbide nanoparticles using a simple and versatile method, producing a magnetically activable multifunctional catalytic system. This system (ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  ) is able to reduce aromatic ketones to aromatic alcohols when exposed to a high frequency alternating current magnetic field,  i.e.  magnetic induction. Under magnetic excitation, the ICNPs generate locally confined hot spots, activating selectively the Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  surface while the global temperature of the reaction mixture remains low (~ 80&#176;C). The ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  catalyst selectively hydrogenates a scope of benzylic and non&#8208;benzylic ketones under these mild conditions (3 bar H  2  , heptane), while ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  or Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  are inactive when the same global temperature is adjusted by conventional heating. A flow reactor is presented allowing the combined use of magnetic induction for continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation at elevated pressure. The excellent catalytic properties of ICNPs@Cu  2  Cr  2  O  5  for the hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfuralacetone are conserved for at least 17 hours on stream, demonstrating for the first time the application of a magnetically heated catalyst to a continuously operated hydrogenation reaction in the liquid phase. The reported approach for the decoration of solid materials with magnetically activated nanoparticles may be applied to a wide range of heterogeneous catalysts, generalizing the access to potential advantages associated with magnetic induction in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Mediated N2&#8208;Splitting and Functionalization in the Presence of a Coordinated Alkyne</title>

         <dc:description>A new [PCCP]&#8208;coordinated molybdenum platform com&#173;pris&#173;ing a coordinated alkyne was employed for the cleavage of molecular di&#173;nitrogen. The coordinated  &#414;  2  &#8208;alkyne was left unaffected during this re&#173;duction.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Peptide Dendrimer Inspired from Glatiramer Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a random polypeptide drug used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. With the aim of identifying a precisely defined alternative to GA, we synthesized a library of peptide dendrimers with an amino acid composition similar to GA. We then challenged the dendrimers to trigger the release of the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;1 receptor antagonist (IL&#8208;1Ra) from human monocytes, which is one of the effects of GA on immune cells. Several of the largest dendrimers tested were as active as GA. Detailed profiling of the best hit showed that this dendrimer induces the differentiation of monocytes towards an M2 (anti&#8208;inflammatory) state as GA does, however with a distinct immune marker profile. Our peptide dendrimer might serve as starting point to develop a well&#8208;defined immunomodulatory analog of GA.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Substitution with Copper(I) Homoenolates Generated from Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using copper(I) homoenolates as nucleophiles, which are generated through the ring&#8208;opening of 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols, a catalytic asymmetric allylic substitution with allyl phosphates is achieved in high to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Both 1&#8208;substituted cyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;ols and allylic phosphates enjoy broad substrate scopes. Remarkably, various functional groups, such as ether, ester, tosylate, imide, alcohol, nitro, and carbamate are well tolerated. Moreover, the present method is nicely extended to the asymmetric construction of quaternary carbon centers. Some control experiments argue against a radical&#8208;based reaction mechanism and a catalytic cycle based on a two&#8208;electron process is proposed. Finally, the synthetic utilities of the product are showcased by means of the transformations of the terminal olefin group and the ketone group.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore&#8208;Bound Water at the Key Residue Histidine&#8197;37 in Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water structure impacts biological processes. Within the Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2 proton channel, a bound water molecule proton was detected at a chemical shift of 11&#8197;ppm. Combining magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and quantum chemical calculations, the water was found hydrogen bonded to N&#948;1 of the functional histidine&#8197;37 residue.







Abstract
Atomic details of structured water molecules are indispensable to understand the thermodynamics of important biological processes including the proton conduction mechanism of the M2 protein. Despite the expectation of structured water molecules based on crystal structures of Influenza&#8197;A&#8197;M2, only two water populations have been observed by NMR in reconstituted lipid bilayer samples. These are the bulk&#8208; and lipid&#8208;associated water populations typically seen in membrane samples. Here, we detect a bound water molecule at a chemical shift of 11&#8197;ppm, located near the functional histidine&#8197;37 residue in the M2 conductance domain, which comprises residues 18 to 60. Combining 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and density functional theory calculations, we show that the bound water forms a hydrogen bond to the &#948;1 nitrogen of histidine&#8197;37.

         <title>Electron Localization and Lattice Strain Induced by Surface Lithium Doping Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Formate from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value&#8208;added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped tin (s&#8208;SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus leading to both the activity and selectivity enhancement of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s&#8208;SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate performances, including a partial current density of &#8722;1.0 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92%. Furthermore, Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &gt; 800 cycles. Our work suggests an efficient approach to incorporate the electron localization and lattice strain as the active catalytic sites to synergistically achieve highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value-added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface-lithium-doped tin (s-SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus leading to both the activity and selectivity enhancement of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s-SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2-to-formate performances, including a partial current density of &#8722;1.0 A&#183;cm-2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92%. Furthermore, Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries equipped with the s-SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &amp;gt; 800 cycles. Our work suggests an efficient approach to incorporate the electron localization and lattice strain as the active catalytic sites to synergistically achieve highly efficient CO2-to-formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Glutarimides: Alternative Cereblon Binders for the Design of PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting cereblon (CRBN) is currently one of the most frequently reported proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) approaches, owing to favorable drug&#8208;like properties of CRBN ligands, immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs). However, IMiDs are known to be inherently unstable, readily undergoing hydrolysis in body fluids. Here we show that IMiDs and IMiD&#8208;based PROTACs rapidly hydrolyze in commonly utilized cell media, which significantly affects their cell efficacy. We designed novel CRBN binders, phenyl glutarimide (PG) analogues, and showed that they retained affinity for CRBN with high ligand efficiency (LE &gt;0.48) and displayed improved chemical stability. Our efforts led to the discovery of PG PROTAC  4c  (SJ995973), a uniquely potent degrader of bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal (BET) proteins that inhibited the viability of human acute myeloid leukemia MV4&#8208;11 cells at low picomolar concentrations (IC  50  = 3 pM; BRD4 DC  50  = 0.87 nM). These findings strongly support the utility of PG derivatives in the design of CRBN&#8208;directed PROTACs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;&#8208;Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N&#8208;aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene 2b. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of 2b towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes 3&#8208;6 with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the Al center in 2b can behave as: 1. a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; 2. a &#963;&#8208;donating, &#963;&#8208;accepting and &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; and 3. a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#963;&#8208;accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of 2b with IDippCuCl (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu&#8208;alumanyl complex 8. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Piezocatalysis: Energy Band Theory or Screening Charge Effect?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezocatalysis, a new&#8208;emerging catalysis technology relying on catalyst&#8217;s piezopotential and piezoelectric property, is attracting unprecedented research enthusiasm for applications in energy conversion, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism for piezocatalysis is still in debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles should be enhanced to further advance this technology for future piezocatalysts design and system optimization. In this article, we review the two popular theories to explain the observed piezocatalysis in terms of the energy band theory and the screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the difference, relevance, evidence and contradiction of the two mechanisms is provided. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of the future mechanic study are put forward. Hopefully, this review can help readers to gain a better understanding and to start quickly in applying piezocatalysis to their own research.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Semisynthesis of Lipidated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipidation is a ubiquitous modification of peptides and proteins that can occur either co&#8208; or post&#8208;translationally. An array of different lipid classes can adorn proteins and has been shown to influence a number of crucial biological activities, including the regulation of signaling, cell&#8208;cell adhesion events, and the anchoring of proteins to lipid rafts and phospholipid membranes. Lipid modifications discovered to date include prenylation, such as  S  &#8208;farnesylation and  S  &#8208;geranylgeranylation,  S  &#8208; and  N  &#8208;palmitoylation,  N  &#8209;myristoylation, as well as the attachment of cholesterol, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) anchors to the C&#8208;terminus of proteins. While nature employs a range of enzymes to install lipid modifications onto proteins, the use of these for chemoenzymatic generation of lipidated proteins is often inefficient or impractical. An alternative is to harness the power of modern synthetic and semisynthetic technologies to access lipid&#8208;modified proteins in pure and homogeneously modified form. This review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of lipidation and ligation chemistry and their implementation in the synthesis and semisynthesis of homogeneously lipidated proteins that have enabled the influence of these modifications on protein structure and function to be uncovered.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for Inhibition of ROS&#8208;Producing Respiratory Complex I by NADH&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nM concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR failed. Here, we report by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis the structure of NADH&#8208;OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0 &#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues specific and essential for binding NADH&#8208;OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH&#8208;OH towards the unique Rossmann&#8208;fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role for mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH&#8208;OH displays a lead&#8208;structure for synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.</dc:description>

We have identified key amino acid residues specific and essential for binding NADH-OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH-OH towards the unique Rossmann-fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role for mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH-OH displays a lead-structure for synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Cu&#8208;Doped SnO2&#8208;NiO p&#8208;n Heterostructure That Shows Significant Raman Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on chemical mechanism (CM) attracts tremendous attention for great selectivity and stability. However, low enhancement factor (EF) limits its practical applications for trace detection. Here, a novel sponge&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doping SnO2  &#8208;NiO p&#8208;n semiconductor heterostructure (SnO2  &#8208;NiOx/Cu), was first created as a CM&#8208;based SERS substrate with a significant EF of 1.46 &#215; 1010  . This remarkable EF was mainly attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;separation efficacy of p&#8208;n heterojunction and charge transfer resonance resulted from Cu doping. Moreover, the porous structure enriched the probe molecules, resulting in further SERS signals magnification. By immobilizing CuPc as an inner&#8208;reference element, SnO2  &#8208;NiOx/Cu was developed as a SERS nose for selective recognition of multiple lung cancer related VOCs down to ppb level. The information of VOCs was recorded in a barcode, demonstrating practical potential of a desktop SERS device for biomarker screening.</dc:description>

         <title>High Density Polyethylenes Bearing Isolated In&#8208;Chain Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene materials are highly important polymers which are produced in the largest volume among all plastics. Due to the chemical inert property of saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the degradation of polyethylene is extremely challenging, which prevents them from efficient chemical recycling. Installing functional groups in the main chain of polyethylenes may facilitate the degradation and following chemical recycling of polyethylene materials. Here we report a highly selective approach for the synthesis of high density polyethylenes bearing low content isolated in&#8208;chain carbonyls. Linear high&#8208;molecular weight polyethylene chains are synthesized via the palladium catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with metal carbonyls. Different from traditional ethylene/CO copolymerization reactions, excellent non&#8208;alternating selectivity has been achieved. While the properties of polyethylene have been retained in the copolymer, faster degradation compared with that of polyethylene was observed upon UV light irradiation. The synthesized materials may therefore serve as more environmentally friendly alternative plastics than traditional polyethylene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Splitting by a C60 Supported Single Vanadium Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60  supported vanadium atom, C60V+  + H2O &#8594; C60VO+  + H2  . We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+  , and observe the formation of H2  as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60  &#8208;supported V+  , whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+  ion by a high energy barrier. The C60  support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70 kJ/mol due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60  support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60  &#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determination of the solution conformation of both small organic molecules and peptides in water remains a substantial hurdle in using NMR solution conformations to guide drug design due to the lack of easy to use alignment media. Herein we report the design of a flexible compressible chemically cross&#8208;linked poly&#8208;4&#8208;acrylomorpholine gel that can be used for the alignment of both small molecules and cyclic peptides in water. To test the new gel, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and  J  &#8208;coupling constants were used in the configurational analysis of strychnine hydrochloride, a molecule that has been studied extensively in organic solvents as well as a small cyclic peptide that is known to form an a&#8208;helix in water. The conformational ensembles for each molecule with the best fit to the data are reported. Identification of minor conformers in water that cannot easily be determined by conventional NOE measurements will facilitate the use of RDC experiments in structure&#8208;based drug design.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Vaccine Dynamics with Quantum Dots for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visualization of spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines is achieved with synthetic QDs for potent immune activation.







Abstract
The direct visualization of vaccine fate is important to investigate its immunoactivation process to elucidate the detailed molecular reaction process at single&#8208;molecular level. Yet, visualization of the spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines remains poorly explored. Here, we show that quantum dot (QD) nanomaterials allow for monitoring vaccine dynamics and for amplified immune response. Synthetic QDs enable efficient conjugation of antigen and adjuvants to target tissues and cells, and non&#8208;invasive imaging the trafficking dynamics to lymph nodes and cellular compartments. The nanoparticle vaccine elicits potent immune responses and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. The synthetic QDs showed high fluorescence quantum yield and superior photostability, and the reliable and long&#8208;term spatiotemporal tracking of vaccine dynamics was realized for the first time by using the synthetic QDs, providing a powerful strategy for studying immune response and evaluating vaccine efficacy.

The synthetic QDs showed high fluorescence quantum yield and superior photostability, and the reliable and long-term spatiotemporal tracking of vaccine dynamics was realized for the first time by using the synthetic QDs, providing a powerful strategy for studying immune response and evaluating vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation with Humic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Supported Electron&#8208;Deficient Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A humic&#8208;acid&#8208;based carbonaceous support material AHA_U_400 was prepared through mild thermal condensation and cross&#8208;linking between artificial humic acid and urea, and the material proved to enable the preparation of the stable Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt1@AHA_U_400). Pt was coordinated to two unsaturated O atoms, as well as one Cl&#8722; and one HCl moiety.







Abstract
The hydrosilylation reaction is one of the largest&#8208;scale applications of homogeneous catalysis, and Pt homogeneous catalysts have been widely used in this reaction for the commercial manufacture of silicon products. However, homogeneous Pt catalysts result in considerable problems, such as undesired side reactions, unacceptable catalyst residues and disposable platinum consumption. Here, we synthesized electron&#8208;deficient Pt single atoms supported on humic matter (Pt1@AHA_U_400), and the catalyst was used in hydrosilylation reactions, which showed super activity (turnover frequency as high as 3.0&#215;107&#8197;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high performance of the catalyst results from the atomic dispersion of Pt and the electron deficiency of the Pt1 atoms, which is different from conventional Pt nanoscale catalysts. Excellent performance is maintained during recycle experiments, indicating the high stability of the catalyst.

         <title>Dirhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective B&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;Diaryl Carbenes: Efficient Access to gem&#8208;Diarylmethine Boranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14&#8201;300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The scarcity of reliable methods for synthesizing chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borons limits their applications. Herein, we report a method for highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral gem&#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14&#8201;300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance. The borane compounds synthesized by this method could be efficiently transformed into diaryl methanol, diaryl methyl amine, and triaryl methane derivatives with good stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies suggested that the borane adduct coordinated to the rhodium catalyst and thus interfered with decomposition of the diazomethane, and that insertion of a rhodium carbene (generated from the diaryl diazomethane) into the B&#8722;H bond was most likely the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aza&#8208;Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling To Form Ynimines: Development and Application to the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ynimines that are usually difficult to access were readily prepared from simple starting materials under Cu catalysis. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation was subsequently developed for the synthesis of aza&#8208;heterocycles, such as isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines (see scheme).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;substituted alkynes, such as ynamines and ynamides, are versatile synthetic building blocks. Ynimines bearing additional nucleophilic and electrophilic centers relative to ynamines and ynamides are expected to have high synthetic potential. However, their chemical reactivity remains unexplored owing mainly to the lack of synthetic accessibility. We report herein a versatile copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ynimines from readily available O&#8208;acetyl ketoximes and terminal alkynes. A wide range of O&#8208;acetyl ketoximes derived from diaryl ketones, aryl alkyl ketones and dialkyl ketones underwent cross&#8208;coupling with a diverse set of terminal alkynes to afford the ynimines in good to excellent yields. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation reaction exploiting the reactivity of the ynimine generated in situ was subsequently developed for the synthesis of medicinally important heterocycles, including isoquinolines, azaindoles, azabenzofurans, azabenzothiophenes and carbolines.

         <title>Metathesis Cascade&#8208;Triggered Depolymerization of Enyne Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are developed to enable cascade depolymerization triggered by metathesis catalysts. Stable in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, and at elevated temperatures, these enyne SIPs can undergo efficient depolymerization in response to external stimuli. This work established a general approach to stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of controlled release of heterocyclic reagents.







Abstract
A novel class of enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) capable of metathesis cascade&#8208;triggered depolymerization is reported. Studies on model compounds established 1,6&#8208;enyne structures for efficient metathesis cascade reactions. SIPs incorporating the optimized 1,6&#8208;enyne motif were prepared via both polycondensation and iterative exponential growth approaches. These SIPs demonstrated excellent stability in strong acid, base, nucleophiles, or at elevated temperatures, and can undergo efficient and complete depolymerization once triggered by a metathesis catalyst. Further studies revealed that introducing a terminal alkene to the chain end of the enyne SIPs improved the depolymerization efficiency, and established their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Microscale Interfacial Polymerization on a Chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEG&#8208;based hydrogels can be precisely localized in capillary&#8208;driven microfluidic chips by in situ interfacial polymerization. This allows using hydrogels for filtration, studying diffusion processes of solutes across the hydrogels and rapid bioassays.







Abstract
Forming hydrogels with precise geometries is challenging and mostly done using photopolymerization, which involves toxic chemicals, rinsing steps, solvents, and bulky optical equipment. Here, we introduce a new method for in situ formation of hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined geometry in a sealed microfluidic chip by interfacial polymerization. The geometry of the hydrogel is programmed by microfluidic design using capillary pinning structures and bringing into contact solutions containing hydrogel precursors from vicinal channels. The characteristics of the hydrogel (mesh size, molecular weight cut&#8208;off) can be readily adjusted. This method is compatible with capillary&#8208;driven microfluidics, fast, uses small volumes of reagents and samples, and does not require specific laboratory equipment. Our approach creates opportunities for filtration, hydrogel functionalization, and hydrogel&#8208;based assays, as exemplified by a rapid, compact competitive immunoassay that does not require a rinsing step.

         <title>General, Metal&#8208;free Synthesis of Carbon Nanofiber Assemblies from Plant Oils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanofibers can be conveniently prepared from plant oils in the presence of P2O5, using long&#8208;neglected Staudinger carbene chemistry. The fibers are shown to be electronically highly conductive and are exemplarily used for capacitive deionization.







Abstract
We designed a metal&#8208;free synthesis of carbon nanofiber based on ketene chemistry using phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and vegetable oil. Based on the characterization of intermediates, P2O5&#8208;oil reaction yielded most possibly alkylketenes, which polymerized into poly(ketene) with abundant enol groups. The enol groups further reacted with P2O5, forcing the poly(ketene) to assemble into a nano&#8208;sized preassembly structure. Moderate heating transforms these structures into carbonaceaus nanofibers. This approach is applicable to other chemicals with similar structure to vegetable oil. The carbon nanofibers with P&#8208;O&#8208;C functionalization show relatively high graphitization degree and promising textural properties. The C&#8208;O&#8208;P environment accounts for 66&#8197;at&#8201;% of the total P and creates a superior thermal stability. As a model application, a CDI system built of a carbon&#8208;nanofiber&#8208;based electrode countered by an activated carbon&#8208;based electrode exhibited exceptional performance.

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclopropanations via Enzyme&#8208;Bound Iminium Ion Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a promiscuous 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) resulted in an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme that promotes the stereoselective addition of diethyl 2&#8208;chloromalonate to substituted cinnamaldehydes to afford various cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity.







Abstract
Cyclopropane rings are an important structural motif frequently found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. Commonly, biocatalytic methodologies for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropanes rely on repurposed or artificial heme enzymes. Here, we engineered an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme based on a promiscuous tautomerase for the enantioselective synthesis of various cyclopropanes via the nucleophilic addition of diethyl 2&#8208;chloromalonate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The engineered enzyme promotes formation of the two new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds with excellent stereocontrol over both stereocenters, affording the desired cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity (d.r. up to 25:1; e.r. up to 99:1). Our results highlight the usefulness of promiscuous enzymes for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Guanosine Tetra&#8208; and Pentaphosphate (p)ppGpp with RNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Sensors**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically encodable fluorescent RNA sensors are engineered to detect (p)ppGpp in live cells. Under nutrient starvation, cells produce and accumulate (p)ppGpp as a response, which can now be observed using these sensors.







Abstract
Guanosine tetra&#8208; and pentaphosphate, (p)ppGpp, are important alarmone nucleotides that regulate bacterial survival in stressful environment. A direct detection of (p)ppGpp in living cells is critical for our understanding of the mechanism of bacterial stringent response. However, it is still challenging to image cellular (p)ppGpp. Here, we report RNA&#8208;based fluorescent sensors for the live&#8208;cell imaging of (p)ppGpp. Our sensors are engineered by conjugating a recently identified (p)ppGpp&#8208;specific riboswitch with a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, Broccoli. These sensors can be genetically encoded and enable direct monitoring of cellular (p)ppGpp accumulation. Unprecedented information on cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variation and cellular dynamics of (p)ppGpp levels is now obtained under different nutritional conditions. These RNA&#8208;based sensors can be broadly adapted to study bacterial stringent response.

         <title>Lewis Pair Catalyzed Regioselective Polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;Alkyl Sorbates for the Synthesis of (AB)n Sequenced Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis pairs were applied for living/controlled and 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of sustainable (E,E)&#8208;alkyl sorbates. Poly((E,E)&#8208;alkyl sorbates) could be further converted into various polymers with strict (AB)n sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene).







Abstract
In this contribution, Lewis pairs (LPs) composed of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) with different steric hindrance and nucleophilicity as Lewis bases (LBs) and Al&#8208;based compounds with comparable acidity but different steric hindrance as Lewis acids (LAs) were applied for 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;methyl sorbate (MS) and (E,E)&#8208;ethyl sorbate (ES). The effects of steric hindrance, electron&#8208;donating ability, and acidity of LPs on MS and ES polymerization were systematically investigated. High catalytic activity and high initiation efficiency can be achieved, leading to the formation of PMS with 100&#8201;% 1,4&#8208;selectivity, tunable molecular weight (Mw up to 333&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD). Block copolymerization of ES and methyl methacrylate (MMA) was also realized. Meanwhile, this system can be applied to other homologous conjugated diene substrates. Furthermore, simple chemical reactions can efficiently convert PMS to different polymers with strict (AB)n sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol), and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene).

         <title>Distorted Sandwich &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII Catalyst: Linear Polyethylene and Synthesis of Ethylene/Acrylate Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distorted sandwich &#945;&#8208;diimine PdII catalysts with m&#8208;xylyl groups for axial shielding of the metal center provide living polymerization of linear polyethylene with low branching to be turned into either hard plastics or thermoplastic elastomers incorporating a range of acrylates in a one&#8208;pot by metal&#8208;organic insertion light&#8208;initiated polymerization.







Abstract
The introduction of m&#8208;xylyl substituents to &#945;&#8208;diimine PdII catalyst promotes living ethylene polymerization at room temperature and low pressure to yield high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) with low branching (&lt;17/1000&#8197;C). m&#8208;Xylyl groups provide a highly effective blockage to the axial sites of the catalytic center and form a distorted sandwich geometry. The shielding prevents chain&#8208;transfer and easy accessibility of polar monomers, leading to a living polymerization. Conducting a light irradiation as part of the one&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic insertion light initiated radical (MILRad) process leads to diblock copolymers of ethylene and acrylates. Incorporation of different acrylate block sequences can significantly modify the mechanical and chemical properties of block copolymers which can be modulated to be a hard plastic, elastomer, or semi&#8208;amorphous polymer.

Conducting a light irradiation as part of the one-step metal-organic insertion light initiated radical (MILRad) process leads to diblock copolymers of ethylene and acrylates. Incorporation of different acrylate block sequences can significantly modify the mechanical and chemical properties of block copolymers which can be modulated to be a hard plastic, elastomer, or semi-amorphous polymer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection and imaging of the plant pathogen response by near infrared fluorescent polyphenol sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plants use secondary metabolites such as polyphenols for chemical defense against pathogens and herbivores. Despite their importance in plant pathogen interactions and tolerance to diseases, it remains challenging to detect polyphenols in complex plant tissues. Here, we create molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging that are based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We identified polyethylene glycol&#8208; phospholipids that render (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs sensitive ( K d&#160; = 90 nM) to plant polyphenols (tannins, flavonoids, &#8230;), which red&#8208;shift (up to 20 nm) and quench their emission (~1000 nm). These sensors report changes in total polyphenol level after herbivore or pathogen challenge in crop plant systems (Soybean&#160; Glycine max ) and leaf tissue extracts ( Tococa spp).&#160; We furthermore demonstrate remote chemical imaging of pathogen&#8208;induced polyphenol release from roots of soybean seedlings over the time course of 24h. This approach allows&#160; in situ&#160; visualization and understanding of the chemical plant defense in real time and paves the way for plant phenotyping for optimized polyphenol secretion.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of an Isolable Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickelacyclobutanes are mostly invoked as reactive intermediates in the reaction of nickel carbenes and olefins to yield cyclopropanes. Nevertheless, early work suggested that other decomposition routes such as &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and even metathesis could be accessible. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of a stable pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane incorporated in a pincer complex. The coordination of different coligands to the nickelacyclobutane determines its selective decomposition along cyclopropanation, metathesis or apparent &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathways. DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism of these different pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: a Green Light Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed Phenylimino Indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch, showing negative photochromism. The isomerization behavior of this photoactuator of the Iminothioindoxyl (ITI) class was studied using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies on time scales from femtoseconds to steady&#8208;state, and by quantum chemical analyses. The understanding of the isomerization properties and substituent effects governing these photoswitches opens new avenues for the development of novel T&#8208;type, visible&#8208;light addressable photoactuators based on C=N bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction Kinetics on Atomically Dispersed Monovalent Zn(I) Sites by Rationally Engineering Proton&#8208;feeding Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for CO2 utilization. Due to the slow proton&#8208;feeding rates from sluggish water dissociation kinetics, however, the CO2RR process involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer is greatly limited by poor selectivity and low yield. Herein, we develop an atomically dispersed monovalent zinc anchored on nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (Zn/NC NSs) as an efficient catalyst for CO2RR. Benefiting from the unique coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the optimized Zn/NC NSs exhibits a superior CO2RR performance, featured by a high current density up to 50 mA cm&#8208;2 with an outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency of &#65374;95%. The center Zn(I) atom coordinated with three N atoms and one N atom that bridge over two adjacent graphitic edge (Zn&#8208;N3+1) is identified as the catalytically active site by thorough structural characterizations. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared absorption spectroscopy results reveal that the twisted Zn&#8208;N3+1 structure accelerates the CO2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *CO2 to *COOH on the rationally engineered proton&#8208;feeding centers, while theoretical calculations elucidate that atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N3+1 moieties decrease the potential barriers for the intermediate COOH* formation, promoting the proton&#8208;coupled CO2RR kinetics and boosting the overall catalytic performance. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 battery based on the Zn/NC NS cathode delivers a maximal power density of 1.8 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;Assembled Film from Semiconductor Nanorods with Ultra&#8208;strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical nanomaterials have generated significant levels of interest for generating strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. We used the Langmuir&#8208;Schaeffer technique to generate the continuous and compact assembly of CdSe/CdS chiral film. We assembled achiral CdSe/CdS nanorods by controlling the number of layers and angles between different layers. This allowed us to tailor chiroptical properties to achieve high CPL signals. The chiral film was symmetrical and had the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and CPL signals with ten layers (RH (right&#8208;handed)&#8208;/LH (left&#8208;handed)&#8208;5 + 5 layers) and a 45&#176; inter&#8208;angle. Specifically, RH&#8208;5+5 of the chiral film exhibited 1431 mdeg of CD activity and strong CPL signals with a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.0997. The helical stacked crystal plates with linear birefringence resulted in strong circular birefringence, as determined by the Reusch model. Electromagnetic simulations indicated that such remarkable optical activity was attributed to the birefringence and dichroism of the well&#8208;aligned CdSe/CdS nanorod layers in the chiral films. Under right/left circular polarized (RCP/LCP) light excitation, the well aligned semiconductor nanorods exhibited differences in the coupling ef&#64257;ciencies to RCP and LCP light. Our CdSe/CdS chiral films, which exhibit ultra&#8208;strong CPL activity, will provide a novel strategy for the fabrication of chiroptical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues,  phomYc  ,  phomYd  , and  phomYe  , are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged, and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Targetable conformationally restricted cyanines enable photon&#8208;count limited applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanine dyes are exceptionally useful probes for a range of fluorescence&#8208;based applications, but their photon output can be limited by  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  photoisomerization. We recently demonstrated that appending a ring system to the pentamethine cyanine ring system improves the quantum yield and extends the fluorescence lifetime. Here, we report an optimized synthesis of persulfonated variants that enable efficient labeling of nucleic acids and proteins. We demonstrate that a bifunctional sulfonated tertiary amide significantly improves the optical properties of the resulting bioconjugates. These new conformationally restricted cyanines are compared to the parent cyanine derivatives in a range of contexts. These include their use in the plasmonic hotspot of a DNA&#8208;nanoantenna, in single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications, far&#8208;red fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). These efforts define contexts in which eliminating cyanine isomerization provides meaningful benefits to imaging performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Methane Functionalization with d0 Early Transition Metals Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The undesirable loss of methane (CH4) at remote locations welcomes approaches that ambiently functionalize CH4 on&#8208;site without intense infrastructure investment. Recently, we found that electrochemical oxidation of vanadium(V)&#8208;oxo with bisulfate ligand leads to CH4 activation at ambient conditions. The key question is whether such an observation is a one&#8208;off coincidence or a general strategy for electrocatalyst design. Here, a general scheme of electrocatalytic CH4 activation with d0 early transition metals is established. The pre&#8208;catalysts&#8217; molecular structure, electrocatalytic kinetics, and mechanism were detailed for titanium (IV), vanadium (V), and chromium (VI) species as model systems. After a turnover&#8208;limiting one&#8208;electron electrochemical oxidation, the yielded ligand&#8208;centered cation radicals activate CH4 with low activation energy and high selectivity. The reactivities are universal among early transition metals from Period 4 to 6, and the reactivities trend for different early transition metals correlate with their d orbital energies across periodic table. Our results offer new chemical insights towards developing advanced ambient electrocatalysts of natural gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Ordered Inverse Opal Structures Synthesized from Shape&#8208;Controlled Nanocrystal Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack&#8208;free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO  2  ) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc&#8208;doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO  2  IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO  2  nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack&#8208;free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications.</dc:description>
