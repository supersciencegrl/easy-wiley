      <title>p&#8208;Substituted Tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amines as Ligands for Highly Active ATRP Catalysts: Facile Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <dc:description>We report a facile and efficient two&#8208;step synthetic route for p&#8208;substituted tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) ligands to form Cu complexes with the highest activity in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) to&#8208;date. The synthetic procedure followed a divergent approach, where the p&#8208;Cl substituents in tris(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA3Cl) were replaced in one&#8208;step and high yield by electron&#8208;donating cyclic amines (pyrrolidine (TPMAPYR), piperidine (TPMAPIP), and morpholine (TPMAMOR)) via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The [CuII(TPMANR2)Br]+ complexes exhibited larger energy gaps between frontier molecular orbitals and &gt;0.2 V more negative reduction potentials than [CuII(TPMA)Br]+, indicating &gt;3 orders of magnitude higher ATRP activity. [CuI(TPMAPYR)]+ exhibited the highest reported activity for Br&#8208;capped acrylate chain ends in DMF, and moderate activity toward C&#8208;F bonds at room temperature. [CuI(TPMANR2)]+ could react with acrylate radicals forming organometallic species. However, this side reaction is suppressed in polymerization, because of the low equilibrium concentration of [CuI(TPMANR2)]+. Indeed, ATRP of n&#8208;butyl acrylate using only 10&#8208;25 part per million loadings of [CuII(TPMANR2)Br]+ exhibited excellent control.</dc:description>

      <title>In vivo imaging of the tumor&#8208;associated enzyme NCEH1 with a covalent PET probe</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the development of an 18F&#8208;labeled, activity&#8208;based small molecule probe targeting the cancer&#8208;associated serine hydrolase NCEH1. We undertook a focused medicinal chemistry campaign to simultaneously preserve potent and specific NCEH1 labeling in live cells and animals, while permitting facile 18F radionuclide incorporation required for PET imaging. The resulting molecule, [18F]JW199, labels active NCEH1 in live cells at nM concentrations and greater than 1,000&#8208;fold selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. [18F]JW199 displays rapid, NCEH1&#8208;dependent accumulation in mouse tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that [18F]JW199 labels aggressive cancer tumor cells in vivo, which uncovered localized NCEH1 activity at the leading edge of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumors, suggesting roles for NCEH1 in tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. More generally, these data support the broader development of potent and specific covalent PET probes to visualize localized, active enzymes in live animals.</dc:description>

      <title>Porous Organic Polymer Nanotrap for Efficient Extraction of Palladium</title>
      <dc:description>To offset the environmental impact of platinum group element (PGE) mining, recycling techniques are being thoroughly explored. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have shown significant promise, due to their selectivity and ability to withstand harsh conditions. A series of pyridine&#8208;based POP nanotraps, POP&#8208;Py, POP&#8208;pNH2&#8208;Py, and POP&#8208;oNH2&#8208;Py, have been rationally designed and systematically explored for the capture of palladium, one of the most utilized PGEs. All the POP nanotraps demonstrated record uptakes and rapid capture, with the amino group shown to be vital in improving performance. Further testing on the POP nanotrap regeneration and selectivity found that POP&#8208;oNH2&#8208;Py outperformed POP&#8208;pNH2&#8208;Py. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis indicated that POP&#8208;oNH2&#8208;Py provided a stronger complex compared to POP&#8208;pNH2&#8208;Py due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino group and coordinated chlorine molecules.

      <title>Development of CDK2 and CDK5 Dual Degrader TMX&#8208;2172</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Development of CDK2 inhibitors has been extremely challenging as its ATP&#8208;binding site shares high similarity with CDK1, a related kinase whose inhibition causes toxic effects. Here, we report the development of TMX&#8208;2172, a heterobifunctional CDK2 degrader with degradation selectivity for CDK2 and CDK5 over not only CDK1, but transcriptional CDKs (CDK7 and CDK9) and cell cycle CDKs (CDK4 and CDK6) as well. In addition, we demonstrate that antiproliferative activity in ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR8) depends on CDK2 degradation and correlates with high expression of cyclin E1 (CCNE1), which functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK2. Collectively, our work provides evidence that TMX&#8208;2172 represents a lead for further development and that CDK2 degradation is a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy in ovarian and other cancers that overexpress CCNE1.</dc:description>

      <title>TiCl3&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of 2,3,3&#8208;Trisubstituted Indolenines:&#160;Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dehydroaspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;Condyfoline and (&#8208;)&#8208;Tubifoline</title>
      <dc:description>2,3,3&#8208;Trisubstituted indolenine constitutes an integral part of many biologically important monoterpene indole alkaloids. We report herein an unprecedented access to this skeleton by a TiCl  3  &#8208;mediated reductive cyclization of tetrasubstituted alkenes bearing a 2&#8208;nitrophenyl substituent. The proof of concept is demonstrated firstly by accomplishing a concise total synthesis of (+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;dehydroaspidospermidine featuring a late stage application of this key transformation. A sequence of reduction of nitroarene to nitrosoarene followed by 6&#960; electron 5 atom electrocyclization and 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift of the resulting nitrone intermediate was proposed to account for the reaction outcome. A subsequent total synthesis of (+)&#8208;condyfoline not only illustrates the generality of the reaction, but also provides a mechanistic insight on the nature of the 1,2&#8208;alkyl shift. The exclusive formation of (+)&#8208;condyfoline indicates that the 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration follows a concerted Wagner&#8208;Meerwein pathway, rather than a stepwise retro&#8208;Mannich/Mannich reaction sequence. Conditions for nearly quantitative conversion of (+)&#8208;condyfoline to (&#8208;)&#8208;tubifoline by way of retro&#8208;Mannich/1,3&#8208;prototropy/transannular cyclization cascade are also documented.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Catalytic Conversion of Ethanol to C5+ Ketones: Role of PdZn Alloy on Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
      <dc:description>Ethanol can be used as a platform molecule for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuel precursors. Direct synthesis of C  5+  ketones, building blocks for lubricants and hydrocarbon fuels, from ethanol was achieved over a stable Pd&#8208;promoted ZnO&#8208;ZrO  2  catalyst.&#160; The sequence of reaction steps involved in the C  5+  ketone formation from ethanol was determined.

The formation of a Pd&#8208;Zn alloy in&#8208;situ was identified to be the critical factor in maintaining high yield to the C  5+  ketones and the stability of the catalyst. A yield of &gt;70% to C  5+  ketones was achieved over a 0.1% Pd&#8208;ZnO&#8208;ZrO  2  mixed oxide catalyst, and the catalyst was demonstrated to be stable beyond 2000 hours on stream without any catalyst deactivation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Polymeric carbon nitride materials have been successfully used in numerous light&#8208;to&#8208;energy conversion applications ranging from photocatalysis to optoelectronics.

IBS were found to be responsible for the enhanced K&#8208;PHI absorption in the near IR region, to serve as electron traps, and to be useful in energy transfer reactions. Once excited with visible light, carbon nitrides, beside the direct recombination, can also undergo singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing. We utilized the K&#8208;PHI centered triplet excited states to trigger a cascade of energy transfer reactions and, in turn, to sensitize, for example, singlet oxygen (1O2) as a starting point to synthesis up to 25 different N&#8208;rich heterocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Unusual Through&#8208;Space Interactions between Oxygen Atoms that Mediate Inverse Morphochromism of an AIE Luminogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Close O&#8722;O contacts make me redder: The tetrafurylethene AIE luminogen has a strong red morphochromism going from the aggregate to the crystalline phase (27&#8197;nm). This is due to unusually short O&#8722;O contacts that are facilitated by circularly delocalized &#960; electron density between the furan rings.







Abstract
We have studied the photophysics of tetrafurylethene, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen with exceptionally short intramolecular O&#8722;O distances of 2.80&#8197;&#197; and a significant red&#8208;shifted morphochromism (27&#8197;nm) when going from the aggregate to the crystal. The short O&#8722;O distances, which are substantially smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04&#8197;&#197;), are due to the fact that the oxygen atoms act as an electronic bridge connecting the furan rings on opposite ends of the central double bond, giving rise to a circular delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electron density across the rings. In the excited state the O&#8722;O distance is further reduced to 2.70&#8197;&#197;; the increased O&#8722;O interaction causes a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in the red morphochromism of the emission. Our results show the structural origin of the red&#8208;shifted emission lies in close O&#8722;O contacts, paving the way for understanding the clusteroluminescence of oxygen&#8208;rich non&#8208;conjugated systems that emit visible light.

     alt="Unusual Through&#8208;Space Interactions between Oxygen Atoms that Mediate Inverse Morphochromism of an AIE Luminogen"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Close O&#8722;O contacts make me redder&lt;/b&gt;: The tetrafurylethene AIE luminogen has a strong red morphochromism going from the aggregate to the crystalline phase (27&#8197;nm). This is due to unusually short O&#8722;O contacts that are facilitated by circularly delocalized &#960; electron density between the furan rings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have studied the photophysics of tetrafurylethene, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen with exceptionally short intramolecular O&#8722;O distances of 2.80&#8197;&#197; and a significant red&#8208;shifted morphochromism (27&#8197;nm) when going from the aggregate to the crystal. The short O&#8722;O distances, which are substantially smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04&#8197;&#197;), are due to the fact that the oxygen atoms act as an electronic bridge connecting the furan rings on opposite ends of the central double bond, giving rise to a circular delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electron density across the rings. In the excited state the O&#8722;O distance is further reduced to 2.70&#8197;&#197;; the increased O&#8722;O interaction causes a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in the red morphochromism of the emission. Our results show the structural origin of the red&#8208;shifted emission lies in close O&#8722;O contacts, paving the way for understanding the clusteroluminescence of oxygen&#8208;rich non&#8208;conjugated systems that emit visible light.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unraveling Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Behavior in Steric&#8208;Hindrance Photochromic System for Super Resolution Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual AIE behavior: The steric&#8208;hindrance photochromic system efficiently regulates the intramolecular rotational/vibrational magnitude and intermolecular stacking to tune aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity. The off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescent photoswitch is successfully established in super resolution imaging.







Abstract
Unprecedented dual aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior based on a steric&#8208;hindrance photochromic system is presented, with incorporation one or two bulky aryl groups, resulting in different flexibleness. The dual AIE behavior of open and closed isomers can be explained by restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR), restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV), and intermolecular stacking. The large bulky benzothiophene causes restricted rotation, enhancing the emission of open form in solution and weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecular packing, thereby efficiently enhancing the luminescence performance in the solid state. With incorporation of two large bulky benzothiophene groups, BBTE possesses the most outstanding AIE activity, undergoing highly efficient and reversible off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescence in film upon alternating UV and visible light irradiation along with excellent fatigue resistance. The off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescent photoswitch is successfully established in super resolution imaging.

      <title>Oppositely Charged Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes with 2D Nanofluidic Channels for Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the blue: Osmotic energy, known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is derived by capturing this salinity gradient energy between sea water and fresh water. Negatively and positively charged lamellar MXene membranes with confined 2D nanofluidic channels give high&#8208;efficient osmotic energy harvesting, with a high output power density of 4.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing artificial sea water (SW) and river water (RW), which is close to the commercialization benchmark (5&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2).







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis (RED) is considered as the most promising technique to harvest osmotic energy. However, the traditional membranes are limited by high internal resistance and low efficiency, resulting in undesirable power densities. Herein, we report the combination of oppositely charged Ti3C2Tx MXene membranes (MXMs) with confined 2D nanofluidic channels as high&#8208;performance osmotic power generators. The negatively or positively charged 2D MXene nanochannels exhibit typical surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport and show excellent cation or anion selectivity. By mixing the artificial sea water (0.5&#8201;m NaCl) and river water (0.01&#8201;m NaCl), we obtain a maximum power density of ca. 4.6&#8197;Wm&#8722;2, higher than most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generators, and very close to the commercialization benchmark (5&#8197;Wm&#8722;2). Through connecting ten tandem MXM&#8208;RED stacks, the output voltage can reach up 1.66&#8197;V, which can directly power the electronic devices.

      <title>Diverse Nanoassemblies of Graphene Quantum Dots and Their Mineralogical Counterparts</title>
      <dc:description>
Complex structures from nanoparticles are found in rocks, soils, and sea sediments but the mechanisms of their formation are poorly understood.

Abstract
Complex structures from nanoparticles are found in rocks, soils, and sea sediments but the mechanisms of their formation are poorly understood, which causes controversial conclusions about their genesis. Here we show that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into complex structures driven by coordination interactions with metal ions commonly present in environment and serve a special role in Earth's history, such as Fe3+ and Al3+. GQDs self&#8208;assemble into mesoscale chains, sheets, supraparticles, nanoshells, and nanostars. Specific assembly patterns are determined by the effective symmetry of the GQDs when forming the coordination assemblies with the metal ions. As such, maximization of the electronic delocalization of &#960;&#8208;orbitals of GQDs with Fe3+ leads to GQD&#8208;Fe&#8208;GQD units with D2 symmetry, dipolar bonding potential, and linear assemblies. Taking advantage of high electron microscopy contrast of carbonaceous nanostructures in respect to ceramic background, the mineralogical counterparts of GQD assemblies are found in mineraloid shungite. These findings provide insight into nanoparticle dynamics during the rock formation that can lead to mineralized structures of unexpectedly high complexity.

      <title>High&#8208;Curvature Transition&#8208;Metal Chalcogenide Nanostructures with a Pronounced Proximity Effect Enable Fast and Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
The needle has landed: CdS nanostructures with sharp tips can generate large electric fields that lead to increased CO2 concentrations for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The localized electric fields are significantly enhanced when two nanoneedles are in close proximity. These advantages result in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction with a 95.5&#177;4.0&#8201;% CO Faraday efficiency.







Abstract
A considerable challenge in the conversion of carbon dioxide into useful fuels comes from the activation of CO2 to CO2.&#8722; or other intermediates, which often requires precious&#8208;metal catalysts, high overpotentials, and/or electrolyte additives (e.g., ionic liquids). We report a microwave heating strategy for synthesizing a transition&#8208;metal chalcogenide nanostructure that efficiently catalyzes CO2 electroreduction to carbon monoxide (CO). We found that the cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoneedle arrays exhibit an unprecedented current density of 212&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 95.5&#177;4.0&#8201;% CO Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; without iR correction). Experimental and computational studies show that the high&#8208;curvature CdS nanostructured catalyst has a pronounced proximity effect which gives rise to large electric field enhancement, which can concentrate alkali&#8208;metal cations resulting in the enhanced CO2 electroreduction efficiency.

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Organic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking the shortcut: Examples of tunneling by second&#8208;row atoms are increasing and the limits are being expanded. This Minireview summarizes recent examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling, highlights unique approaches for its detection, and describes computational efforts toward its prediction. Common features of these reactions and future challenges are discussed.







Abstract
In the past few years, numerous investigations have been reported on the role of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling in the area of pericyclic reactions, &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting, and other processes. These studies illustrate unique strategies for the experimental detection of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and the increased use of calculations to predict it. This Minireview focuses primarily on carbon tunneling in ground&#8208;state processes but also highlights nitrogen tunneling and the first example of excited&#8208;state heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. Salient features of these reactions along with potential limitations are discussed, as well as challenges and directions for future investigation.

      <title>Free&#8208;Standing CoO&#8208;POM Janus&#8208;like Ultrathin Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Van der Waals integration of ultrathin Janus&#8208;like 2D heterostructures can also be achieved in a single step through a solution&#8208;based approach. The structural configuration can be simply changed by proper selection of solvents. Such a heteromaterial has tunable properties and can be used as an advanced oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
A single&#8208;step solution&#8208;based strategy is used to obtain 2D Janus&#8208;like free&#8208;standing ultrathin nanosheets build from two structurally unrelated species, that is, polyoxomolybdate (POM) and CoO. A controlled 2D&#8208;to&#8208;1D morphological transition was achieved by judiciously adjusting the solvent choice. These POM&#8208;CoO heterostructures can behave as an ideal catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene. Benefiting from their amphiphilic nature, these 2D POM&#8208;CoO nanosheets have also been used as surfactant to emulsify immiscible solvents. It is anticipated that structurally diverse polyoxometalates will offer promise as design elements for variety of structurally and compositionally tunable van der Waals integrated heteromaterials having a broad range applications.

      <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Additives Electrolyte enables Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Rechargeable Li metal anode coupling with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is a promising tendency for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries exceeding 300 Wh kg&#8208;1. However, achieving long lifespan under realistic conditions remains a &#8220;Gordian knot&#8221; for practical&#8208;used cells because of the low Li reversibility and electrolyte exhaustion. Here, we report an advancing dual&#8208;additives electrolyte containing unique solvation structure of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane additives and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, which can generate the outer&#8208;Li2O robust solid electrolyte interface and F&#8208;,B&#8208;containing conformal cathode electrolyte interphase. The resulting stable ion transport kinetics enables excellent cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 for 140 cycles with 80% capacity retention under highly challenging conditions (~295.1 Wh kg&#8208;1 at cell&#8208;level). The electrolyte also exhibits high cycling stability for 4.6&#8201;V LiCoO2 (160 cycles with 89.8% capacity retention) and 4.95V LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable Li metal anode coupling with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is a promising tendency for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries exceeding 300 Wh kg&#8208;1. However, achieving long lifespan under realistic conditions remains a &#8220;Gordian knot&#8221; for practical&#8208;used cells because of the low Li reversibility and electrolyte exhaustion.

      <title>Lead&#8208;Free Halide Double Perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 with Decreased Bandgap</title>
      <dc:description>Environmentally friendly halide double perovskites with improved stability are regarded as a promising alternative to lead halide perovskites. The benchmark double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, shows attractive optical and electronic features, making it promising for high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices. However, the large bandgap limits its further applications, especially for photovoltaics. Herein, we develop a novel crystal&#8208;engineering strategy to significantly decrease the bandgap by ~0.26 eV, reaching the smallest reported bandgap of 1.72 eV for Cs2AgBiBr6 at ambient conditions. The bandgap narrowing is confirmed by both absorption and photoluminescence measurements. Our first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that enhanced Ag&#8208;Bi disorder has a large impact on the band structure and decreases the bandgap, providing a possible explanation of the observed bandgap narrowing effect.

      <title>Recent Progress in PROTACs and Other Chemical Protein Degradation Technologies for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
      <dc:description>Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a group of diseases that cause neural cell damage, leading to motility and/or cognitive dysfunctions. One of the causative agents is misfolded protein aggregates, which are considered as undruggable in terms of conventional tools, such as inhibitors and agonists/antagonists. Indeed, there is currently no FDA&#8208;approved drug for the causal treatment of NDs. However, emerging technologies for chemical protein degradation are opening up the possibility of selective elimination of target proteins through physiological protein degradation machineries, which do not depend on the functions of the target proteins. Here, we review recent efforts towards the treatment of NDs using chemical protein degradation technologies, and we briefly discuss the challenges and prospects.</dc:description>

In this paper, we report an efficient method for polymer&#8208;drug conjugates using an ultrafast and reversible click reaction in a post&#8208;polymerization functionalization strategy.

      <dc:description>Main group analogues of cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls are fascinating due to their unique reactivity and electronic properties. So far only heteronuclear examples have been isolated. Here we report the isolation and characterization of all&#8208;silicon 1,3&#8208;cyclobutandiyls as stable closed&#8208;shell singlet species from the reversible reactions of cyclotrisilene c&#8208;Si3Tip4 (Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl) with the N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes c&#8209;[(CR2CH2)(NtBu)2]Si: (R = H or methyl) with saturated backbones. At elevated temperatures, tetrasilacyclobutenes are obtained from these equilibrium mixtures. The corresponding reaction with an unsaturated N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene c&#8208;(CH)2(NtBu)2Si: proceeds directly to the corresponding tetrasilacyclobutene without detection of the assumed 1,3&#8208;cyclobutandiyl intermediate.</dc:description>

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: New Vistas at the Aggregate Level</title>
      <dc:description>
The importance of the whole picture: Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) research demonstrates that many properties and functions that are absent in molecular species can be found in molecular aggregates. AIE research thus emphasizes the significance of aggregate science in addition to molecular science for materials development.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) describes a photophysical phenomenon in which molecular aggregates exhibit stronger emission than the single molecules. Over the course of the last 20 years, AIE research has made great strides in material development, mechanistic study and high&#8208;tech applications. The achievements of AIE research demonstrate that molecular aggregates show many properties and functions that are absent in molecular species. In this review, we summarize the advances in the field of AIE and its related areas. We specifically focus on the new properties of materials attained by molecular aggregates beyond the microscopic molecular level. We hope this review will inspire more research into molecular ensembles at and beyond the meso level and lead to the significant progress in material and biological science.

      <title>Electrochemical Phase Evolution of Metal&#8208;Based Pre&#8208;Catalysts for High&#8208;Rate Polysulfide Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ evolution of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in defining catalytic reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003136), J.&#8208;Q. Huang and co&#8208;workers reveal the electrochemical phase evolution of metal&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts in working Li&#8211;S batteries that enables stable operation of high&#8208;rate and electrolyte&#8208;starved Li&#8211;S batteries. The general concept of electrochemically induced sulfurization is verified by thermodynamic energetics for most of low&#8208;valence metal compounds, which reshapes the understanding of polysulfide electrocatalysis and enlightens other catalytic reactions in aprotic electrochemistry.

      <title>Pigmentation Chemistry and Radical&#8208;Based Collagen Degradation in Alkaptonuria and Osteoarthritic Cartilage</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare genetic disease that leads to cartilage pigmentation and degradation, a symptom first reported by Rudolf Virchow of Charit&#233; Hospital in Berlin in 1866. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR and EPR spectroscopy, W.&#8197;Y. Chow, J.&#8197;A. Gallagher, H. Oschkinat, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000618) indicate a role for semiquinone radicals in the chemistry of the pigmentation process, and propose that transient glycyl radicals underlie the collagen degradation in this disease.

      <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;mediated water capture and release in composite materials including a metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;101(Cr)) and a thermo&#8208;responsive polymer (poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide, PNIPAM) is demonstrated by G. Maurin, D. Zhao, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002384). PNIPAM is introduced into the cavity of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) by in&#8208;situ polymerization of the loaded monomer. The resultant composites show very high water uptake and can release most of the adsorbed water at a slightly elevated temperature by the hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic phase transition of the PNIPAM component.

Maurin, D. Zhao, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200238410.1002/anie.202002384&lt;/a&gt;). PNIPAM is introduced into the cavity of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) by in&#8208;situ polymerization of the loaded monomer. The resultant composites show very high water uptake and can release most of the adsorbed water at a slightly elevated temperature by the hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic phase transition of the PNIPAM component.

      <title>Identifying the adsorbed hydroxyl transfer kinetics as a descriptor of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The key descriptor that dominates the kinetics of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has not yet fully been identified so far. Herein, we isolate adsorption hydroxyl (OHad) transfer process (OHad + e&#8211; &#8596; OH&#8211;) and reveal its crucial role in promoting the overall kinetics of alkaline HER based on Ni/Co modified MoSe2 model catalysts (Ni&#8208;MoSe2 and Co&#8208;MoSe2) that feature almost identical water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption energies, but evidently different activity trends in alkaline (Ni&#8208;MoSe2 &gt;&gt; Co&#8208;MoSe2) and acidic (Co&#8208;MoSe2 &#8805; Ni&#8208;MoSe2) media. Experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that tailoring MoSe2 with Ni not only optimizes the adsorption of OHad, but also promotes the desorption of OH&#8211; and the electron&#8208;involved conversion of OHad to OH&#8211;, all of which synergistically accelerate the kinetics of OHad + e&#8211; &#8596; OH&#8211; and thereby the overall kinetics of the alkaline HER. The successful isolating and deeper understanding of OHad + e&#8211; &#8596; OH&#8211; as the critical descriptor of the alkaline HER, shed a new light for designing highly efficient alkaline HER catalysts.</dc:description>

This design retained the optical and cellular uptake properties of DNA&#8208;functionalized AuNPs, while showed high&#8208;fidelity signaling. It discriminated target cancer cells even in a mixed cell culture system, while the Au&#8208;S based nanoflare was less sensitive.

      <title>Chiral CuxCoyS Nanoparticles under Magnetic Field and NIR Light to Synergistically Eliminate Senescent Cells</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, chiral Cu  x  Co  y  S nanoparticles (NPs) were developed to selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells using both an alternating magnetic field (AMF) and near infrared (NIR) photon illumination. The chiral effects on living cells were investigated, and  D  &#8208;Cu  x  Co  y  S NPs showed about 2.5 times higher of internalized ability than  L  &#8208;NPs. By modifying beta 2 macroglobulin (MG), senescent cells were effectively eliminated by  D  &#8208;Cu  x  Co  y  S NPs without damaging the activities of normal cells under AMF and photon illumination. Compared with the individual application of NIR illumination and AMF, their synergistic effect induced the production of caspase&#8208;3 with a much shorter treatment time and higher efficiency due to the more serious photon&#8208;induced cellular redox and mechanical damage of cellular skeleton. Moreover, the developed strategy was successfully used to remove senescent cells  in vivo  . This study developed a controllable way of regulating cell activities using chiral NPs, which will provide a valuable way for treating diseases and promoting health.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecularly tailored lithium&#8211;arene complex enables chemical prelithiation of high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes</title>
      <dc:description>Prelithiation is of great interest to Li&#8208;ion battery manufacturers to compensate for the inevitable loss of active Li during initial cycling of a battery that would otherwise degrade its available energy density. Nevertheless, none of the current strategies are suited for mass production due to lack of control, homogeneity, safety and scalability. Solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation using a reductive chemical promises unparalleled reaction homogeneity and simplicity. Thus far, however, the applied chemicals of inadequate reducing strength have not succeeded in doping active Li in Si&#8208;based high&#8208;capacity anodes but merely formed solid&#8211;electrolyte interphases, leading to only partial mitigation of the cycle irreversibility. Here, we show that a molecularly engineered Li&#8211;arene complex with a sufficiently low redox potential drives active Li accommodation in Si&#8208;based anodes to grant ideal Li contents in a full cell. Fine control over the prelithiation degree and spatial uniformity of active Li throughout the electrodes are achieved by managing time and temperature during immersion, promising both fidelity and low cost of the process for large&#8208;scale integration.</dc:description>

      <title>Embedding Functional Biomacromolecules within Peptides&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanoarchitectures Enables Activity Enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>Rationally tailoring a robust artificial coating can enhance the life&#8208;time of the fragile biomacromolecules. However, the shrouded coating also can restrain the activity of the guest because of the decreased substrate accessibility. Herein, we report a peptides&#8208;directed strategy that enables to tailor the MOFs&#8208;shrouded biohybrids into controllable nanoarchitectures in&#8208;situ. The MOFs biohybrid is feasible to be shaped from different 3D microporous architectures to 2D mesoporous layer by a peptide modulator. Based on this mild strategy, we reveal that the nanoarchitectures of MOFs coating significantly affect the biological functions of the hosted biomacromolecules, and demonstrate that the biomacromolecules entrapped within the novel 2D mesoporous spindle&#8208;shaped MOFs (2D MSMOFs) can significantly boost their bioactivity compared with that entrapped within the hitherto explored 3D microporous MOFs, attributing to the shortened diffusion path and enlarged pore channel in 2D MSMOFs that facilitates the intercommunication for biotransformation. Meanwhile, the engineered 2D MSMOFs thin layer also can provide excellent protective effect on the hosted biomacromolecules or proteins&#8208;scaffolded biominerals through structural confinement.</dc:description>

      <title>The Six Isomers of the Cyclohexanol Dimer: A Delicate Test for Dispersion Models</title>
      <dc:description>The cyclohexanol homodimer is a delicate test model of the role of&#160;dispersion&#160;forces&#160;in intermolecular association. While phenol produces a single dimer, suppression of&#160;&#960;&#160;interactions&#160;and larger conformational flexibility&#160;in cyclohexanol results in multiple isomerism, as six competing dimers of the free molecule are observed in a supersonic jet expansion.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cyclohexanol homodimer is a delicate test model of the role of&#160;dispersion&#160;forces&#160;in intermolecular association. While phenol produces a single dimer, suppression of&#160;&#960;&#160;interactions&#160;and larger conformational flexibility&#160;in cyclohexanol results in multiple isomerism, as six competing dimers of the free molecule are observed in a supersonic jet expansion. Rotational spectroscopy reveals accurate structural data, specifically the formation of homo&#8208; and heterochiral diasteroisomers and the presence of both equatorial and axial forms in the dimers. Four dispersion&#8208;corrected density&#8208;functional molecular orbital calculations were tested against the experiment, with&#160;B3LYP&#8208;D3(BJ)&#160;offering good structural reproducibility with an&#160;Alrich&#8217;s triple&#8208;&#950;&#160;basis set.

      <title>Quantum Dot&#8208;Catalyzed Photoreductive Removal of Sulfonyl&#8208;Based Protecting Groups</title>
      <dc:description>This communication describes the use of CuInS&#173;  2  /ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as photocatalysts for the reductive deprotection of aryl sulfonyl&#8208;protected phenols. For a series of aryl sulfonates with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, the rate of deprotection for the corresponding phenyl aryl sulfonates increases with decreasing electrochemical potential for the two electron transfers within the catalytic cycle. The rate of deprotection for a substrate that contains a carboxylic acid, a known QD&#8208;binding group, is accelerated by more than a factor of ten from that expected from the electrochemical potential for the transformation, a result that suggests that formation of metastable electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes provides a significant kinetic advantage. This deprotection method does not perturb the common NHBoc or toluenesulfonyl protecting groups and, as demonstrated with an estrone substrate, does not perturb proximate ketones, which are generally vulnerable to many chemical reduction methods used for this class of reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring ovarian cancer cell resistance to rhenium anticancer complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Rhenium tricarbonyl complexes have been recently investigated as novel anticancer agents. However, little is understood about their mechanisms of action, as well as the means by which cancer cells respond to chronic exposure to these compounds. To gain a deeper mechanistic insight into these rhenium anticancer agents, we developed and characterized an ovarian cancer cell line that is resistant to a previously studied compound [Re(CO)  3  (dmphen)(ptolICN)]  +  , where dmphen = 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and  p  tolICN =  para  &#8208;tolyl isonitrile, called TRIP. This TRIP&#8208;resistant ovarian cancer cell line, A2780TR, was found to be 9 times less sensitive to TRIP compared to the wild&#8208;type A2780 ovarian cancer cell line. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of established drugs and other rhenium anticancer agents in the TRIP&#8208;resistant cell line were determined. Notably, the drug taxol was found to exhibit a 184&#8208;fold decrease in activity in the A2780TR cell line, suggesting that mechanisms of resistance towards TRIP and this drug are similar. Accordingly, expression levels of the ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter P&#8208;glycoprotein, an efflux transporter known to detoxify taxol, were found to be elevated in the A2780TR cell line. Additionally, a gene expression analysis using the National Cancer Institute 60 cell line panel identified the  MT1E  gene to be overexpressed in cells that are less sensitive to TRIP. Because this gene encodes for metallothioneins, this result suggests that detoxification by this class of proteins is another mechanism for resistance to TRIP. The importance of this gene in the A2780TR cell line was assessed, confirming that its expression is elevated in this cell line as well. As the first study to investigate and identify the cancer cell resistance pathways in response to a rhenium complex, this report high&#8208;lights important similarities and differences in the resistance responses of ovarian cancer cells to TRIP and conventional drugs.</dc:description>

Here, we developed dual&#8208;functionalized crescent microgels, which selectively captured and killed lung cancer cells in situ without killing other cells.

Exposing the crescent hydrogels to physiological concentrations of glucose leads to the production of a locally high concentration of H  2  O  2  inside the microgels&#8217; cavities, due to the catalytic action by GOX inside the gel matrix, which selectively killed 90% cancer cells entrapped in the microgel cavities without killing the cells outside.

      <title>Ag2Au50(PET)36 Nanocluster: Dimeric Assembly of Au25(PET)18 Enabled by Silver Atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Assembly of atomically precise metal nanoclusters is now in the research spotlight, which offers exciting opportunities to gain fundamental insights into the hierarchical assembly of nanoparticles. However, it is still extremely challenging for controllable assembly of individual nanoclusters at a molecular&#8208; or atomic&#8208;level. Herein we report the dimeric assembly of Au25(PET)18  (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol), where two Au25(PET)18  monomers are bridged together by two Ag atoms to form the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer. The Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is an exclusive mesomer, which has not been found in any other chiral metal nanoclusters belonging to the racemic category. Furthermore, the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is distinct from the Au25(PET)18  monomer on the optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. This study is expected to provide a feasible strategy to precisely modulate the assembly of metal nanoclusters with controllable structures and properties.</dc:description>

Herein we report the dimeric assembly of Au25(PET)18  (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol), where two Au25(PET)18  monomers are bridged together by two Ag atoms to form the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer. The Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is an exclusive mesomer, which has not been found in any other chiral metal nanoclusters belonging to the racemic category. Furthermore, the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is distinct from the Au25(PET)18  monomer on the optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. This study is expected to provide a feasible strategy to precisely modulate the assembly of metal nanoclusters with controllable structures and properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>DNA&#8208;Edited Ligand Positioning on Red Blood Cells to Enable Optimized T Cell Activation for Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Artificial antigen presenting cells (APCs) with surface&#8208;anchored T cell activating ligands hold great potential in adoptive immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to precisely control the ligand positioning on those platforms via conventional bioconjugation chemistry. Here, utilizing DNA&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, we are able to precisely control both lateral and vertical distribution of T cell activation ligands on red blood cells (RBCs). It is found that the clustered lateral positioning of peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on RBCs with a short vertical distance to the cell membrane would be favorable for more effective T cell activation, likely owing to their better mimic of natural APCs. Such optimized RBC&#8208;based artificial APCs can stimulate T cell proliferation in vivo and effectively inhibit tumor growth via adoptive immunotherapy. DNA technology is thus a unique tool to precisely engineer the cell membrane interface and tune cell&#8208;cell interactions, promising for a wide range of applications including immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Nanolithography Enables Highly Ordered Recognition Interface in Microfluidic Chip for Efficient Capture and Release of Circulating Tumor Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Microfluidic chip with nano&#8208;scale structures has shown great potential, but the fabrication and cost issues restrict its application. Here, we propose a conceptually new &#8220;DNA nanolithography in microfluidic chip&#8221; by using sub&#8208;10 nm three&#8208;dimensional DNA structures (TDNs) as frameworks with a pendant aptamer at the top vertex (ApTDN&#8208;Chip). The nano&#8208;scale framework ensures the aptamer with a highly ordered upright orientation, avoiding the undesired orientation or crowding effects caused by conventional microfluidic interface fabrication processes. Compared with a monovalent aptamer modified chip, the capture efficiency of ApTDN&#8208;Chip was enhanced nearly 60% due to the highly precise dimension and rigid framework of TDNs. In addition, the confined tetrahedral nanostructure scaffolds make DNase I more accessible to aptamer with up to 83% release efficiency and 91% cell viability, which is fully compatible with downstream molecular analysis. Overall, &#8220;DNA nanolithography in microfluidic chip&#8221; provides a novel perspective to engineer nano&#8208;scaffolds to achieve a more ordered nano&#8208;topography of microfluidic chip.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation from CdTe Photoanodes Annealed with CdCl2</title>
      <dc:description>CdTe absorbs sunlight up to 830 nm and has the potential to promote efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, most CdTe photoanodes and CdTe photocathodes show positive and negative photocurrent onset potentials for water oxidation and reduction, respectively, and are thus unable to drive PEC water splitting without external applied biases. In this work, we enhanced the activity of a CdTe photoanode having an internal p&#8208;n junction during PEC water oxidation by applying a CdCl  2  annealing treatment together with surface modifications. The resulting CdTe photoanode generated photocurrents of 1.8 and 5.4 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0.6 and 1.2 V  RHE  , respectively, with a photoanodic current onset potential of 0.22 V  RHE  under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G). The CdCl  2  annealing increased the grain sizes in this material and lowered the density of grain boundaries, allowing for more efficient charge separation. Consequently, a two&#8208;electrode tandem PEC cell comprising a CdTe&#8208;based photoanode and photocathode split water without any external bias at a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.51% at the beginning of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CdTe absorbs sunlight up to 830 nm and has the potential to promote efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.

      <dc:description>The ability to deliberately solution&#8208;print large&#8208;scale perovskite&#8208;based nanostructures represents a significant endeavor towards the convenient creation of a rich variety of optoelectronic materials and devices. Despite recent impressive progress in producing perovskite nanowires (NWs) for optoelectronics, it remains challenging to solution&#8208;print an array of NWs with precisely controlled position and orientation. Herein, we report a robust capillary&#8208;assisted solution printing (CASP) strategy to rapidly access aligned and highly crystalline perovskite NWs array. The key to the CASP approach lies in the judicious integration of capillary&#8208;directed assembly via periodic nanochannels and solution printing via the programmably&#8208;moved substrate to fast guide the deposition of perovskite NWs. The growth kinetics of perovskite NWs is closely examined by in&#8208;situ optical microscopy to scrutinize the perovskite crystallization.

      <title>Magnetic Multistability in an Anion Radical Pimer</title>
      <dc:description>Radical pimers are the simplest and most important models for studying charge transfer processes, and they provide deep insights into &#960;&#8208;stacked organic materials. Notably, radical pimer systems with magnetic bi&#8208; or multistability may have important applications in switchable materials, thermal sensors and information storage media. However, no such systems have been reported. Here, we describe a new pimer consisting of neutral  N  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl) benzene triimide ([BTI&#8208;3C]) and its anionic radical ([BTI&#8208;3C]  &#8208;&#8226;  ), which exhibits rare magnetic multistability. The crystalline pimer was easily synthesized by reduction of BTI&#8208;3C with cobaltocene (CoCp  2  ). The transition occurs with a 27 K&#8208;width thermal hysteresis loop in the range of 170&#8208;220 K, accompanied by a smaller 25 K&#8208;width loop at 220&#8208;242 K. The magnetic multistabilty was attributed to the slippage of the &#960;&#8208;stacked BTI backbones and the entropy&#8208;driven conformational isomerization of the side propyl chains in the crystalline state during temperature variation. Our research demonstrated an unprecedented radical pimer showing magnetic multistability. The high diversity of the substituents on BTI provides great possibilities for designing multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Micromotors for Multiple Motile Sperm Cells Capture, Transport, and Enzymatic Release</title>
      <dc:description>An integrated system combining a magnetically&#8208;driven micromotor and a synthetized protein&#8208;based hyaluronic acid (HA) microflake is presented as a novel strategy for the in&#8208;situ selection and transport of multiple motile sperm cells (ca. 50). The proposed system appeals for targeted sperm delivery in the reproductive system to assist fertilization or to deliver drugs in scenarios where tens to hundreds of sperm are required for an effective therapy. The binding mechanism between the HA microflake and sperm rely on the interactions between HA and the corresponding sperm HA receptors, which are expressed on the sperm membrane when they are mature and with intact DNA. Once sperm are captured within the HA microflake, the assembly is trapped and transported by a magnetically&#8208;driven helical microcarrier. The trapping of the sperm&#8208;microflake occurs by a local vortex induced by the microcarrier during rotation&#8208;translation under a rotating magnetic field. After transport, the microflake is enzymatically hydrolyzed by local proteases, allowing sperm to escape and finally reach the target location.

      <title>Fragmentation of Magic&#8208;Size Cluster Precursor Compounds into Ultrasmall CdS Quantum Dots with Enhanced Particle Yield at Low Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;size CdS quantum dots are synthesized without the coexistence of the precursor compound and thus with enhanced particle yield. It is shown that after the formation of the precursor compound in the pre&#8208;nucleation stage, the addition of tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide facilitates the production of small&#8208;size QDs.







Abstract
Colloidal small&#8208;size CdS quantum dots (QDs) are produced usually with low particle yield, together with side products such as the particular precursor compounds (PCs) of magic&#8208;size clusters (MSC). Here, we report our synthesis of small&#8208;size CdS QDs without the coexistence of the PC and thus with enhanced particle yield. For a conventional reaction of cadmium oleate (Cd(OA)2) and sulfur (S) in 1&#8208;octadecene (ODE), we show that after the formation of the PC in the pre&#8208;nucleation stage, the addition of tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) facilitates the production of small&#8208;size QDs. We demonstrate that TOPO fragmentizes the PC that have formed, which enables the nucleation and growth of small&#8208;size QDs even at room temperature. Our findings introduce a new approach to making small&#8208;size QDs without the coexistence of the PC and with improved particle yield. Providing experimental evidence for the two&#8208;pathway model proposed for the pre&#8208;nucleation stage of colloidal binary QDs, the present study aids in the advance of non&#8208;classical nucleation theory.

      <title>Using the Secondary PH/BH Functional Groups of an Active Geminal Frustrated Lewis Pair for Carbon Monoxide Reduction and Reactions with Nitriles and Isonitriles</title>
      <dc:description>
A P/B pair: The geminal secondary phosphane/borane (PH/BH) pair reduces carbon monoxide to a formaldehyde unit at the P/B template. Formaldehyde is liberated in a subsequent reaction. The PH/BH pair also reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine (not shown).







Abstract
Reaction of the secondary alkynyl(Mes*)PH phosphane 2 with (Fmes)BH2&#8901;SMe2 gives the geminal PH/BH frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) 3. The PH and the BH functions are jointly used in the reduction of carbon monoxide under mild reaction conditions to give the [P]&#8208;CH2&#8208;O&#8208;[B] product. A subsequent cycloaddition sequence results in the liberation of formaldehyde. The FLP 3 reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine, and it couples two isonitriles at the FLP framework.
