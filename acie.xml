         <title>Atom Swapping on Aromatic Rings: Conversion from Phosphinine Pincer Metal Complexes to Metallabenzenes Triggered by O2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel synthetic method for metallabenzene by swapping phosphorous atom in an aromatic phosphinine ring with transition metal fragments. Oxidation of a phosphine&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;phosphine pincer iridium complex by O  2  triggered replacement of the phosphorous atom of the phosphinine ring by an iridium fragment to afford iridabenzene. Dianionic rhodabenzene was also synthesized from a phosphinine rhodium complex by oxidation of the phosphorous atom followed by the subsequent reduction by metallic potassium. The aromaticity of newly synthesized irida&#8208; and rhoda&#8208;benzenes were evaluated experimentally and theoretically.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Full&#8208;Color Tuning of Organic Chromophore in a Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 2D Flexible MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing universal stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of emitting a broad spectrum of colors is highly desirable. Herein, we deliberately grafted a conformation&#8208;adaptable organic chromophore into the established coordination space of a flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). In terms of the coupled structural transformations and the space confinement, the chromophore in the MOF matrix underwent well&#8208;regulated conformational changes under physical and chemical stimuli, simultaneously displaying thermo&#8208;, piezo&#8208;, and solvato&#8208;fluoro&#8208;chromism with color tunability over the visible range. Owing to the resilient nature and the reduced dimensionality of the selected coordination space, all three color modulations behaved in a sensitive and self&#8208;reversible manner, each following a linear correlation of the emission maximum with stimulus. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of the variable&#8208;temperature structures and solvent&#8208;inclusion crystals elucidated the intricate color varying mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Embedded [n]Helicenes (n = 5, 6 and 7)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azulene  is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and  physicochemical  properties. By using the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene&#8208;embedded [  n  ]helicenes (  [  n  ]AzHs  ,  n  = 5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with  n  &#8208;  2  benzene rings.  P&#8208;  and  M  &#8208;  enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of  [5]&#8208;  , and  [6]AzHs  . However,  P  &#8208;  and  M  &#8208;  [  7]AzHs  could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture. These  [  n  ]AzHs  were endowed with new properties by azulene moiety such as  low&#8208;lying first electric state (S  1  )  , small optical energy gap and  anti&#8208;  Kasha emission.  [6]&#8208;  , and  [7]AzHs  exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high  absorption dissymmetry factors  (g  abs  ) maxima of about 0.02, which is among the highest |g  abs  | values of helicenes in the visible range. These azulene&#8208;embedded [  n  ]helicenes would contribute to the library and the structure&#8208;property relationship of non&#8208;benzenoid helicenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Spherical Nucleic Acids for Conditional Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical control of protein activity represents a promising strategy for precise modulation of biological processes. Here, we report rationally designed, aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) capable of noninvasive and programmable regulation of target protein activity by deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The photo&#8208;responsive SNAs are constructed by integrating activatable aptamer modules onto the surface of upconversion nanoparticles. The SNAs remains inert but can be remotely reverted by NIR light irradiation to capture the target protein and thus function as an enzyme inhibitor, while introduction of antidote DNA could further reverse their inhibition functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the SNAs as controllable anticoagulants for the NIR light&#8208;triggered regulation of thrombin function. Ultimately, the availability of diverse aptamers would allow the design to regulate the activities of various proteins in a programmable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Charge&#8208;Separation Mechanisms in Photocatalyst Particles by Spatially Resolved Surface Photovoltage Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge separation is key to efficient photocatalytic solar energy conversion. The distribution of surface charge on photocatalysts can be identified and the driving forces of charge separation quantitatively determined at the nanoscale by the spatially resolved surface photovoltage technique. The identification of photocatalytic charge separation mechanisms will enable the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of solar energy offers a potential route to renewable energy, and its efficiency relies on effective charge separation in nanostructured photocatalysts. Understanding the charge&#8208;separation mechanism is key to improving the photocatalytic performance and this has now been enabled by advances in the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) method. In this Review we highlight progress made by SRSPV in mapping charge distributions at the nanoscale and determining the driving forces of charge separation in heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. We discuss how charge separation arising from a built&#8208;in electric field, diffusion, and trapping can be exploited and optimized through photocatalyst design. We also highlight the importance of asymmetric engineering of photocatalysts for effective charge separation. Finally, we provide an outlook on further opportunities that arise from leveraging these insights to guide the rational design of photocatalysts and advance the imaging technique to expand the knowledge of charge separation.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure Sulfoxides by Concurrent Photocatalytic Oxidation and Biocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concurrent operation of chemical and biocatalytic reactions in one pot is still a challenging task, and, in particular for chemical photocatalysts, examples besides simple cofactor recycling systems are rare. However, especially due to the complementary chemistry that the two fields of catalysis promote, their combination in one pot has the potential to unlock intriguing, unprecedented overall reactivities. Herein we demonstrate a concurrent biocatalytic reduction and photocatalytic oxidation process. Specifically, the enantioselective biocatalytic sulfoxide reduction using (S)&#8208;selective methionine sulfoxide reductases was coupled to an unselective light&#8208;dependent sulfoxidation. Protochlorophyllide was established as a new green photocatalyst for the sulfoxidation. Overall, a cyclic deracemization process to produce nonracemic sulfoxides was achieved and the target compounds were obtained with excellent conversions (up to 91%) and superb optical purity (&gt;99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling of the ADP&#8208;Ribosylome in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Posttranslational modification (PTM) with ADP&#8208;ribose and poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD  +  ) as substrate is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways in eukaryotes, notably the response to DNA damage caused by cellular stress. Nevertheless, due to intrinsic properties of NAD  +  e.g., high polarity and associated poor cell passage, these PTMs are difficult to characterize in cells. Here, two new NAD  +  derivatives are presented, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag and, in combination with developed methods for mild cell delivery, allow studies in living human cells. We show that this approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes such as H  2  O  2  &#8208;induced oxidative stress or the effect of the approved anti&#8208;cancer drug olaparib. Our results therefore pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of the ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteome in living cells in health and disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Acridine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) as Photocatalysts for Metallaphotocatalytic C&#8211;N Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are structurally tuneable, porous and crystalline polymers constructed through the covalent attachment of small organic building blocks as elementary units. Using the myriad of such building blocks, a broad spectrum of functionalities has been applied for COF syntheses for broad applications, including heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new family of porous and crystalline COFs using a novel acridine linker and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde derivatives bearing a variable number of hydroxy groups. With the broad absorption in the visible light region the COFs were applied as photocatalysts in metallaphotocatalytic C&#8211;N cross coupling. The fully &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine linked COF showed the highest activity, due to the increased charge separation upon irradiation. The COF showed good to excellent yields for several aryl bromides, good recyclability and even catalysed the organic transformation in presence of green light as energy source.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering CoS2 as electron reservoirs overcomes the limited length of the electron diffusion tunnel over an insulating sulfur cathode and thus achieves fast reaction kinetics in sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. With the assistance of Co1 single atoms, this strategy provides streamlined redox paths, which reduce the formation of unstable polysulfides and enable stable sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double&#8208;end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short&#8208;chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long&#8208;chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as&#8208;developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high cycling capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 5000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene quantum dots were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst was constructed as a promising model system of an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE, but also remarkably enhances photostability.







Abstract
The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, MXene quantum dots (MQD) were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer by combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.

         <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, was developed for visualizing intracellular viscosity change and immediately predicting therapeutic efficacy of tumour turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy.







Abstract
We present a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, for acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy (PTT), followed by viscosity based therapeutic efficacy evaluation by itself in two independent channels, denoted as &#8220;self&#8208;checking&#8221; strategy. In acidic TME, LET&#8208;1052 was protonated and turned on NIR&#8208;II absorption for PTT under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT&#8208;induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET&#8208;1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;I fluorescence for real&#8208;time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor&#8208;bearing mice for different periods of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, NIR&#8208;I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic reactions were developed to convert 19 phenolic derivatives containing halogen, nitro, and methyl substituents into eight D&#8208;luciferin analogues, including the novel compounds 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin and 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin, which emit brighter and longer&#8208;wavelength light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. These reactions enabled the further development of luminescence technology for the sensitive detection of organophosphate pesticides.







Abstract
D&#8208;Luciferin (D&#8208;LH2), a substrate of firefly luciferase (Fluc), is important for a wide range of bioluminescence applications. This work reports a new and green method using enzymatic reactions (HELP, HadA Enzyme for Luciferin Preparation) to convert 19 phenolic derivatives to 8 D&#8208;LH2 analogues with &#8776;51&#8201;% yield. The method can synthesize the novel 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 and 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2, which have never been synthesized or found in nature. 5&#8242;&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 emits brighter and longer wavelength light than the D&#8208;LH2. Using HELP, we further developed LUMOS (Luminescence Measurement of Organophosphate and Derivatives) technology for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos, and fenitrothion by coupling the reactions of OPs hydrolase and Fluc. The LUMOS technology can detect these OPs at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The method can directly detect OPs in food and biological samples without requiring sample pretreatment.

         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of (+)&#8208;euphorikanin A, an intriguing and complex diterpenoid, was achieved by using an intramolecular nucleophile&#8208;catalyzed aldol lactonization of carboxylic acid&#8211;ketone to assemble the five&#8208;membered ring, a McMurry coupling to construct the seven&#8208;membered ring, and a biomimetic benzilic acid type rearrangement to form the bridged [3.2.1]&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone moiety.

         <title>Unprecedented and Readily Tunable Photoluminescence from Aliphatic Quaternary Ammonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions are observed from the solids of aliphatic quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), with &#934;c and &lt;&#964;&gt;p of up to 14.7&#8201;% and 762&#8197;ms, respectively. By adjusting the alkyl chain length/counterions or through physical blending and grinding, multicolor emissions from blue to orange&#8208;red and white are realized, which enables advanced multimode anticounterfeiting for QASs.







Abstract
Compounds bearing aliphatic amines can be emissive under appropriate conditions. However, their ionized counterparts, namely, quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), which are widely used as phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, ionic liquids, disinfectants, and surfactants, are known as luminescence quenchers and considered nonemissive. Herein, unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions from various QASs are reported, which can be finely regulated by changing the excitation wavelength, alkyl chain length, counterion, and mechanical stimuli. The bright photoluminescence along with distinct afterglow and tunable multicolor emissions enables the application of QAS solids in advanced multimode anticounterfeiting. This finding refreshes the understanding of QASs and may inspire emerging applications based on the utilization of the intrinsic luminescences of QASs. Furthermore, it opens opportunities for the investigation of QAS&#8208;related processes and functions via a photophysical approach and affords strong implications for the fabrication of novel nonconventional luminophores.

         <title>Support&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Fibers as Multifunctional Microelectrodes for In Vivo Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS fibers and multifunctional microelectrodes based on them, which are mechanically compliant with neural tissues and exhibit significantly reduced foreign body responses, are developed not only for spatiotemporal neurochemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace in neural microcircuits, but also for neuromodulation by current&#8208;regulated electrostimulation.







Abstract
In vivo microelectrodes are essential for neuroscience studies. However, development of microelectrodes with both flexibility and multifunctionality for recording chemical and electrical signals in the same extracellular microspace and modulating neural activity remains challenging. Here, we find that pure PEDOT:PSS fibers (i.e., support&#8208;free) exhibit high conductivity, fast heterogeneous electron transfer, and suitable charge storage and injection capabilities, and can thus directly act as microelectrodes not only for chemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace, but also for electromodulation of neural microcircuit activity. Moreover, the microelectrodes mechanically match with neural tissues, exhibiting less foreign body responses. Given the multifunctionality, flexibility, and biocompatibility, the support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based microelectrodes offer a new avenue to microelectrode technology for neuroscience research, diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Static Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images Reveal the Mechanism of Supramolecular Polymerization of an Oligopyridine on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To be or not to be: The pressing question of the fundamental mechanism of two&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly processes, namely that of thermodynamic or kinetic control, is demonstrated using the example of a donor&#8211;acceptor oligopyridine on graphite. A statistical analysis of STM images and DFT calculations suggest that there is a significant contribution of kinetics similar to copolymerization in bulk.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of a donor&#8211;acceptor bisterpyridine (BTP) equipped with an electron&#8208;rich carbazole unit is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)|solution interface. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional crystals of supramolecular (co)polymers are formed by chain growth polymerization, which in turn can be described by copolymerization statistics. From concentration&#8208;dependent measurements, derived copolymerization parameters and DFT calculations, a mechanism for self&#8208;assembly is developed that suggests a kinetically driven polymerization process in combination with thermodynamically controlled crystallization.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane, an [n]cyclophane molecule bearing the largest polycyclic heteroarene, was synthesized via a strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The obtained azacorannulenophane shows unique structural and physical features, which provides important insights into the influence of &#960;&#8208;extension and strain from an aliphatic chain in polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the K&#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.

         <title>Alkylgold(III) Complexes Undergo Unprecedented Photo&#8208;Induced &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination and Reduction for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylgold(III) complexes containing glucose moieties were identified to undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and reduction, leading to cancer&#8208;selective cellular uptake, potent inhibition on thioredoxin reductase, up to 400&#8208;fold increase of cytotoxicity in vitro, and strong antiangiogenic and anti&#8208;tumor activities in two animal models.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controllable activation of prodrugs within tumors is highly desirable for cancer therapy to minimize toxic side effects. Herein we report that stable alkylgold(III) complexes can undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, releasing alkyl ligands and forming gold(III)&#8208;hydride intermediates that could be quickly converted into bioactive [AuIII&#8722;S] adducts; meanwhile, the remaining alkylgold(III) complexes can photo&#8208;catalytically reduce [AuIII&#8722;S] into more bioactive AuI species. Such photo&#8208;reactivities make it possible to functionalize gold complexes on the auxiliary alkyl ligands without attenuating the metal&#8211;biomacromolecule interactions. As a result, the gold(III) complexes containing glucose&#8208;functionalized alkyl ligands displayed efficient and tumor&#8208;selective uptake; notably, after one&#8208; or two&#8208;photon activation, the complexes exhibited high thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition, potent cytotoxicity, and strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities in vivo.

         <title>Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Multi&#8208;dimensional Liquid Chromatography with On&#8208;Line Deuterated Solvent Exchange for Streamlined Structure Elucidation at the Microgram Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Deuterated Multidimensional&#8208;Liquid Chromatography (TE&#8208;Dt&#8208;mDLC) for rapid microgram&#8208;scale structure elucidation by NMR is introduced. This concept enables a streamlined chemical characterization of multicomponent mixtures (e.g. catalysis, natural products) while bypassing tedious drying processes with recoveries above 90&#8201;% using as little as a few micrograms of material.







Abstract
At the forefront of chemistry and biology research, development timelines are fast&#8208;paced and large quantities of pure targets are rarely available. Herein, we introduce a new framework, which is built upon an automated, online trapping&#8208;enrichment multi&#8208;dimensional liquid chromatography platform (TE&#8208;Dt&#8208;mDLC) that enables: 1)&#8197;highly efficient separation of complex mixtures in a first dimension (1D&#8208;UV); 2)&#8197;automated peak trapping&#8208;enrichment and buffer removal achieved through a sequence of H2O and D2O washes using an independent pump setup; and 3)&#8197;a second dimension separation (2D&#8208;UV&#8208;MS) with fully deuterated mobile phases and fraction collection to minimize protic residues for immediate NMR analysis while bypassing tedious drying processes and minimizing analyte degradation. Diverse examples of target isolation and characterization from organic synthesis and natural product chemistry laboratories are illustrated, demonstrating recoveries above 90&#8201;% using as little as a few micrograms of material.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO/CH4 Using a Metal&#8211;Organic &#8220;Soft&#8221; Coordination Polymer Gel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based coordination polymer gel (CPG) has been developed for visible/sunlight&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Notably, the product of CO2 reduction can be modulated by changing the sacrificial electron donor (SED). Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG upon photocatalytic CO2 reduction produces CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in presence of TEA as SED), whereas in presence of both BNAH and TEA as SED, Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG produces CH4 (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity).







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a well&#8208;defined and astutely designed, low&#8208;molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker with a suitable metal ion is a promising method for preparing photocatalytically active coordination polymer gels. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and gelation behaviour of a tetrapodal LMWG based on a porphyrin core connected to four terpyridine units (TPY&#8208;POR) through amide linkages. The self&#8208;assembly of TPY&#8208;POR LMWG with RuII ions results in a Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR coordination polymer gel (CPG), with a nanoscroll morphology. Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG exhibits efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor. Interestingly, in the presence of 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) with TEA as the sacrificial electron donor, the 8e&#8722;/8H+ photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 is realized with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). In CPG, porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and covalently attached [Ru(TPY)2]2+ acts as a catalytic center as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Further, combining information from the in situ DRIFT spectroscopy and DFT calculation, a possible reaction mechanism for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 was outlined.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Molecular Species in Carbon Nanodot Samples Disclosing Flaws</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purification of carbon nanodots is a critical aspect in their preparation, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of organic molecules in the final sample can lead to mistaken conclusions regarding their properties. In this work, NMR is proven to be an essential technique to verify the purification of carbon nanodots, thanks to its ability to disclose molecular species.







Abstract
Carbon nanodots are currently one of the hot topics in the nanomaterials world, due to their accessible synthesis and promising features. However, the purification of these materials is still a critical aspect, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of unreacted species or small organic molecules formed during solvothermal treatments can affect the properties of the synthesized nanomaterials. To illustrate the extreme importance of this issue, we present two case studies in which insufficient purification results in misleading conclusions regarding the chiral and fluorescent properties of the investigated materials. Key to identify molecular species is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance, which proves to be an effective tool. Our work highlights the need to include nuclear magnetic resonance as a standard characterization technique for carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, to minimize the risk of observing properties that arise from molecular species, rather than the target carbon nanodots.

         <title>Overturned Loading of Inert CeO2 to Active Co3O4 for Unusually Improved Catalytic Activity in Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique overturned loading strategy for the preparation of Co3O4 nanocomposites by loading inert CeO2 onto active Co3O4 is described. Such a design generates abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Co and Ce as new active sites, resulting in unusually improved catalytic activity in both Fenton&#8208;like reaction and beyond, for instance, CO oxidation.







Abstract
In the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of nanocomposites by either exposing more active sites or regulating the interaction between the support and nanoparticles while keeping the structure of the active sites unchanged. Here, we report the fabrication of a Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposite via overturning the loading direction, i.e., loading an inert CeO2 support onto active Co3O4 nanoparticles. The resultant catalyst exhibits unexpectedly higher activity and stability in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reactions than its analog prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov with a Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ce structure instead of Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov) are generated as new active sites to facilitate the cleavage of the peroxide bond to produce SO4.&#8722; and accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, i.e., the desorption of SO4.&#8722;, affording improved activity. This strategy is a new direction for boosting the catalytic activity of nanocomposite catalysts in various scenarios, including environmental remediation and energy applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiazolidinethione (TZ) modified Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POMD) derivative (POMD&#8208;TZ) has been synthesized which can covalently modify &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. The inhibitory effect of POMD&#8208;TZ on A&#946; aggregation is much stronger than that of POMD, thus demonstrating the superiority of the chemical post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) method for the modification of traditional A&#946; inhibitors.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new approach to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs) were used as examples of inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation to illustrate the chemical PTM method. After the POMs were modified with thiazolidinethione (TZ), the resulting POMD&#8208;TZ acted as a chemical PTM agent and could covalently modify A&#946; site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method compared to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and a fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitive&#8221; probe. The use of PTM agents for the site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene Stabilized Disilicon(0) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex was synthesized and characterized, which revealed a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding. Its reaction with phenylacetylene gave the structurally interesting silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene and reveals new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino&#8208;substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2&#8197;equiv) in THF at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C leads to a silylene&#8208;ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60&#8201;% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si0 atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.

         <title>Rapid and Controlled Polymerization of Bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;Caprolactone toward Fully Recyclable Polyesters and Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P&#948;CL that was capable to recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers with excellent mechanical properties can be easily prepared by sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide.







Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents the controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of &#948;-caprolactone (&#948;CL) to produce high-molecular-weight P&#948;CL that was capable to recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Well-defined PLLA-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-P&#948;CL-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLLA triblock copolymers with excellent mechanical properties can be easily prepared by sequential ROP of &#948;CL and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lactide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end-of-use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time-consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of bio-sourced &#948;-caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lactide (&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-LA) affords well-defined PLLA-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-P&#948;CL-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-P&#948;CL-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Nanoarchitectonics of Bacteriorhodopsin for Enhancing ATP Generation in a FoF1&#8208;ATPase&#8208;Based Assembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ATP synthase into an artificial biomimetic system has enabled a cascade reaction under illumination and the synthesis of ATP. The approach based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electrostatic adsorption results in BR maintaining a highly uniform orientation with a high loading capacity and enhanced phosphorylation. The introduction of optically matched quantum dots led to the ATP production being further enhanced to 2.11 times.







Abstract
Energy conversion plays an important role in the metabolism of photosynthetic organisms. Improving energy transformation by promoting a proton gradient has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present study, we realize a directional proton migration through the construction of oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by FoF1&#8208;ATPase molecular motors through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) assembly. The changes in the conformation of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in a radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, optically matched quantum dots were introduced into the artificial coassembly system of BR and FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the use of light energy.

         <title>Unmasking the Critical Role of the Ordering Degree of Bimetallic Nanocatalysts on Oxygen Reduction Reaction by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the ordering degree of AuCu bimetallic catalysts were studied in&#8197;situ by a shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy satellite strategy and the molecular reaction mechanism is revealed.







Abstract
Precise control and accurate understanding of the ordering degree of bimetallic nanocatalysts (BNs) are challenging yet crucial to acquire advanced materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). AuCu BNs with various ordering degrees were synthesized to evaluate the influence of ordering degree on the ORR at a molecular level using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. The activity of AuCu BNs was improved by over 2&#8197;times after a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, making the performance of highly ordered AuCu BNs exceed that of benchmark Pt/C. Direct Raman spectroscopic evidence of key intermediate (*OH) demonstrates that the active site is the combination site of Au and Cu. Moreover, two distinct *OH species are observed on the ordered and disordered structure, and the ordered site is more beneficial for ORR due to its lower affinity to *OH. This work deepens the understanding on the important role of ordering degree on BNs and enables the design of improved catalysts.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxygenic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differential protein electrostatics enable excitation of the Photosystem&#8208;II reaction center chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pigment pairs by far&#8208;red light along two distinct, conformation&#8208; and wavelength&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transfer pathways.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II uses sunlight to trigger charge separation and catalyze water oxidation. Intrinsic properties of chlorophyll a pigments define a natural &#8220;red limit&#8221; of photosynthesis at &#8776;680&#8197;nm. Nevertheless, charge separation can be triggered with far&#8208;red photons up to 800&#8197;nm, without altering the nature of light&#8208;harvesting pigments. Here we identify the electronic origin of this remarkable phenomenon using quantum chemical and multiscale simulations on a native Photosystem&#8208;II model. We find that the reaction center is preorganized for charge separation in the far&#8208;red region by specific chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pairs, potentially bypassing the light&#8208;harvesting apparatus. Charge transfer can occur along two distinct pathways with one and the same pheophytin acceptor (PheoD1). The identity of the donor chlorophyll (ChlD1 or PD1) is wavelength&#8208;dependent and conformational dynamics broaden the sampling of the far&#8208;red region by the two charge&#8208;transfer states. The two pathways rationalize spectroscopic observations and underpin designed extensions of the photosynthetically active radiation limit.

         <title>Chemical Defect&#8208;Driven Response on Graphene&#8208;Based Chemiresistors for Sub&#8208;ppm Ammonia Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene leads to excellent sensitivity for ammonia. Quick response and recovery of the functionalized graphene layers are observed, and a sensitivity benchmarking with other graphene chemiresistors shows a superior sensitivity in the sub&#8208;ppm range.







Abstract
Gas sensors are essential in several fields and, in general, features such as high sensitivity, quick response, and fast recovery are required, along with low power consumption and low cost. Graphene is considered a promising material for gas sensing applications, its functionalization often being a requisite. In the present study, we developed competitive and promising gas sensors for ammonia detection. Interestingly, we present an easy and efficient method to functionalize graphene by using diazonium chemistry with different functional groups. Moreover, we prove the superior sensing capability of our covalently modified graphene layers. These experimental data have been consistently interpreted by theoretical calculations, which reveal a defect&#8208;driven sensor's response to ammonia. These results open the possibility of a comprehensive design and use of these graphene&#8208;based sensors in real applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as an Efficient Protection Layer for Stable Lithium&#8208;metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal shows great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal batteries are still challenged by the formation of Li dendrites and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on metallic Li. Herein, a thin covalent organic framework layer is  in&#8208;situ  fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate the side reaction on Li anode.  The COF has a periodic and uniform porosity, allowing for selectively sieving Li ions and guiding a uniform Li deposition. As a result, the COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendrite morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates  a remarkable cycle life over 13,200 h with an extremely low overpotential of only 16 mV at a high current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a high areal capacity of 10 mA h cm  &#8208;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Catalysts for Reductive Homocoupling of CO2 towards C2+ Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds via reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. While in the major part of the available studies heterogeneous metallic catalysts were employed, the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several works have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, i.e. the possibility for gaining a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This review summarizes the recent progress in both thermo&#8208; and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO2 toward C2+ products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for further conversion of intermediates from CO2 reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of Oppositely Charged Polymers Regulates Bioinspired Silicification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, simple organisms evolved mechanisms to form intricate biosilica nanostructures, far exceeding current synthetic manufacturing. Based on the properties of extracted biomacromolecules, polycation&#8208;polyanion pairs were suggested as moderators of biosilica formation. However, the chemical principles of this polymer&#8208;induced silicification remain unclear. Here, we used a biomimetic polycation&#8208;polyanion system to study polymer&#8208;induced silicification. We demonstrate that it is the polymer phase separation process, rather than silica&#8208;polymer interactions, which controls silica precipitation. Since ionic strength controls this electrostatic phase separation, it can be used to tune the morphology and structure of the precipitates. In situ cryo electron microscopy highlights the pivotal role of the hydrated polymer condensates in this process. These results pave the road for developing nanoscale morphologies of bioinspired silica based on the chemistry of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;containing molecular trefoil knots are fascinating ensembles that are usually covalently assembled, the latter requiring the rational design of di&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands as connectors. In this work, we describe the self&#8208;assembly of pentadecanuclear Au  I  trefoil knots [Au  15  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] from monoalkynes HC&#8801;CR (R = 9,9&#8208;X  2  &#8208;fluorenyl with X =  n  Bu,  n  &#8208;hexyl) and [Au  I  (THT)Cl]. Hetero&#8208;bimetallic counterparts [Au  9  M  6  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] (M = Cu/Ag) were self&#8208;assembled by reactions of [Au  15  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] with [Cu(MeCN)  4  ]  +  /AgNO  3  and HC&#8801;CR. The type of pentadecanuclear trefoil knots described herein is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS. [Au  9  Cu  6  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] is relatively stable in hexane; its excited state properties were investigated. DFT calculations revealed that non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, together with longer alkyl chain&#8208;strengthened inter&#8208;ligand dispersion interactions, govern the stability of the trefoil knot structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Overall Water Splitting by a Zirconium&#8208;Doped TaON&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;powered&#160;one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconducting materials is a simple means of achieving scalable and sustainable hydrogen production.  While tantalum oxynitride (TaON) is one of the few photocatalysts capable of promoting OWS via single&#8208;step visible light excitation, the efficiency of this process remains extremely poor. The present work employed 15 nm amorphous Ta  2  O  5  &#8226;3.3H  2  O nanoparticles as a new precursor together with Zr doping and an optimized nitridation duration to synthesize a TaON&#8208;based photocatalyst with reduced particle sizes and low defect densities. Upon loading with Ru/Cr  2  O  3  /IrO  2  cocatalysts, this material exhibited stoichiometric water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen, with an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency.  Our findings demonstrate the importance of inventing/selecting the appropriate synthetic precursor and of defect control for fabricating active OWS photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gold complexes can generate excimers ([Au  2  ]&#8594;[Au  2  ]*) and exciplexes ([Au  3  ]&#8594;[Au  3  ]*) with light excitation. Here, four Gd(III) and Y(III) complexes are assembled with dimeric {[Au(SCN)  2  ]  &#8208;  }  2  and trimeric {[Au(SCN)  2  ]  &#8208;  }  3  bis(thiocyanato)gold(I) counterions. The vibrational signature associated with Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Au vibrational mode is probed with ultra&#8211;low frequency (ULF) Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Emission spectroscopy is used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8211; and low&#8211;energy regions are associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8211;dependent luminescence measurements show that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green  via  cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as a colorimetric thermometer.

         <title>Short Guanidinium&#8208;Functionalized Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s Displaying Potent Therapeutic Efficacy on Drug&#8208;Resistant Fungal Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New antifungals are urgently needed to combat invasive fungal infections, due to limited types of available antifungal drugs and frequently encountered side effects, as well as the quick emergence of drug&#8208;resistance. We previously developed amine&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POXs) as synthetic mimics of host defense peptides (HDPs) to have antibacterial properties, but with poor antifungal activity. Hereby, we report the finding of short guanidinium&#8208;pendent POXs, inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, as synthetic mimics of HDPs to display potent antifungal activity, superior mammalian cells vs fungi selectivity, and strong therapeutic efficacy in treating local and systemic fungal infections. Moreover, the unique antifungal mechanism of fungal cell membrane penetration and organelle disruption explains the insusceptibility of POXs to antifungal resistance.   The    easy synthesis and structural diversity of POXs imply their potential as a class of promising antifungal agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric a&#8208;Allylation of Glycinate with Switched Chemoselectivity Enabled by Customized Bifunctional Pyridoxal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing  to the strong nucleophilicity of the NH  2  group, free&#8208;NH  2  glycinates react with MBH acetates to usually deliver N&#8208;allylated products even in the absence of catalysts. Without protection of the NH  2  group, chiral pyridoxal catalysts bearing an amide side chain at the C3 position of the naphthyl ring switched the chemoselectivity of the gylcinates from intrinsic N&#8208;allylation to a&#8208;C allylation. The reaction formed chiral multisubstituted glutamic acid esters as S  N  2'&#8208;S  N  2' products in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 86% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 97% ee). As compared to pyridoxal catalysts bearing an amide side arm at the C2 position, the pyridoxals in this study have a bigger catalytic cavity to enable effective activation of larger electrophiles, such as MBH acetates and related intermediates. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a cooperative bifunctional catalysis pathway, which accounts for the high level of diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol of the pyridoxal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design, Synthesis, and Photochemistry of Cy7PPG, an Efficient NIR&#8208;Activated Photolabile Protecting Group for Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photolabile Protecting Groups (PPGs) are molecular tools used, e.g., in photopharmacology for the activation of drugs with light, enabling spatiotemporal control over their potency. Yet, red&#8208;shifting of PPG activation wavelengths into the NIR range, which penetrates the deepest in tissue, has often yielded inefficient or insoluble molecules, hindering the use of PPGs in the clinic. To solve this problem, we report herein a novel concept in PPG design, by transforming clinically&#8208;applied NIR&#8208;dyes with suitable molecular orbital configurations into new NIR&#8208;PPGs using computational approaches. Using this method, we demonstrate how Cy7, a class of NIR dyes possessing ideal properties (NIR&#8208;absorption, high molecular absorptivity, excellent aqueous solubility) can be successfully converted into Cy7&#8208;PPG. We report a facile synthesis towards Cy7PPG from accessible precursors and confirm its excellent properties as the most redshifted oxygen&#8208;independent NIR&#8208;PPG to date (&#955;  max  = 746 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;Defensive Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new multifunctional construct M1 combining a floxuridine (FUDR) with a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor is presented. M1 targets the DNA damage response of cancer cells by inhibiting the PP2A activity and inducing mitochondrial and nucleus DNA damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis.







Abstract
We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.

         <title>Pure Boric Acid Does Not Show Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over 100&#8197;years, boric acid (BA) has been known to serve as an excellent glass matrix for luminescent chromophores. However, in contrast to a recent report, pure BA does NOT display RTP when excited at 280&#8197;nm, and it is demonstrated experimentally that it does not absorb at &#955;&gt;200&#8197;nm. Theoretical studies further reveal that pure BA cannot absorb at &#955;&gt;175&#8197;nm. Thus, an impurity must be responsible for the apparent RTP in the previous report.







Abstract
Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100&#8197;years. However, recently, apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9500) when irradiated at 280&#8197;nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)3 does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8211;400&#8197;nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &gt;175&#8197;nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &gt;200&#8197;nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &gt;250&#8197;nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP, whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.

Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &amp;gt;250&#8197;nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP, whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The globally rock&#8208;salt material AgSbSe2 is found to be locally distorted due to the off&#8208;centering of Sb atoms driven by a stereochemcally active 5s2 lone pair of electrons. This local off&#8208;centering plays an important role in suppressing the thermal propagation, resulting in ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in AgSbSe2.







Abstract
Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical for achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat&#8776;0.4&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic 
 direction by about &#8776;0.2&#8197;&#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained by density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitates the design of next&#8208;generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ON&#8208;OFF Switchable Hydrogenation Using a Molecular Shuttle Based on a [2]Rotaxane with a Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been applied to the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides. The hydrogenation can be switched ON/OFF efficiently by adjusting the movement of the rotaxane wheels with acid/base. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the formation of inactive RhIII&#8208;hydride species might be the reason for shutdown of the reaction.







Abstract
A novel pH&#8208;responsive molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been designed and synthesized. In the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides, ON/OFF&#8208;switchable catalysis was accomplished with high ON/OFF ratios by adjusting the movements of the rotaxane wheels located at the catalyst terminals with acid/base. Mechanistic studies using NMR spectroscopy and quasi in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that RhIII&#8208;hydride species are possibly formed in a H2 atmosphere when the catalyst is in the OFF state. During the reaction, a heterolytic activation of dihydrogen occurs by the interlocked rotaxane dibenzylamine and RhI catalytic center acting as a frustrated Lewis pair. Subsequent homolytic splitting of dihydrogen with the newly formed RhI&#8208;hydride species generates RhIII&#8208;hydride species. These findings show that a substrate&#8208;selective hydrogenation can be achieved by using the OFF&#8208;state catalyst.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials has been developed, which has led to the convenient synthesis of a new kind of macrocycle, namely calix[3]acridan. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed from calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% as a result of intense intermolecular charge transfer (ICT).







Abstract
A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8211;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90&#8201;% yield. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF properties due to intense intermolecular charge transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap of 0.014&#8197;eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% was achieved, and it represents the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor TADF materials.

         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isoelectronic cyclopropane analogues, namely NHC&#8208;stabilized diboriranes is described. Featuring van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry and highly strained B2C rings, the diborirane derivatives readily undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative functionalization, demonstrating potential for future applications in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of the parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives 3 and 4 with van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry. Species 3 and 4 are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B2C rings feature 2c&#8211;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in 3 are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane 5 and dichlorofluorenylborane 6, respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane 8 and selenaborirane 9. In addition, transfer hydrogenation of 3 with ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane 7 via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.

Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene, n&#8208;butyl acrylate or a mixture of both was carried out in water using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. Stable waterborne particles of vinylic polymers (red) bearing cleavable thioester units (blue) along the chains were obtained. The polymer chains were degraded to oligomers using a strong base (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) or isopropylamine.







Abstract
Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) were performed with n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions. Emulsion terpolymerization between DOT, BA and S allowed us to produce stable latexes not only composed of degradable chains but also featuring a broad range of glass transition temperatures.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Influenced Fragmentations in Free&#8208;Standing Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Hydrophobicity Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of the 3D&#8208;COF membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications is demonstrated. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane was utilized for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture.







Abstract
The ordered open organic frameworks membranes are attractive candidates for flow&#8208;assisted molecular separations. The physicochemical properties of such membranes mostly depend on their selectively chosen functional building blocks. In this work, we have introduced a novel concept of functional switchability of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes through a simple solvent&#8208;influenced fragmentation method. This room&#8208;temperature interfacial synthesis provides free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;COF membranes with distinct physicochemical properties from the same building monomers. Notably, the change of solvent from chloroform to ethyl acetate switches the membrane property from hydrophilic (water contact angle 60&#176;) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 142&#176;) nature. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane selectively passes oil molecules from an oil&#8211;water emulsion with a gravitational flux of 1536&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Microscopic Mechanism of the Heat&#8208;Induced Blueshift in Phosphors and a Logarithmic Energy Dependence on the Nearest Dopant&#8211;Vacancy Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A logarithmic relation governing the structures of phosphors was revealed together with an electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanism explaining the heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) phenomenon by using a high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles approach. The results shed new light on understanding the general structure problems of defect&#8208;containing systems, and the heat&#8208;induced phenomena of phosphors.







Abstract
Heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that has remained unexplained for decades. By using the high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations and energy&#8208;screening techniques, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+, Na[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, K[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+, and Ca[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+. Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal&#8208;cation vacancy. By identifying the 
 transition energies from the electronic structures calculated for the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu2+ ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.

         <title>Advancing the Development of Recyclable Aromatic Polyesters by Functionalization and Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of epoxides as building blocks enabled the preparation of a series of recyclable aromatic polyesters with functionalizable moieties, which has driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access of value&#8208;added materials. Stereocomplexed polymers were formed with enhanced thermal stability and crystallinity, and random copolymers displayed polyolefin&#8208;like mechanical performance.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic polymer systems to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. In this contribution, we prepared a class of aromatic cyclic esters (M1&#8211;M5) from thiosalicylic acid and epoxides by facile one&#8208;pot synthesis. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of Ms afforded aromatic polyesters P(M)s with high molecular weights and narrow dispersities. The physical and mechanical properties of P(M)s can be modulated by stereocomplexation and regulation of the side&#8208;chain flexibility of the polymers, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance properties such as high thermal stability and crystallinity (Tm up to 209&#8201;&#176;C), as well as polyolefin&#8208;like high mechanical strength, ductility, and toughness. Furthermore, the functionalizable moieties of P(M)s have driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access to value&#8208;added materials. More importantly, the P(M)s were able to selectively depolymerize into monomers in excellent yields, thus establishing its circular life cycle.

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control in cyclic polymer synthesis: Lewis pair polymerization controls where and when cyclization takes place to afford precision cyclic vinyl homo and block copolymers.







Abstract
In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (&#8776;1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemically fabricated conducting polymer membrane composed of polystyrene sulfonate anion doped polypyrrole matrices exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport. The asymmetric visible irradiation drove the cationic transport against a concentration gradient attributed to the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect.







Abstract
The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anion (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of the PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Hyperforin and Pyrohyperforin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of both (+)&#8208;hyperforin and its pyran congener (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin is described herein. The synthesis highlights a late&#8208;stage 1,3&#8208;diene diversification, including an abiotic cyclization cascade for pyran formation, and a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes.







Abstract
Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: 1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; 2) a HfCl4&#8208;mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; 3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and 4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalyst: Marked ORR Activity in Acidic Media without the Contribution from Metal Sites?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;doped hollow and hierarchically porous carbon nanocage catalyst having a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich layered heterostructure exhibits excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contributions by negligble amounts of Fe (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.%) owing to the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer and accelerated electron/mass transfer in the hierarchically porous structure.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be the most promising substitutes for benchmark Pt/C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report that N&#8208;doped carbon materials with trace amounts of iron (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) show excellent ORR activity and durability comparable and even superior to those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contribution by the metal sites. Such an N&#8208;doped carbon (denoted as N&#8208;HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich heterostructure providing the active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn&#8208;air battery using N&#8208;HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the maximum power density in the H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell reaches 486&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts at cathodes.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Immunity by a Ferrocene&#8208;Appended Iridium(III) Diphosphine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have potential as antitumor candidates. A ferrocene&#8208;modified IrIII complex with Fenton&#8208;like catalytic is used to disturb the cellular redox balance, which leads to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis of cancer cells. Ferroptosis induced by the IrIII complex causes immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cell in&#8197;vitro, which enhances cancer immune response in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway discovered in recent years, and ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have great potential as new antitumor candidates. Here, we report a IrIII complex (Ir1) containing a ferrocene&#8208;modified diphosphine ligand that localizes in lysosomes. Under the acidic environments of lysosomes, Ir1 can effectively catalyze Fenton&#8208;like reaction, produce hydroxyl radicals, induce lipid peroxidation, down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, and result in ferroptosis. RNA sequencing analysis shows that Ir1 can significantly affect pathways related to ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Accordingly, Ir1 can induce immunogenic cells death and suppress tumor growth in vitro, regulate T cell activity and immune microenvironments in vivo. In conclusion, we show the potential of small molecules with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities for effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Reductive Dimerization of Terminal Alkynes to 2,3&#8208;Dibranched Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a combination of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid proved successful in favoring the selective highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes over the competitive head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization pathway. The target reaction, proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate, presents a facile and straightforward approach for accessing 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes is described for the first time. Aromatic terminal alkynes bearing diverse and sensitive functional groups as well as aliphatic terminal alkynes are efficiently transformed to 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes. The key to achieve a selective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is to control appropriately the acidity of the reaction solution, which is accomplished by a combined use of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate under acidic conditions.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanobeacon for Monitoring the Fluctuation of Hydrogen Polysulfides during Fertilization and Embryonic Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluctuation of hydrogen polysulfide during the early embryonic development is revealed by a polymeric nanobeacon. A maximal level of H2Sn exists in the preliminary stage of embryogenesis, then the expression level of H2Sn was down&#8208;regulated with the development of the embryo.







Abstract
Fertilization and early embryonic development as the beginning of a new life are key biological events. Hydrogen polysulfide (H2Sn) plays important roles during physiological regulation, such as antioxidation&#8208;protection. However, no report has studied in situ H2Sn fluctuation during early embryonic development because of the low abundance of H2Sn and inadequate sensitivity of probes. We herein construct a polymeric nanobeacon from a H2Sn&#8208;responsive polymer and fluorophores, which is capable of detecting H2Sn selectively and of signal amplification. Taking the zebrafish as a model, the polymeric nanobeacon revealed that the H2Sn level was significantly elevated after fertilization due to the activation of cell multiplication, suppressed partially during embryonic development, and finally kept steady up to zebrafish emergence. This strategy is generally accessible for biomarkers by altering the responsive unit and significant for facilitating biological analysis during life development.

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable fabrication methods for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films are crucial for integrating this class of materials with applications. Reactive extrusion printing (REP) co&#8208;delivers reactive inks that rapidly form micron&#8208;thick interconnected nanoparticulate films of Cu3btc2 (HKUST&#8208;1) on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;location.







Abstract
Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2 (btc=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H3btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high&#8208;quality Cu3btc2 films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2 films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (  IHC  ) system to  in situ  construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the  IHC  system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of Methane: Examining the Inactivity of the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalyst at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) catalyzed by the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 has great industrial promise to convert methane directly to C2&#8208;3 products, but its high light&#8208;off temperature is the most challenging obstacle to commercialization and its working mechanism is still a mystery. We report the discovery of a low&#8208;temperature active and selective&#160;MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier, being capable of converting 23% CH4 with 72% C2&#8208;3 selectivity at 660 oC. From experiments and theoretical calculations, a large number of Q2 units in the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+ &#8596; Mn2+ redox cycle involved in the OCM reaction because of the easy formation of MnSiO3. Notably, the MnSiO3 formation proceeds merely through SiO2&#8208;involved reaction in the presence of Na2WO4: Mn7SiO12 + 6SiO2 &#8596; 7MnSiO3 + 1.5O2. The Na2WO4 not only drives the light&#8208;off of this cycle but also gets it working with substantial selectivity toward C2&#8208;3 products. Our findings shine a light on rational design of more advanced MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4 based OCM catalyst through establishing new Mn3+ &#8596; Mn2+ redox cycles with lowered light&#8208;off temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Lock Label Based on Thermosensitive Polymer Hydrogels for Information Camouflage and Multilevel Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double lock encryption strategy with both temperature and time as keys and excellent comprehensive capabilities has been established via a combination of lower critical and upper critical solution temperature (LCST and UCST) thermosensitive polymer hydrogels, of which the phase transition temperature and time can be arbitrarily tailored by changing the contents of monomer and crosslinker in their networks. This strategy provides powerful double insurances for confidential information.







Abstract
Developing extra safety encryption technologies to prevent information leakage and combat fakes is in high demand but is challenging. Herein, we propose a &#8220;double lock&#8221; strategy based on both lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer hydrogels for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. Two types of hydrogels were synthesized by the method of random copolymerization. The number of &#8722;CO&#8722;NH2 groups in the network structure of the hydrogels changed the enthalpic or entropic thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels, and ultimately precisely controlled their phase transition temperature. The crosslink density of the polymer hydrogels governs the diffusion kinetics, resulting in a difference in the time for their color change. The combination of multiple LCST and UCST hydrogels in one label realized information encryption and dynamic information identification in the dimensions of both time and temperature. This work is highly interesting for the fields of information encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and smart responsive materials.

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controlling the orderly disassembly of elemental sulfur (S8) in the presence of MTBD (a hindered organic base) and [PPN]SbF6 (an ammonium salt) is described for constructing polydisulfides by copolymerizing with episulfides. The &#8220;living polymerization&#8221; feature and good monomer compatibility of this copolymerization allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides with well&#8208;defined structures and excellent optical properties.







Abstract
The usage of elemental sulfur (S8) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S8 hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S8 to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S8, with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF6 ([PPN]+ is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living&#8208; polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.

         <title>Reversible Supramolecular Polymorphism in Solution and Solid Matrix by Manipulating Sidegroup Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible switching between supramolecular polymorphs offers a great way to introduce stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Supramolecular polymorphism is usually achieved through pathway complexity, or by exploiting solvent&#8208;solute interactions. But, steering a self&#8208;assembly along a specific pathway to form a kinetically&#8208;stable aggregate is not easy. Also, changing solvent to switch between polymorphs is impractical. We present a perylene bisimide molecule with  trans  &#8208;azobenzene sidegroup that assembles into three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct colors, morphologies, packing and aggregation mechanism. Optical absorption and FTIR spectroscopy reveal the importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between protic solvent and azo N that controls the planarity of the azobenzene group and influences molecular packing. This interaction can be further modulated using temperature, and solution pH to reversibly switch between the three polymorphs, in solution as well as in solid silica&#8208;gel matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;replication allows selection for dynamic kinetic stability in a system of competing replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the key characteristics of living systems are their ability to self&#8208;replicate and the fact that they exist in an open system away from equilibrium. Herein, we show how the outcome of the competition between two self&#8208;replicators, differing in size and building block composition, is different depending on whether the experiments are conducted in a closed vial or in an open and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8208;destruction regime. In the closed system, the slower replicator eventually prevails over the faster competitor. In a replication&#8208;destruction regime, implemented through a flow system, the outcome of the competition is reversed and the faster replicator dominates. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by a mass&#8208;action&#8208;kinetics model. These results represent one of the few experimental manifestations of selection among competing self&#8208;replicators based on dynamic kinetic stability and pave the way towards Darwinian evolution of abiotic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodaelectro&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective direct alkenylations with weak O&#8208;coordination enabled by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8211;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp  2  )&#8208;directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly&#8208;coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative  peri  C&#8211;H alkenylations of challenging 1&#8208;naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis  via  user&#8208;friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily&#8208;available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high&#8208;value, nitrogen containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Osmotic Energy Conversion Enabled by Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes with Record Output Power Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A vast amount of energy can be extracted from the untapped low&#8208;grade heat from sources below 100 &#176;C and the Gibbs free energy from salinity gradients. Therefore, a process for simultaneous and direct conversion of these energies into electricity using permselective membranes was developed in this study. These membranes screen charges of ion flux driven by the combined salinity and temperature gradients to achieve thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion. Increasing the charge density in the pore channels enhanced the permselectivity and ion conductance, leading to a larger osmotic voltage and current. A 14&#8208;fold increase in power density was achieved by adjusting the ionic site population of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The optimal COF membrane was operated under simulated estuary conditions at a temperature difference of 60 K, which yielded a power density of ~231 W m  &#8722;2  , placing it among the best performing upscaled membranes. The developed system can pave the way to the utilization of the enormous supply of untapped osmotic power and low&#8208;grade heat energy, indicating the tremendous potential of using COF membranes for energy conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt&#8208;Stabilized Silylzinc Pivalates for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbosilylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report the preparation of solid and salt&#8208;stabilized silylzinc pivalates from the corresponding silyllithium reagents via transmetalation with Zn(OPiv)  2  . These resulting organosilylzinc pivalates show enhanced air and moisture stability and unique reactivity in the silylative difunctionalization of alkenes. Thus, a practical chelation&#8208;assisted nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alkyl and benzylsilylation of alkenes has been developed, which provides an easy method to access alkyl silanes with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. Kinetic experiments highlight that the OPiv&#8208;coordination is crucial to improve the reactivity of silylzinc pivalates. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of druglike molecules and versatile modifications of the products illustrate the synthetical utility of this protocol.</dc:description>

Here, we show how the structural information of small synthetic molecules could be used to guide the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into diversified yet long&#8208;range ordered superstructures, enabling the information transfer across four or five orders of magnitude in length scale. We designed three perylene diimide (PDI) based isomers differing by their site&#8208;specific substitutions of methyl group, which were able to supramolecularly polymerize into diverse structures. Importantly, coassembly of these PDI isomers with nanoparticles (NPs) could produce diverse long&#8208;range ordered nanoparticle superstructures, including one&#8208;dimensional NPs chains, double helical NPs assemblies and two&#8208;dimensional NPs superlattices. Equally important, we demonstrate that the information originated from small molecules could diversify the functions of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with AIE characteristics was developed. MeTPAE can not only interact with HDACs to inhibit cell proliferation, but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment. The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.







Abstract
The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.

         <title>A TMEDA&#8211;Iron Adduct Reaction Manifold in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Historically, the role of TMEDA in iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling has been disputed due to a lack of insight into the iron species present during catalysis. In this report, low&#8208;temperature synthesis, freeze&#8208;trapped 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical&#8208;quenched GC analysis were utilized to identify highly reactive and selective TMEDA&#8208;ligated iron species responsible for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we expand the current molecular&#8208;level understanding of one of the most important and effective additives in iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Focusing on relevant phenyl and ethyl Grignard reagents and slow nucleophile addition protocols commonly used in effective catalytic systems, TMEDA&#8208;iron(II)&#8208;aryl intermediates are identified via in situ spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and detailed reaction studies to be a part of an iron(II)/(III)/(I) reaction cycle where radical recombination with FePhBr(TMEDA) (2Ph) results in selective product formation in high yield. These results differ from prior studies with mesityl Grignard reagent, where poor product selectivity and low catalytic performance can be attributed to homoleptic iron&#8211;ate species. Overall, this study represents a critical advance in how amine additives such as TMEDA can modulate selectivity and reactivity of organoiron species in cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Structural Basis for Chaperone&#8208;Independent Ubiquitination of Tau Protein by Its E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based structural investigation of the Tau&#8211;CHIP complex revealed a multi&#8208;domain, dynamic interaction that explains the origin of the multiple&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau operated by CHIP, as well as the ability of this ligase to modify Tau in the absence of chaperones.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer's disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site&#8208;resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi&#8208;domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hsp70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone&#8208;independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial superassembly strategy is used by Biao Kong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200240) to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites with tunable diameters, architectures and composition. Owing to their excellent photothermal conversion performance and unique nanostructures, the resulting nanoparticles can be utilized as NIR light triggered nanovehicles with controllably release of cargos.

Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) is needed for certain applications requiring tight spatial control and long wavelength excitation, but few examples of molecules exhibiting higher&#8208;order MPA exist.

         <title>Simultaneous Counting of Molecules in the Halo and Dense&#8208;Core of Nanovesicles by Regulating Dynamics of Vesicle Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doublet spikes induced by chaotropes (SCN&#8722;) are recorded from chromaffin vesicles opening during vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC). The 1st and 2nd peaks correspond to the oxidization of molecules from the halo and dense&#8208;core, respectively, allowing a molecular count to be obtained independently in these two nanoscopic compartments. The vesicles can be classified into three groups including NDCVs, immature large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs), and mature LDCVs.







Abstract
We report the discovery that in the presence of chaotropic anions (SCN&#8722;) the opening of nanometer biological vesicles at an electrified interface often becomes a two&#8208;step process (around 30&#8201;% doublet peaks). We have then used this to independently count molecules in each subvesicular compartment, the halo and protein dense&#8208;core, and the fraction of catecholamine binding to the dense&#8208;core is 68&#8201;%. Moreover, we differentiated two distinct populations of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) and quantified their content, which might correspond to immature (43&#8201;%) and mature (30&#8201;%) LDCVs, to reveal differences in their biogenesis. We speculate this is caused by an increase in the electrostatic attraction between protonated catecholamine and the negatively charged dense&#8208;core following adsorption of SCN&#8722;.

Versatile tertiary &#946;&#8208;boryl amides are prepared by conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes and carbamoyl chloride electrophiles.

Abstract
Synthesis of versatile &#946; tert&#8208;boryl amides is accomplished by conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes and carbamoyl chloride electrophiles. This reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion using a palladium catalyst in combination with MandyPhos. The addition of water results in enhanced chemoselectivity for the conjunctive coupling product relative to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling product. Transformations of the reaction products were examined as well as application to the synthesis of (+)&#8208;adalinine.

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile and large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalyst modified nanowires provides an innovative perspective for simple and stable construction of functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. Such nanosensors enable the sensitive and selective detection of diverse biomolecules, and for the first time achieve real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells.







Abstract
The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, the polar covalent tetrahedron [SO 2  (NH 2  ) 2  ] was revealed as a new deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;active unit according to the theoretical calculations. Furthermore, sulfamide consisting of the polar [SO 2  (NH 2  ) 2  ] units was confirmed as an excellent DUV NLO material. Since sulfamide realizes the optimal balance in the relationships among composition, structure, and properties, in addition to very short absorption of 160 nm, it achieves multiple optical performance records among the non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV NLO materials, including the strongest SHG efficiency (about 4 times that of KDP), the largest birefringence (obv.: 0.07@589.3 nm) and the shortest SHG wavelength predicted as 188 nm.

         <title>Supported Lanthanum Borohydride Catalyzes CH Borylation Inside Zeolite Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), catalyzed by a zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanum borohydride, provides the first demonstration of a promising alternative to late&#8208;metal catalysts. High turnovers and yield are achieved by selective grafting of lanthanum at Br&#248;nsted acid sites and limiting HBpin degradation. C&#8722;H bond activation, likely via the &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism, is probably the turnover limiting step.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanide La(BH4)x&#8208;HY30 catalyzes C&#8722;H borylation of benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), providing a complementary approach to precious, late transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylations. The reactive catalytic species are generated from La grafted at the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in micropores of the zeolite, whereas silanoate&#8208; and aluminoate&#8208;grafted sites are inactive under the reaction conditions. During typical catalytic borylations, conversion to phenyl pinacolborane (PhBpin) is zero&#8208;order in HBpin concentration. A turnover number (TON) of 167 is accessed by capping external silanols, selectively grafting at BAS sites, and adding HBpin slowly to the reaction.

         <title>Access to a Labile Monomeric Magnesium Radical by Ball&#8208;Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball&#8208;milling of a magnesium iodide precursor with K/KI gave a mononuclear Mg radical which is stabilized by a CAAC ligand. Although stable in the crystalline state, the complex decomposed rapidly in solution. According to calculations and EPR spectroscopy, most of the spin density is localized on the CAAC ligand.







Abstract
In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) was prepared (Am=tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of 1 in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball&#8208;milling of 1 with K/KI gave the low&#8208;valent MgI complex (Am)Mg&#8901;(CAAC) (2) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15&#8201;% yield. Although a benzene solution of 2 decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)2 (3) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8722;C distance of 2.056(2)&#8197;&#197; indicates strong Mg&#8722;CAAC bonding. Calculations and EPR measurements show that most of the spin density is in a &#960;* orbital located at the C&#8722;N bond in CAAC, leading to significant C&#8722;N bond elongation. This is supported by calculated NPA charges in 2: Mg +1.73, CAAC &#8722;0.82. Similar metal&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer was calculated for M0(CAAC)2 and [MI(CAAC)2+] (M=Be, Mg, Ca) complexes in which the metal charges range from +1.50 to +1.70. Although the spin density of the radical is mainly located at the CAAC ligand, complex 2 reacts as a low&#8208;valent MgI complex: reaction with a I2 solution in toluene gave (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) as the major product.

&lt;p&gt;Ball-milling of a magnesium iodide precursor with K/KI gave a mononuclear Mg radical which is stabilized by a CAAC ligand. Although stable in the crystalline state, the complex decomposed rapidly in solution. According to calculations and EPR spectroscopy, most of the spin density is localized on the CAAC ligand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was prepared (Am=&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuC(N-DIPP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DIPP=2,6-diisopropylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball-milling of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with K/KI gave the low-valent Mg&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex (Am)Mg&#8901;(CAAC) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15&#8201;% yield. Although a benzene solution of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8722;C distance of 2.056(2)&#8197;&#197; indicates strong Mg&#8722;CAAC bonding.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of nickel&#8208;based coordination networks with different pore environments was synthesized. These porous materials could be used for coal&#8208;bed methane purification with exceptional separation performance.







Abstract
The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provides a source of energy and helps offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH4/N2 mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named Ni(ina)2, Ni(3&#8208;ain)2, Ni(2&#8208;ain)2, and Ni(pba)2, (where ina=isonicotinic acid, 3&#8208;ain=3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, 2&#8208;ain=2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and pba=4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them, Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can effectively separate CH4 from N2 with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (&#8776;0.6 and 0.5&#8197;nm) and pore environment. Explicitly, Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest ever reported CH4/N2 selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH4 uptake (40.8&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH4/N2 separation performance of Ni(ina)2 is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH4/N2 ratios, Ni(ina)2 selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH4 (99&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations and CH4&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH4 molecules. Importantly, Ni(ina)2 has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH4 from coal&#8208;bed methane.

         <dc:description>
Multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with integrated capabilities of Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The resultant AgNW/leather nanocomposites show promising application potentials for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.







Abstract
Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The AgNWs penetrate the micro&#8208;nanoporous structures in the corium side of leather constructing highly&#8208;efficient conductive networks. The resultant flexible and mechanically strong AgNW/leather nanocomposites exhibit extremely low sheet resistance of 0.8&#8197;&#937;/sq, superior visual Joule heating temperatures up to 108&#8201;&#176;C at low supplied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V due to efficient energy conversion, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of &#8776;55&#8197;dB and outstanding piezoresistive sensing ability in human motion detection. This work demonstrates the fabrication of multifunctional AgNW/leather nanocomposites for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Helicenes by a Tailored Chiral Benzo[ghi]perylene Trisimide &#960;&#8208;Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are bound by a newly designed chiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold composed of a perylene trisimide, BINOL and terphenyl subunits. The superb enantiodifferentiation is observable by the naked eye due to the exciplex&#8208;type emission of the homochiral complex.







Abstract
Enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral molecules that lack specific interaction sites for hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions remains challenging. Here we introduce the concept of tailored chiral &#960;&#8208;surfaces toward the maximization of shape complementarity. As we demonstrate for helicenes it is indeed possible by pure van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions) to accomplish enantioselective binding. This is shown for a novel benzo[ghi]perylene trisimide (BPTI) receptor whose &#960;&#8208;scaffold is contorted into a chiral plane by functionalization with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL). Complexation experiments of enantiopure (P)&#8208;BPTI with (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;[6]helicene afforded binding constants of 10&#8201;700&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 550&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively, thereby demonstrating the pronounced enantiodifferentiation by the homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold of the BPTI host. The enantioselective recognition is even observable by the naked eye due to a specific exciplex&#8208;type emission originating from the interacting homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffolds of electron&#8208;rich [6]helicene and electron&#8208;poor BPTI.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion templation using polyoxometalates can be a very effective approach to construct large macrocycles that have unique solid&#8208;state and solution properties. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle selectively binds the Preyssler polyanion in solution. It forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex that shows ultrahigh solid&#8208;state proton conductivities (1.7&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 368&#8197;K and 90&#8201;% RH) thanks to the presence of an extended hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
The rational development of an anion templation strategy for the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8722; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through an extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair in Zeolite Cages for Alkane Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8722;H bond in H2 and C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes (n&#8805;3) can be activated by a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in zeolites. The FLP consisting of the hydrocarbon pool species (polymethylbenzenium, Lewis acid) and deprotonated zeolites (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;, Lewis base) is the common steady state of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) concept in homogeneous catalysis was extended to heterogeneous catalysis via the supramolecular system of FLP between deprotonated zeolite framework oxygens and confined carbocations in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions. In this FLP, the polymethylbenzenium (PMB+) functioned as the Lewis acid to accept an electron pair, and the deprotonated framework oxygen site acted as the Lewis base to donate an electron pair. This FLP theoretically demonstrated the ability to undergo H2 heterolysis and alkanes dehydrogenation, and this was further confirmed by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometer (GC&#8208;MS) catalytic experiments inside FLP&#8208;containing chabazite zeolites. All these findings not only bring new recognition to the carbocation chemistry in zeolite cages but also put forward a new reaction pathway as one part of MTO reactions.

         <title>NHC Catalysis for Umpolung Pyridinium Alkylation via Deoxy&#8208;Breslow Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC deoxy&#8208;Breslow catalysis offers new umpolung possibilities for electron&#8208;poor arene rings. NHC organocatalysis is largely restricted to aldehydes, with other electrophiles proving difficult to harness. It is shown that a pyridinium system can react successfully with an NHC, enabling intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with a Michael acceptor through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
Umpolung N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis of non&#8208;aldehyde substrates offers new pathways for C&#8722;C bond formation, but has proven challenging to develop in terms of viable substrate classes. Here, we demonstrate that pyridinium ions can undergo NHC addition and subsequent intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate. The alkylation demonstrates, for the first time, that deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediates are viable for catalytic umpolung of areniums.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Imprinting of the Helical Organization in Liquid&#8208;Crystal Networks Using Achiral Monomers and Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed to make cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks from achiral monomers by irradiation with circularly polarized light. This approach allows simultaneous control over the photoalignment of the mesogens and the photopolymerization of the network.







Abstract
Control over molecular motion is facilitated in materials with highly ordered nanoscale structures. Here we report on the fabrication of cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks by circularly polarized light irradiation, without the need for chiral dopant or plasticizer. The polymer network is obtained by photopolymerization of a smectic achiral diacrylate mesogen consisting of an azobenzene core and discrete oligodimethylsiloxane tails. The synchronous helical photoalignment and photopolymerization originate from the cooperative movement of the mesogens ordered in well&#8208;defined responsive structures, together with the flexibility of the oligodimethylsiloxane blocks. The resulting thin films show excellent thermal stability and light&#8208;induced memory features with reversible responses. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication of photo&#8208;patterned films of liquid&#8208;crystal networks with opposite helical senses. These findings provide a new method to make light&#8208;controllable chiroptical materials with exciting applications in optics and photonics.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of [3]Radialenes via [1+1+1] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction has been achieved on the Ag(111) surface to afford the aza[3]radialenes. The chlorine substituents in the isocyanides ensured the selectivity and orientational order of the products via the steric hindrance&#8208;directed molecular assembly.







Abstract
[3]Radialenes are the smallest carbocyclic structures with unusual topologies and cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electronic structures. Here, we report a novel [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of aza[3]radialenes on the Ag(111) surface, where the steric hindrance of the chlorine substituents guides the selective and orientational assembling of the isocyanide precursors. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we determined the atomic structure of the produced aza[3]radialenes. Furthermore, two reaction pathways including synergistic and stepwise are proposed based on density functional theory calculations, which reveal the role of the chlorine substituents in the activation of the isocyano groups via electrostatic interaction.

The switching mechanism of the system relies on the reversible conversion of the non&#8208;ionic spiropyrane (SP) to a zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) and can be controlled by adjusting the pH value and via light, resulting in a pH&#8208;dependent photoactivity: While the compound possesses a pronounced difference in surface activity between both forms under acidic conditions, this behavior is suppressed at a neutral pH level. The underlying switching processes are investigated in detail, and a thermodynamic explanation based on a combination of theoretical and experimental results is provided. This complex stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior enables remote&#8208;control of colloidal systems. To demonstrate its applicability, the surfactant is utilized for the pH&#8208;dependent manipulation of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Two Polymorphs of TiP4N8 Synthesized from Binary Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TiP  4  N  8  was obtained from the binary nitrides TiN and P  3  N  5  upon addition of NH  4  F as a mineralizer at 8 GPa and 1400 &#176;C. An intricate interplay of disorder and polymorphism was elucidated by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and the investigation of annealed samples. This revealed two polymorphs, that consist of dense networks of PN  4  tetrahedra (degree of condensation  &#954;  = 0.5) and either augmented triangular TiN  7  prisms or triangular TiN  6  prisms for  &#945;  &#8208; and  &#946;  &#8208;TiP  4  N  8  , respectively. The structures of TiP4N8  exhibit  body&#8208;centered tetragonal  (  bct  ) framework topology. DFT calculations confirm the measured bandgaps of  &#945;  &#8208; and  &#946;  &#8208;TiP  4  N  8  (1.6&#8211;1.8 eV) and predict the thermochemistry of the polymorphs in agreement with the experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Incorporated Mussel&#8208;Inspired Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)&#8208;Based Polymer Coating Offers Improved Antibacterial Activity and Cellular Mechanoresponse Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt (CoII) ions have been an attractive candidate for the biomedical modification of orthopedic implants for decades. However, limited research has been performed into how immobilized CoII  ions affect the physical properties of implant devices and how these changes regulate cellular behavior. In this study we modified biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) with terpyridine and catechol groups (PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA) to create a stable surface coating in which bioactive metal ions could be anchored, endowing the coating with improved broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  , as well as enhanced surface stiffness and cellular mechanoresponse manipulation. Strengthened by the addition of these metal ions, the coating elicited enhanced mechanosensing from adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating. This dual&#8208;functional PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA/Co surface coating offers a promising approach for improving clinical implantation outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional Selectivity to Olefins from Deoxygenation of Fatty Acids over an Intermetallic Platinum&#8208;Zinc Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct deoxygenation of long&#8208;chain fatty acids can produce both saturated alkanes (C  n  H  2n+2  ) and unsaturated olefins (C  n  H  2n  ). However, the selectivity to olefins via the decarbonylation route is relatively low because of the more favorable decarboxylation pathway. We present an atomically&#8208;ordered intermetallic PtZn alloy on carbon catalyst (PtZn/C) with a record&#8208;high total selectivity (97%) towards undecane (C  11  H  24  ) and undecene (C  11  H  22  ) from the deoxygenation of lauric acid (C  12  H  24  O  2  ). Interestingly, the selectivity to C  11  H  22  is as high as 67.0% on PtZn/C, which is significantly higher than that of 27.5% obtained on Pt/C counterpart under the same reaction condition. Characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the intermetallic PtZn alloy not only inhibits the decarboxylation route via enhancing the energy barrier of cleavage of &#8208;COO*, but also facilitates the decarbonylation route via decreasing CO desorption energy, and therefore switching the major product from alkanes to olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective functionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is challenging due to the difficulty to discriminate the enantiotopic faces. Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand. Catalytic alkynylations occurred with tunable Markovnikov and  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity to afford products containing acyclic tertiary or quaternary stereocenters &#946; to an amide. Combining a sequence of alkene isomerization and regioselective hydroalkynylation, we further realized an iridium catalyzed formal asymmetric conjugated alkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity is dictated the ligand structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous membranization in a silk&#8208;based coacervate protocell model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly crowded coacervate micro&#8208;droplets are useful protocell constructs but the absence of a physical membrane limits their application as cytomimetic models. Auxiliary surface&#8208;active agents have been harnessed to stabilize the coacervate droplets by irreversible shell formation but endogenous processes of reversible membranization have received minimal attention. Herein, we describe a dynamic alginate/silk coacervate&#8208;based protocell model in which membrane&#8208;less droplets are reversibly reconfigured into semipermeable coacervate vesicles by spontaneous self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic silk polymers at the droplet surface under non&#8208;neutral charge conditions in the absence of auxiliary agents. We show that membranization can be reversibly controlled endogenously by programming the pH within the protocells using an antagonistic enzyme system such that structural reconfigurations in the protocell microstructure are coupled to the trafficking of water&#8208;soluble solutes. Our results open new perspectives in the design of hybrid protocell models with dynamical structural properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Critical Role of Removing Impurities in Nickel Oxide on High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance&#160;enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells applying nickel oxide (NiOx) as hole transport layer (HTL) has been limited by impurity ions (such as nitrate ions). Herein, we have proposed a strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality NiOx  nanoparticles via ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). Experimental and theoretical results illustrate that the cation of ionic liquid can inhibit the adsorption of impurity ions on nickel hydroxide through strong hydrogen bond and low adsorption energy, thereby obtaining NiOx&#8208;IL HTL with high conductivity and strong hole&#8208;extraction ability. Importantly, the removal of impurity ions can effectively suppress the redox reaction between NiOx  film and perovskite film, thus slowing down the deterioration of device performance. Consequently, the modified inverted device shows striking efficiency exceeding 22.62%, and superior stability maintaining 92% efficiency at maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft Alloys Constructed with Distinct Mesoatoms via Self&#8208;Sorting Assembly of Giant Shape Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The packing structures of spherical motifs affect the properties of resultant condensed materials such as in metal alloys. Inspired by the classic metallurgy, developing complex alloy&#8208;like packing phases in soft matter (also called &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;) is promising for the next&#8208;generation superlattice engineering. Nevertheless, the formation of many alloy&#8208;like phases in single&#8208;component soft matter is usually thermodynamically unfavourable and technically challenging. Here, we utilize a novel self&#8208;sorting assembly approach to tackle this challenge in binary blends of soft matter. Two types of giant shape amphiphiles self&#8208;sort to form their discrete spherical motifs, which further simultaneously pack into alloy&#8208;like phases. Three unconventional spherical packing phases have been observed in these binary systems, including MgZn  2  , NaZn  13  , and CaCu  5  phases. It&#8217;s the first time that the CaCu  5  phase is experimentally observed in soft matter. This work demonstrates a general approach to constructing unconventional spherical packing phases and other complex superlattices in soft matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Stabilizing Point Mutation Enables High&#8208;Resolution Co&#8208;Crystal Structures of the Adenosine A2A Receptor with Preladenant Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The G protein&#8208;coupled adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) is an important new (potential) drug target in immuno&#8208;oncology, and for neurodegenerative diseases. Preladenant and its derivatives belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists displaying exceptional selectivity. While crystal structures of the human A2AAR have been solved, mostly using the A2A&#8208;StaR2 protein that bears 9 point mutations, co&#8208;crystallization with Preladenant derivatives has so far been elusive. We developed a new A2AAR construct harboring a single point mutation (S913.39K) which renders it extremely thermostable. This allowed the co&#8208;crystallization of two novel Preladenant derivatives, the polyethylene glycol&#8208;conjugated (PEGylated) PSB&#8208;2113, and the fluorophore&#8208;labeled PSB&#8208;2115. The obtained crystal structures (2.25 &#197; and 2.6 &#197; resolution) provide explanations for the high potency and selectivity of Preladenant derivatives. They represent the first crystal structures of a GPCR in complex with PEG&#8208; and fluorophore&#8208;conjugated ligands. The applied strategy is predicted to be applicable to further class A GPCRs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal&#8208;free photosensitizer&#8208;catalyst dyad (PS&#8208;CAT) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation.  PS&#8208;CAT  represents a prototype dyad comprising  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers.  PS&#8208;CAT  and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic investigations.

         <title>Reactivity Differences Enable ROS for Selective Ablation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to engineer selective photodynamic agents to surmount bacterial&#8208;infected diseases, especially Gram&#8208;positive bacteria remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed two examples of compounds for a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study where reactive differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Sulfur&#8208;replaced phenoxazinium (  NBS&#8208;N  ) mainly generates superoxide anion radical capable of selectively killing Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while selenium&#8208;substituted phenoxazinium (  NBSe&#8208;N  ) has a higher generation of singlet oxygen that can kill both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This difference was further evidenced by bacterial fluorescence imaging and morphological changes. Moreover,  NBS&#8208;N  can also successfully heal the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected wounds in mice. We believe that such reactive differences may pave a general way to design selective photodynamic agents for ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected diseases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a highly efficient atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bipyrroles bearing an N&#8208;N linkage from simple hydrazine and 1,4&#8208;diones. Further product derivatizations led to axially chiral bifunctional compounds with high potential in asymmetric catalysis. For this CPA&#8208;catalyzed double Paal&#8208;Knorr reaction, an intriguing Fe(OTf)  3  &#8208;induced enantiodivergence was also observed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanosensitizer Performs Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Reprogrammed Oxygen Metabolism for Cancer Radiotherapy Intensification and Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy (RT) was hampered by the limited oxygen in tumor, which could be potentiated via reprogramming oxygen metabolism and increasing oxygen utilization efficiency. Herein, a metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer (Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX) was integrated by an acid&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (polyethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;polydithiocarbamates, PEG&#8208;DTC) and a hafnium&#8208;chelated polyphenolic semiconducting polymer (Hf&#8208;PSP) in an amphiphilic polymer (poloxamer F127, PLX). Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX elicited a high imaging performance for precise RT and generated H2S to reduce cellular oxygen consumption rate via mitochondrial respiration inhibiting, which reprogrammed oxygen metabolism for tumor oxygenation improvement. Then, Hf&#8208;sensitization would fully utilize the well&#8208;preserved oxygen to intensify RT efficacy and activate immunogenicity. Such synergistic strategy of improvement in oxygenation and oxygen utilization would have a promising prospect in optimizing oxygen&#8208;dependent therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of a Cobalt Diketimide into an Elusive Cobalt Aryl Nitrenoid Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of (  Tr  L)Co (  Tr  L = 5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,9&#8208;(trityl)dipyrrin) toward various aryl azides was examined to elucidate the electronic structure and reactivity of dipyrrinato cobalt aryl nitrenoid complexes. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a Co  II  diketimide complex [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  and its reversible C&#8722;C bond cleavage to yield a monomeric Co nitrenoid complex (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ). Exposure of [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  to an excess amount of an H&#8722;atom donor cleanly affords the Co  II  anilide complex (  Tr  L)Co(NHC  6  F  5  ). The half&#8208;order decay of [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  via H&#8211;atom abstraction (HAA) reveals saturation kinetic behavior indicating a pre&#8208;equilibrium between [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  and (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ) prior to HAA. Furthermore, (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ) undergoes reductive coupling with another equivalent of azide to furnish the four&#8208;coordinate tetrazido complex (  Tr  L)Co(  &#954;  2  &#8208;N  4  (C  6  F  5  )  2  ), expulsion of a fluorine atom to afford (  Tr  L)CoF, and N&#8722;group transfer reactivity to PPh  3&#160;  .</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of long n&#8208;peri&#8208;acenes (n&#8208;PAs) is challenging as a result of their inherent open&#8208;shell radical character, which arises from the presence of parallel zigzag edges beyond a certain n value. They are considered as &#960;&#8208;electron model systems to study magnetism in graphene nanostructures; being potential candidates in the fabrication of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface formation of the largest pristine member of the n&#8208;PA family, i.e. peri&#8208;heptacene (n = 7, 7&#8208;PA), obtained on an Au(111) substrate under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Our high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy investigations, complemented by theoretical simulations, provide insight into the chemical structure of this previously elusive compound. In addition, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state of 7&#8208;PA, exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (Jeff) of 49 meV.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Hydroformylation of Propylene by Iodide&#8208;Assisted Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isobutanal is a high value bulk material that, in principle, could be produced with 100% atom&#8208;economy by isoselective hydroformylation of propylene with syngas.

The catalytic and preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate a key role of the iodide anions in both the catalytic activity and the isoselectivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Isobutanal is a high value bulk material that, in principle, could be produced with 100% atom-economy by isoselective hydroformylation of propylene with syngas. However, leading industrial Rh- and Co-catalyzed hydroformylation methods preferentially form n-butanal over the iso-product, and methods offering isoselectivity remain underdeveloped. Here we report an iodide-assisted Pd-catalyzed hydroformylation of propylene that produces isobutanal with unprecedented levels of selectivity. The method involves PdI2, simple alkyl monophosphines, such as tricyclohexylphosphine, and common green solvents, enabling the title reaction to occur with isoselectivity in up to 50:1 iso/n product ratios under industrially relevant conditions (80-120 &#959;C).

         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals.&#160;However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging.&#160;Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single&#8208;atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru  1  &#8208;NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru  1  &#8208;NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283 V at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , and an optimal 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single&#8208;atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*.&#160;Furthermore, Ru  1  &#8208;NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.</dc:description>

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Rhonin Targets RHOGDI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the discovery of novel chemical matter generally endowed with bioactivity strategies may be particularly efficient that combine previous insight about biological relevance, e.g., natural product (NP) structure, with methods that enable efficient coverage of chemical space, such as fragment based design. We describe the de novo combination of different 5&#8208;membered NP&#8208;derived N&#8208;heteroatom fragments to structurally unprecedented &#8220; pseudo&#8208;natural products&#8221; in an efficient complexity&#8208;generating and enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis sequence. The pseudo&#8208;NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure but occupy areas of chemical space not covered by NP&#8208;derived chemotypes, and may have novel biological targets. Investigation of the pseudo&#8208;NPs in unbiased phenotypic assays and target identification led to the discovery of the first small&#8208;molecule ligand of the RHO GDP&#8208;dissociation inhibitor 1 (RHOGDI1), termed Rhonin. Rhonin inhibits the binding of the RHOGDI1 chaperone to GDP&#8208;bound RHO GTPases and alters the subcellular localization of RHO GTPases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAAs, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes.

         <title>Assembling Metal Organic Layer Composites for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid the poor conductivity of most pristine metal&#8211;organic frameworks, a free&#8208;standing metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) was exploited to construct diverse composites by a facile post&#8208;synthetic strategy. The structural superiority of the MOLs composites contributes to the excellent and durable performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into formate.







Abstract
2D metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Herein, a freestanding metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with a 2D kgd (kagome dual) lattice was constructed with abundant surface oxygenate groups serving as anchoring sites to immobilize diverse guests. Taking Bi as an example, tetragonal Bi2O3 nanowires can be uniformly grown on MOLs after solvothermal treatment, the structural evolution of which was followed by ex&#8197;situ electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Bi2O3/MOL exhibits excellent CO2 electroreduction activity towards formate reaching a specific current of 2.3&#8197;A&#8201;mgBi&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiencies of over 85&#8201;% with a wide potential range from &#8722;0.87 to &#8722;1.17&#8197;V, far surpassing Bi2O3/UiO (a 3D Zr6&#8208;oxo based MOF) and Bi2O3/AB (Acetylene Black). Such a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy can be flexibly extended to develop versatile MOL composites, highlighting the superiority of optimizing MOL&#8208;based composites for electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the poor conductivity of most pristine metal&#8211;organic frameworks, a free-standing metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) was exploited to construct diverse composites by a facile post-synthetic strategy. The structural superiority of the MOLs composites contributes to the excellent and durable performance of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into formate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D metal&#8211;organic-framework (MOF) based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Herein, a freestanding metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with a 2D &lt;i&gt;kgd&lt;/i&gt; (kagome dual) lattice was constructed with abundant surface oxygenate groups serving as anchoring sites to immobilize diverse guests. Taking Bi as an example, tetragonal Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires can be uniformly grown on MOLs after solvothermal treatment, the structural evolution of which was followed by ex&#8197;situ electron microscopy. The as-prepared Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MOL exhibits excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction activity towards formate reaching a specific current of 2.3&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Bi&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Faradaic efficiencies of over 85&#8201;% with a wide potential range from &#8722;0.87 to &#8722;1.17&#8197;V, far surpassing Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/UiO (a 3D Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-oxo based MOF) and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/AB (Acetylene Black). Such a post-synthetic modification strategy can be flexibly extended to develop versatile MOL composites, highlighting the superiority of optimizing MOL-based composites for electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Molecular Cascade Reactions by a Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control of molecular cascade reactions has been demonstrated by a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA). It provided a complex dynamic model system for mimicking the natural processes and introduced the fundamental concepts to the field of systems chemistry.







Abstract
Inspired by efficient biomolecular reactions in the cell, versatile DNA nanostructures have been explored for manipulating the spatial position and regulating reactions at the molecular level. Spatially controlled arrangement of molecules on the artificial scaffolds generally leads to enhanced reaction activities. Especially, the rich toolset of dynamic DNA nanostructures provides a potential route towards more sophisticated and vigorous regulation of molecular reactions. Herein, a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA) as a dynamic scaffold was adopted in this work for temporal&#8208;controlled and switchable molecular cascade reactions. Dynamic regulation of the assembly of G&#8208;quadruplex, hybridization of parallel&#8208;stranded duplex and assembly of binary DNAzyme were demonstrated. Molecular cascade reactions on the triggered reconfiguration of DODAs were realized, resulting in more complex, dynamic, and switchable control over the reactions.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry Enabled High&#8208;Performance Iodide&#8208;Ion Conversion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inter&#8208;halogen strategy for non&#8208;negative halogen fixation to fully activate and stabilize the unrealized I0/I+ redox via electrolyte modification, leading to two&#8208;electron redox chemistry has been demonstrated. An unprecedented high voltage plateau, capacity, and energy density were obtained with our strategy, which may also particularly advance iodine redox chemistry.







Abstract
A single&#8208;electron transfer mode coupled with the shuttle behavior of organic iodine batteries results in insufficient capacity, a low redox potential, and poor cycle durability. Sluggish kinetics are well known in conventional lithium&#8211;iodine (Li&#8722;I) batteries, inferior to other conversion congeners. Herein, we demonstrate new two&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I&#8722;/I+ with inter&#8208;halogen cooperation based on a developed haloid cathode. The new iodide&#8208;ion conversion battery exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;art capacity of 408&#8197;mAh&#8201;gI&#8722;1 with fast redox kinetics and superior cycle stability. Equipped with a newly emerged 3.42&#8197;V discharge voltage plateau, a recorded high energy density of 1324&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgI&#8722;1 is achieved. Such robust redox chemistry is temperature&#8208;insensitive and operates efficiently at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. With systematic theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the formation of Cl&#8722;I+ species and their functions are clarified.

         <title>Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D helix adopted by a non&#8208;symmetric substituted poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated, and its ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres or fiber&#8208;like structures under the right conditions is also demonstrated. Moreover, by conformational changes in the pendant group it is possible to produce a helix inversion in the PDPA and create a circular polarized luminescence (CPL) switch.







Abstract
The secondary structure of a dissymmetric and chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated by combining the data from NMR experiments (regioregular head to tail structure), Raman and IR studies (E configuration of the polyene double bonds), and high&#8208;resolution AFM images (helical pitch, packing angle and orientation of the external helix). As a result, an E&#8208;transoidal polyene backbone describing three coaxial helices is obtained. Theoretical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies of the structure show a good correspondence between experimental and theoretical data and allow one to decipher that the first Cotton band is generated by the poly(diphenylacetylene) core and not only by the polyene backbone. The dynamic behavior of poly&#8208;(S)&#8208;2 is also demonstrated by a helix inversion effect produced by conformational changes at the pendant groups when annealed in solvents with different donor abilities. This phenomenon is accompanied by an inversion of the circular polarized luminescence of the PDPA (CPL switch).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Band&#8208;Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Bi3+/Te4+ Emitters in Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Cs2SnCl6 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doping was developed to achieve dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emission in perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals with a quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Solid evidence including the transition in photoluminescence lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was provided to unravel the photoluminescence originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+/Te4+.







Abstract
Luminescent metal halides have attracted considerable attention in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting because of their superior optical properties and easy solution processibility. Herein, we report a new class of highly efficient and dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emitters based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doped perovskite derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals. Owing to the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling and efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Te4+, the microcrystals exhibited broad dual&#8208;band white&#8208;light emission originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+ and Te4+, with good stability and a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Specifically, a remarkable transition in Bi3+&#8208;PL lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was observed, as solid evidence for the isolated Bi3+ emission. These findings provide not only new insights into the excited&#8208;state dynamics of Bi3+ and Te4+ in Cs2SnCl6, but also a general approach to achieve single&#8208;composition white&#8208;light emitters based on lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal ion co&#8208;doping.

These findings provide not only new insights into the excited-state dynamics of Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, but also a general approach to achieve single-composition white-light emitters based on lead-free metal halides through ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-metal ion co-doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Assisted Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones using Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones via visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in the presence of HFIP solvent. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to acrylamide derivatives furnishes an essential class of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing oxindole scaffolds. A high level of DFT calculations strongly supports our proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
A visible light photoredox catalytic method for the selective cleavage of single strong C&#8722;F bond in trifluoromethyl ketones is reported. Single electron reduction of trifluoromethyl ketones generates difluoromethyl radicals which can be engaged in intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides to furnish fluorine&#8208;containing oxindole derivatives in good yields. The reaction shows excellent chemoselectivity with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent plays a critical role for the selective single C&#8722;F bond cleavage. High&#8208;level DFT calculations are depicted to shed light on the mechanism.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescent Probe Allows Simultaneous Imaging of Main and Papain&#8208;like Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Infected Cells for Accurate Detection and Rapid Inhibitor Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
The simultaneous visualization of crucial proteases within SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected cells can be a significant benefit for the accurate detection of virus and rapid screening of inhibitors as well as for understanding the viral lifecycle. The catalytic efficiency, intracellular enzyme activity, and distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease and papain&#8208;like protease have now been exploited using peptide&#8208;based dual&#8208;color FRET probes and their inhibitors.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) and papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) play critical roles in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication and are promising targets for antiviral inhibitors. The simultaneous visualization of Mpro and PLpro is extremely valuable for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and rapid inhibitor screening. However, such a crucial investigation has remained challenging because of the lack of suitable probes. We have now developed a dual&#8208;color probe (3MBP5) for the simultaneous detection of Mpro and PLpro by fluorescence (or F&#246;rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). This probe produces fluorescence from both the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores that are cleaved by Mpro and PLpro. 3MBP5&#8208;activatable specificity was demonstrated with recombinant proteins, inhibitors, plasmid&#8208;transfected HEK 293T cells, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected TMPRSS2&#8208;Vero cells. Results from the dual&#8208;color probe first verified the simultaneous detection and intracellular distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro and PLpro. This is a powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of different proteases with value for the rapid screening of inhibitors.

         <title>Isospecific (Co)polymerization of Unmasked Polar Styrenes by Neutral Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes by neutral racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal catalysts affords perfect isotactic functional polystyrenes. Furthermore, the copolymerization of styrene with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrene produces gradient and random copolymer, respectively. The poison effect of the polar group on the catalysts is dramatically reduced by fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment around the active species.







Abstract
Syndioselective polymerization of unprotected polar styrenes has achieved great success via specially designed catalysts and the establishment of &#8220;self&#8208;assisted&#8221; theory. In contrast, isospecific polymerization of polar styrenes has remained less explored. Herein, we present new racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal complexes and their high activity and perfect isoselectivity (mmmm&gt;99&#8201;%) for the polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes without any activators. Moreover, the copolymerizations of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrenes with styrene give gradient and random copolymers, respectively. The insertion rate of polar monomers could be readily tuned in the range of 0&#8211;100&#8197;mol&#8201;% by changing their loading ratios. The resultant isotactic polar polystyrenes are quantitatively transformed into hydroxyl or methylsulfonyl polystyrenes with high Tgs. DFT calculations reveal the isospecific mechanism.

         <title>Crosslinked Polypeptide Films via RAFT&#8208;Mediated Continuous Assembly of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research into polypeptide films extends beyond polypeptide characterization into their fabrication. Herein, we report the novel fabrication of chemically crosslinked polypeptide films using reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Secondary structure analysis reveals unusually high random coil formation and such films further demonstrate biodegradability useful for tissue engineering and drug delivery.







Abstract
Polypeptide coatings are a cornerstone in the field of surface modification due to their widespread biological potential. As their properties are dictated by their structural features, subsequent control thereof using unique fabrication strategies is important. Herein, we report a facile method of precisely creating densely crosslinked polypeptide films with unusually high random coil content through continuous assembly polymerization via reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (CAP&#8208;RAFT). CAP&#8208;RAFT was fundamentally investigated using methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;lysine (PLLMA) and methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;glutamic acid (PLGMA). Careful technique refinement resulted in films up to 36.1&#177;1.1&#8197;nm thick which could be increased to 94.9&#177;8.2&#8197;nm after using this strategy multiple times. PLLMA and PLGMA films were found to have 30&#8211;50&#8201;% random coil conformations. Degradation by enzymes present during wound healing reveals potential for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.

         <title>A General Access Route to High&#8208;Nuclearity, Metal&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>

Controlled thermal treatment of the common decavanadate cluster in the solid state yields a universal precursor for the synthesis of large, metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadates, as demonstrated for three examples.







Abstract
Molecular metal oxides are key materials in diverse fields like energy storage and conversion, molecular magnetism and as model systems for solid&#8208;state metal oxides. To improve their performance and increase the variety of accessible motifs, new synthetic approaches are necessary. Herein, we report a universal, new precursor to access different metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters. The precursor is synthesized by a novel solid&#8208;state thermal treatment procedure. Solution&#8208;phase test reactions at room temperature and pressure show that reaction of the precursor with various metal nitrate salts gives access to a range of metal&#8208;functionalized POVs. The first nitrate&#8208;templated molecular calcium vanadate cluster is reported. We show that this precursor could open new access routes to POV components for molecular magnetism, energy technologies or catalysis.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Activatable DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Enables Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By programming multi&#8208;functional sequences in one ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chain and using it as the scaffold, we developed a lysosomal proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem, which overcomes the countervailing effect of Mn2+ on Cas9 and DNAzyme, and thus achieves efficient co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for combined gene therapy of breast cancer.







Abstract
CRISPR/Cas9 is emerging as a platform for gene therapeutics, and the treatment efficiency is expected to be enhanced by combination with other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem that enables co&#8208;delivery of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme for the combined gene therapy of cancer. Ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chains, which contained the recognition sequences of sgRNA in Cas9/sgRNA, DNAzyme sequence and HhaI enzyme cleavage site, were synthesized as the scaffold of the nanosystem. The DNAzyme cofactor Mn2+ was used to compress DNA chains to form nanoparticles and acid&#8208;degradable polymer&#8208;coated HhaI enzymes were assembled on the surface of nanoparticles. In response to protons in lysosome, the polymer coating was decomposed and HhaI enzyme was consequently exposed to recognize and cut off the cleavage sites, thus triggering the release of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme to regulate gene expressions to achieve a high therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer.

         <title>Carbonylative Polymerization of Epoxides Mediated by Tri&#8208;metallic Complexes: A Dual Catalysis Strategy for Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalysis strategy via carboxylate species featuring weak nucleophilicity and basicity is used for the direct carbonylative polymerization of various epoxides for the production of original advanced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with high molecular weight and tunable functionalization. This study represents a rare example of PHAs synthesis using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of commercially manufactured biodegradable polyesters with properties suitable for partially substituting petroleum&#8208;based plastics. However, high costs and low volumes of production have restricted their application as commodity materials. In this study, tri&#8208;metallic complexes were developed for carbonylative polymerization via a dual catalysis strategy, and 17 products of novel PHAs with up to 38.2&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 Mn values were discovered. The polymerization proceeds in a sequential fashion, which entails the carbonylative ring expansion of epoxide to &#946;&#8208;lactone and its subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization that occurs selectively at the O&#8208;alkyl bond via carboxylate species. The wide availability and structural diversity of epoxide monomers provide PHAs with various structures, excellent functionalities, and tunable properties. This study represents a rare example of the preparation of PHAs using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.

         <title>Selective Fluoromethyl Couplings of Alkynes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and BrCF2H or ICH2F in the presence of zinc is described. This process is based on a nickel&#8208;mediated radical addition/fluoromethyl coupling domino strategy and provides selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H&#8208; and CH2F&#8208;substituted alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We describe here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and fluoromethyl halides (BrCF2H and ICH2F) in the presence of zinc, enabling the facile and selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, merging intramolecular radical cyclization with fluoromethyl coupling enables the expedient constructions of CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated lactones and lactams with high efficiency and selectivity. Mechanistic studies disclose that this catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical addition to an alkyne followed by selective coupling with the fluoromethyl unit.

         <title>Upgrading Carbonate Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;stable Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNO3 is reported to dissolve at concentrations up to 0.7&#8197;M in ethylene carbonate (EC) without need for additives. We show further that various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes can be upgraded with LiNO3 to yield practical batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a widely used salt&#8208;additive that markedly improves the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at a Li metal anode but is generally regarded as incompatible with alkyl carbonates. Here we find that contrary to common wisdom, cyclic carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate can dissolve up to 0.7&#8197;M LiNO3 without any additives, largely improving the anode reversibility. We demonstrate the significance of our findings by upgrading various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes with LiNO3, which provides large improvements in batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes. Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach towards practical LMBs.

Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost-effective approach towards practical LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Step Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Switching in BiOIO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching has been achieved in polar BiOIO3, by using an in situ high&#8208;pressure polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurement system. The step&#8208;wise suppression of the lone&#8208;pair electrons on I5+ cations has been demonstrated to be responsible for the switching phenomenon in BiOIO3, and materials with multi&#8208;stabilities are crucial to next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.







Abstract
Materials with multi&#8208;stabilities controllable by external stimuli have potential for high&#8208;capacity information storage and switch devices. Herein, we report the observation of pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching in polar BiOIO3 for the first time. Structure analyses reveal two pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions in BiOIO3 from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;off). The three&#8208;state SHG switching was inspected by in&#8197;situ high&#8208;pressure powder SHG and polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the in&#8197;situ Raman spectra and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching is caused by the step&#8208;wise suppression of lone&#8208;pair electrons on the [IO3]&#8722; units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO3. Materials with switchable multi&#8208;stabilities provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;art platform for next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.

         <title>A Topologically Engineered Gold Island for Programmed In Vivo Stem Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated processing chain of therapeutic cells based on topologically engineered ligands, nuclease&#8208;mimic artificial enzyme and tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field is constructed. The integration of multiple functional components guides stem cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation detachment, in&#8197;situ magnetic labeling and retention at the implantation site, thus allowing programmed stem cell manipulation in vivo over prolonged time.







Abstract
Even a well&#8208;designed system can only control stem cell adhesion, release, and differentiation, while other cell manipulations such as in&#8197;situ labeling and retention in target tissues, are difficult to achieve in the same system. Herein, native ligand cluster&#8208;mimicking islands, composed of topologically engineered ligand, anchoring point AuNP, nuclease mimetics CeIV complexes and magnetic core Fe3O4, are designed to facilitate comprehensive cell manipulations in a programmable manner. Three islands with different amounts of AuNPs are constructed, which means tunable interligand spacing within a cluster. These nanostructures are chemically coupled to a substrate using DNA tethers. Under a tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field, this integrated system promotes stem cell adhesion, proliferation, mechanosensing, differentiation, detachment, in&#8197;situ effective magnetic labeling and retention both in vitro and in vivo, offering fascinating opportunities for a biomimetic matrix in regenerative medicine.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for In&#8197;Vivo Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent hydrogen probe was developed for the first time by a catalytic hydrogenation strategy, enabling efficient detection of hydrogen molecules in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro with high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, in favor of uncovering and understanding underlying biological behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules.







Abstract
To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. A catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed the super&#8208;high transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cells, animals and plants, and discovered in&#8197;vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.

A new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts in one step via cascade reactions of easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles was developed.

Abstract
Imidazolium salts have ubiquitous applications in energy research, catalysis, materials and medicinal sciences. Here, we report a new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts from easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes in one step. The strategy relies on a discovered family of unprecedented nucleophilic addition/cyclization reactions with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles. To probe general areas of application, synthesized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors were feasible for direct metallation to give functionalized M/carbene complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au), which were isolated in individual form. The utility of the chloromethyl function for the postmodification of the synthesized salts and Pd/carbene complexes was demonstrated. The obtained complexes and imidazolium salts demonstrated good activities in Pd&#8208; or Ni&#8208;catalyzed model cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H activation reactions.

The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. Herein, a dynamic boronic ester based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the creation of programmable and transient supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with tunable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and self&#8208;healing properties.







Abstract
The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. By using boronic ester based dynamic covalent chemistry and coupling it with an internal pH feedback system, we have developed a new chemically fueled reaction network for non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with programmable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be controlled by the kinetically controlled in&#8197;situ formation and dissociation of dynamic boronic ester bonds between the cis&#8208;diol of guanosine (G) and 5&#8208;fluorobenzoxaborole (B) in the presence of chemical fuels (KOH and 1,3&#8208;propanesultone), thereby leading to a precipitate&#8208;solution&#8208;gel&#8208;precipitate cycle under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach showed the underlying mechanism of the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly involves aggregation and disaggregation of right&#8208;handed helical G&#8208;quadruplex superstructures. The proposed dynamic boronic ester&#8208;based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy offers a new option to design next&#8208;generation adaptive and interactive smart materials.

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics.







Abstract
Using a mechanism&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free tandem catalytic approach, commodity polyester plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are rapidly and selectively deconstructed by combining the two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C, under 1&#8197;atm H2, affording terephthalic acid (or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid for PEN) and ethane (or butane for PBT) in essentially quantitative yield. This process is effective for both laboratory grade and waste plastics, and comingled polypropylene remains unchanged. Combined experimental and DFT mechanistic analyses indicate that Hf(OTf)4 catalyzes a mildly exergonic retro&#8208;hydroalkoxylation reaction in which an alkoxy C&#8722;O bond is first cleaved, yielding a carboxylic acid and alkene, and this process is closely coupled to an exergonic olefin hydrogenation step, driving the overall reaction forward.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Shape&#8208;Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Boronic Ester Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) exhibiting mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable properties were synthesized by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer networks. This research shines new light onto the development of dynamic covalent polymers for emerging applications in areas of bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optics and smart soft robotics.







Abstract
Endowing a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) exhibiting a helicoidal nanostructure with dynamically tailorable functionalities is of paramount significance for its emerging applications in diverse fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. Here, a mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable CLCE is judiciously designed and synthesized through integrating dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer network. The circularly polarized reflection of CLCEs can be reversibly and dynamically tuned across the entire visible spectrum by mechanical stretching. Thanks to the introduction of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the CLCEs were found to show robust reprogrammable and self&#8208;healing capabilities. The research disclosed herein can provide new insights into the development of 4D (color and 3D shape) programmable photonic actuators towards bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optical systems, and next&#8208;generation intelligent machines.

         <title>Surface Engineering Assisted Size and Structure Modulation of Gold Nanoclusters by Ionic Liquid Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid cations are deployed to regulate the size and structure of AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. Upon mild reduction, such AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes can be easily converted into desired AuI&#8208;thiolate protecting motifs, selectively producing atomically precise gold nanoclusters with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry.







Abstract
Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize the desired Au0 core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Featured Supramolecular Tubisomes for Imaging&#8208;Guided Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured cylindrical polymeric nanoparticles (tubisomes) are obtained from the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic cyclic peptide polymer conjugate. Intriguingly, encapsulation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can inactivate the fluorescence of both tubisome and DOX due to the energy transfer relay (ETR). The release of DOX can interrupt the ETR effect and light up the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ visualization of drug release.







Abstract
Polymeric cylinders, a fascinating type of nanostructures with high surface area, internal volume and rigidity, have been exploited as novel drug delivery vehicles over the past decade. However, it's still an open challenge to afford cylindrical nanostructures using polymeric building blocks via traditional self&#8208;assembly processes. Herein, we report a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy of preparing cylindrical aggregates (tubisomes) from an amphiphilic supramolecular bottlebrush polymer in which a cyclic peptide nanotube is employed as the noncovalent backbone. Additionally, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect was introduced into the tubisomes to endow them with excellent fluorescent properties. Intriguingly, by encapsulating with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), both the fluorescence of tubisome and DOX can be quenched due to the energy transfer relay (ETR) effect. The release of DOX can induce the interruption of the ETR effect and recover the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ imaging of drug release. The AIE&#8208;featured supramolecular tubisomes reported here provide an alternative approach for fabricating cylindrical polymeric nanostructures and holds great potential for imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery.

         <title>Tuning Exciton Coupling of Merocyanine Nucleoside Dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA Double Helix Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) is reported as a nucleobase surrogate that forms hydrogen&#8208;bonded base pairs, and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked dimer aggregates, with orientation&#8208; and conformation&#8208;sensitive exciton coupling strength.







Abstract
Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligonucleotides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromophore organization via electrostatic, dipolar, &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The realized supramolecular motifs include hydrogen&#8208;bonded BAM&#8211;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Unraveling the Function of Metal&#8211;Amorphous Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphization of the support for single&#8208;atoms catalysts (SACs) is another efficient but unknown strategy in improving the catalytic properties through adjusting the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). This work showcases a model ruthenium SAC and expounds on how the flexibly amorphous configuration of the support matrix functions unexpectedly in intensifying the MSI and further accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics of SACs.







Abstract
Amorphization of the support in single&#8208;atom catalysts is a less researched concept for promoting catalytic kinetics through modulating the metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). We modeled single&#8208;atom ruthenium (RuSAs) supported on amorphous cobalt/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi) to explore the favorable MSI between RuSAs and the amorphous skeleton for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Differing from the usual crystal counterpart (Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi), the electrons on RuSAs are facilitated to exchange among local configurations (Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Co/Ni) of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi since the flexibly amorphous configuration induces the possible d&#8211;d electron transfer and medium&#8208;to&#8208;long range p&#8211;&#960; orbital coupling, further intensifying the MSI. This embodies Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi with enhanced water dissociation, alleviated oxophilicity, and rapid hydrogen migration, which results in superior durability and HER activity of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi, wherein only 15&#8197;mV can deliver 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than the 58&#8197;mV required by Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi.

         <title>Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous deformation in elastomeric vitrimers is suppressed by temporarily trapping a reactive side chain in the polymer backbone. Upon heating, the network defect is recovered allowing for fast exchange. This offers a versatile strategy to simultaneously achieve fast reprocessing, while maintaining the strong dimensional stability of vitrimers.







Abstract
We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low Tg vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds via thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on the molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.

         <title>Module&#8208;Patterned Polymerization towards Crystalline 2D sp2&#8208;Carbon Covalent Organic Framework Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new topology diagram was developed for the efficient and designed synthesis of 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D sp2&#8208;carbon materials via a C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and exhibit two&#8208;photon up&#8208;conversion luminescence, create novel 2D semiconductors with low band gaps yet tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretical maxima.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress over the past decade, most polycondensation systems even upon a small structural variation of the building units eventually result in amorphous polymers other than the desired crystalline covalent organic frameworks. This synthetic dilemma is a central and challenging issue of the field. Here we report a novel approach based on module&#8208;patterned polymerization to enable efficient and designed synthesis of crystalline porous polymeric frameworks. This strategy features a wide applicability to allow the use of various knots of different structures, enables polycondensation with diverse linkers, and develops a diversity of novel crystalline 2D polymers and frameworks, as demonstrated by using the C=C bond&#8208;formation polycondensation reaction. The new sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and enable up&#8208;conversion luminescence, offer low band gap semiconductors with tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretically predicted maxima.

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Stereo&#8208; and Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers via Acid&#8208;Orthogonal Deprotection Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection reactions which proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability is reported. This chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers.







Abstract
Absolute control over polymer stereo&#8208; and sequence structure is highly challenging in polymer chemistry. Here, an acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection strategy is proposed for the iterative synthesis of a family of unimolecular polymers starting with enantiopure serines, featuring precise sequence, stereoconfiguration and side&#8208;chain functionalities that cannot be achieved using traditional polymerization techniques. Acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotections proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability. Under p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid, acidolysis of tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl can proceed exclusively, while low&#8208;dosage trifluoroacetic acid and low temperature only trigger the selective and quantitative cleavage of trityl. The pioneering use of this acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers, thus imparting their unique properties beyond natural biopolymers.

Acid-orthogonal deprotections proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid-lability. Under &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonic acid, acidolysis of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyloxycarbonyl can proceed exclusively, while low-dosage trifluoroacetic acid and low temperature only trigger the selective and quantitative cleavage of trityl. The pioneering use of this acid-orthogonal deprotection chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo- and sequence-defined polymers, thus imparting their unique properties beyond natural biopolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu0&#8211;CuI Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst was constructed for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Cu nanoparticles (NPs) derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces and CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces show a tandem effect during the CO2RR process. A high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on this tandem catalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 on a polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt;2&#8201;e&#8722;) selectivity, however, most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst for the production of C2+ products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE
) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu0&#8208;PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C2+ selectivity, whereas CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C2+ selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Conversion of Epoxides into Thiiranes: Mechanism, Stereochemical Model, and New Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations have clarified the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of the chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed thionation of epoxides with thiolactam by kinetic resolution. Bulky ortho groups are important to restrict the position of the epoxide group in the key transition states of the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, while increasing the size of the para&#8208;substituents also increases the enantioselectivity significantly.







Abstract
Computations and experiments leading to new chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) for epoxide thionations are reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of such CPA&#8208;catalyzed epoxide thionations. The calculated mechanistic information was used to design new efficient CPAs that were tested experimentally and found to be highly effective. Bulky ortho&#8208;substituents on the 3,3&#8242;&#8208;aryl groups of the CPA are important to restrict the position of the epoxide in the key transition states for the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Larger para&#8208;substituents significantly improve the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid colorimetric detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease using a zwitterionic peptide and gold colloids is reported. The sensor showed good performance in exhaled breath condensate with a limit of detection in the low nanomolar range. This technology can be integrated into regular face coverings for COVID&#8208;detection.







Abstract
The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases a positively charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t&lt;10&#8197;min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10&#8197;nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.

         <title>Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8722;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nitrogen atom transfer into aldehyde C&#8722;H bonds is reported. A palladium(II) metallonitrene species with nitrogen&#8208;centered biradical character was identified as the key intermediate and was photocrystallographically, magnetically and computationally characterized. The nucleophilic metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion step results in inverted selectivity for the net nitrene transfer catalysis.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well&#8208;established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8722;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium. Photocrystallographic, magnetic, and computational characterization support the assignment as an authentic metallonitrene (Pd&#8722;N) with a diradical nitrogen ligand that is singly bonded to PdII. Despite the subvalent nitrene character, selective C&#8722;H insertion with aldehydes follows nucleophilic selectivity. Transamidation of the benzamide product is enabled by reaction with N3SiMe3. Based on these results, a photocatalytic protocol for aldehyde C&#8722;H trimethylsilylamidation was developed that exhibits inverted, nucleophilic selectivity as compared to typical nitrene transfer catalysis. This first example of catalytic C&#8722;H nitrogen atom transfer offers facile access to primary amides after deprotection.

         <title>Back Cover: Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 9/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit displays significantly boosted electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in the presence of water as reported by Rui Cao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202114310). The crown ether unit is able to grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions. The established water network can play critical roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which mimics water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins.

         <dc:description>
The 3D&#8208;helical structure of a non&#8208;symmetric poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) with dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is reported in the Research Article by F&#233;lix Freire et&#8197;al. (e202115070). By conformational changes in the pendant group a helix inversion in the PDPA can be initiated, creating a CPL switch.

Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach with two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics, as reported by Yosi Kratish and Tobin&#8197;J. Marks in their Research Article (e202112576).

         <title>Development of Chiral Ligands for the Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Silylation and Borylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview presents an overview of the recent progress in the design of chiral ligands and substrates for the enantioselective borylation and silylation of C&#8722;H bonds, as well as the salient mechanistic features and reaction scope, thereby revealing the limitations and challenges in this area and inspiring continued development of this synthetic method.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions that install functional groups at the positions of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds can be envisioned to produce intermediates for the synthesis of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals directly from simple feedstocks. Among these C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions, those that form carbon&#8211;silicon (C&#8722;Si) and carbon&#8211;boron (C&#8722;B) bonds have been pursued because the products of these reactions can be converted to those containing a wide range of functional groups and because compounds containing silicon and boron possess unique properties that can be valuable for medicinal and materials chemistry. Although the silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds have undergone extensive development during the past two decades, enantioselective versions of these reactions were not known until a few years ago. In this Minireview, we present the rapid development of enantioselective silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds, with an emphasis on the design and development of the types of chiral ligands needed to achieve these reactions and an intention to inspire an expansion of these types of transformations.

         <title>Application of Perovskite Quantum Dots as an Absorber in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) display the quantum confinement effect yet maintain the characteristics of bulk materials. In this Review the advantages and disadvantages of perovskite QDs and significant strategies (exchange chemistry, passivation engineering, and structure engineering) for the advancement of perovskite solar cells with perovskite QDs as an absorber are discussed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) preserve the attractive properties of perovskite bulk materials and present additional advantages, owing to their quantum confinement effect, leading to their suitability as an absorber in perovskite solar cells. In this Review, the issues and advantages of perovskite QDs are analyzed in the context of purification, device fabrication with perovskite QDs, light absorption, charge transport, and stability. In addition, promising strategies to enhance perovskite QDs and QD&#8208;based solar cells are elucidated based on exchange chemistry (ion and ligand exchange), passivation engineering (ion and ligand passivation), and structure engineering (conventional/inverted, planar/mesoscopic and dimensionally graded structures). These discussions will give a clue to the further development of perovskite QDs and thus the advancement of QD&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Synthesis and Processing of Nanomaterials Mediated by Living Organisms</title>

Green living nanofactories: Nanomaterials (NMs) and nanocomposites are typically prepared by procedures that are incompatible with green chemistry and sustainability principles. But some living entities, from single cells to higher organisms, are able to synthesize and process NMs very efficiently under milder conditions. In this Minireview, the advances and prospects of this growing trend are discussed and summarized.







Abstract
Nanomaterials offer exciting properties and functionalities. However, their production and processing frequently involve complex methods, cumbersome equipment, harsh conditions, and hazardous media. The capability of organisms to accomplish this using mild conditions offers a sustainable, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly alternative. Different nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, silica nanostructures, and nanocellulose are being synthesized increasingly through living entities. In addition, the bionanofabrication potential enables also the in situ processing of nanomaterials inside biomatrices with unprecedented outcomes. In this Minireview we present a critical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vision of current nanofabrication approaches mediated by living entities (ranging from unicellular to higher organisms), in order to expand this knowledge and scrutinize future prospects. An efficient interfacial interaction at the nanoscale by green means is within reach through this approach.

         <title>Sensitive Quantification of MicroRNA in Blood through Multi&#8208;amplification Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA&#8208;Strand&#8208;Displacement Paper&#8208;Spray Mass Spectrometry (TSD&#8208;PS MS)</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;amplification paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) platform has been designed for quantifying miRNA in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction and UV light have been employed to amplify the signal and ensure the sensitivity of the detection. More importantly, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interference signals from the blood. The platform showed high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability in a prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141.







Abstract
Accurate quantification of disease&#8208;signature microRNAs (miRNAs) in biomedical samples is in high demand for clinical diagnosis but still challenging because of the low abundance of miRNAs and complicating interferences in the milieus. Here, we report a multi&#8208;amplification strategy based on paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) for the analysis of miRNAs in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA&#8208;strand&#8208;displacement reaction (TSD) is employed to amplify the signal chain and to ensure the specificity. The signal chain is then cleaved by UV light to release signal molecules for detection. Moreover, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interfering substances in the blood and further enhance the sensitivity of detection. This concept is successfully demonstrated in the prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141 in blood and serum. The proposed TSD&#8208;PS MS approach provides an efficient method for the sensitive detection of oligonucleotides at low concentration in complicated milieus.

         <title>Triplet Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Guest Molecules through Induced Fit in a Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of dynamic nuclear polarization of guest molecules in a porous host material at around room temperature is reported. The induced fit of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) for guest molecules suppresses the nuclear spin relaxation and allows the polarization transfer to target guest molecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization utilizing photoexcited triplet electrons (triplet&#8208;DNP) has great potential for room&#8208;temperature hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. However, the polarization transfer to molecules of interest remains a challenge due to the fast spin relaxation and weak interaction with target molecules at room temperature in conventional host materials. Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts, 1H spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5&#8208;fluorouracil as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host&#8211;guest interactions. Combined with triplet&#8208;DNP and cross&#8208;polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced 19F&#8197;NMR signal of guest target molecules.

         <title>Sn7Br10S2: The First Ternary Halogen&#8208;Rich Chalcohalide Exhibiting a Chiral Structure and Pronounced Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary halogen&#8208;rich nonlinear optical chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2 exhibits a strong phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.5 &#215; AGS@2.1&#8197;&#956;m) and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (6.3 &#215; AGS). This work provides a competitive candidate with good performance, facile synthesis and simple chemical composition for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) applications, and also introduces a facile strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance NLO materials via a symmetry break.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are significant in laser technology for civil and military uses. Here, we report the synthesis, structural chemistry and NLO properties of a halogen&#8208;rich chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2. Its noncentrosymmetric (NCS, P63) structure can be considered as partially aliovalent anion substitution of SnBr2 (P63/m) induced centrosymmetric (CS) to NCS structural transformation. The 3D &#8734;[Sn(1)6Sn(2)6Br6X6]6&#8722; (X=Br/S) channel framework consists of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 trigonal pyramids. It exhibits excellent NLO performance, including a strong phase&#8208;matchable NLO response of 1.5 &#215; AgGaS2and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 6.3 &#215; AgGaS2.Investigation of the structure&#8211;NLO performance relationship confirms that the effective arrangement of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 units predominantly contributes to the large SHG response. These results indicate Sn7Br10S2 is a potential IR NLO candidate and provides a new feasible system for promising NLO materials.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Additions of Enol Silanes to In Situ Generated Cyclic, Aliphatic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated nitrogen heterocycles are essential pharmacophores in drugs and natural products, and general methods for their enantioselective synthesis are still highly sought after. A new direct approach utilizing hemiaminal methyl ethers as N&#8208;acyliminium precursors for the enantioselective preparation of cyclic, aliphatic and 2&#8208;subsituted pyrrolidines, piperidines and azepanes has been achieved.







Abstract
Strong and confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalysts enable highly enantioselective substitutions of cyclic, aliphatic hemiaminal ethers with enol silanes. 2&#8208;Substituted pyrrolidines, piperidines, and azepanes are obtained with high enantioselectivities, and the method displays a broad tolerance of various enol silane nucleophiles. Several natural products can be accessed using this methodology. Mechanistic studies support the intermediacy of non&#8208;stabilized, cyclic N&#8208;(exo&#8208;acyl)iminium ions, paired with the confined chiral counteranion. Computational studies suggest transition states that explain the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Porous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Networks with Hydrogel&#8208;Like Actuation and Reconfigurable Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network can swell in water for actuation through both water absorption and order&#8211;disorder phase transition, and be loaded with functional fillers to display reconfigurable functions.







Abstract
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network (LCN), prepared by using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100&#8201;% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures a thermally induced shape change associated with a LC&#8208;isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8211;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCNs can be explored for versatile stimuli&#8208;triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquids, photothermal dyes and fluorophores, which imparts the porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light&#8208;driven locomotion, and emissive color.

         <title>Transforming Rhodamine Dyes for (d)STORM Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy via 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Imidazolium Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium markedly improves the photoswitching behavior and overall performance of (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ((d)STORM). Excellent super&#8208;resolution microscopy images are thus obtained under green excitation.







Abstract
We introduce a strategy to optimize the photoswitching behavior of rhodamines for (d)STORM super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium, the resultant dyes are markedly sensitized toward photoswitching, and exhibit outstanding (d)STORM performance with fast on&#8208;off switching, long&#8208;lasting blinking, and bright single&#8208;molecule emission. We thus attain excellent (d)STORM images under green excitation that are on par with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; red&#8208;excited dyes, including for difficult structures such as the mammalian actin cytoskeleton, and demonstrate high&#8208;quality two&#8208;color three&#8208;dimensional (d)STORM.

&#8220;Dynamic&#8221; helical metal&#8208;based polymers can offer adaptability and functionality, but such systems remain unexplored. The titled polymers display mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for &#946;&#8208;(L and D)&#8208;arabinopyranosyl sidechains (signifying helical coiling with preferred, opposite screw sense); the responsiveness and dynamic nature of the folded conformations are evident, and developments toward helicity&#8208;governed activity are described.







Abstract
The study of metallopolymers with controllable helical sense remains in its infancy. We report arabinose&#8208;functionalized (Zn&#8208;salphen)&#8208;based conjugated polymers that display mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra for L&#8208; and D&#8208;sugar sidechains respectively, signifying ordered (helical) coiling of the polymer backbone with opposite screw&#8208;sense preferences. The observation of different spectroscopic behavior and Cotton effects for a variety of solvents (in a reversible manner) and temperatures, ascribed to changes in the extent of intrachain (Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(salphen) and &#960;&#8208;stacking) interactions between Zn&#8208;salphen moieties, thus indicate the flexible, responsive and dynamic nature of the folded helical conformation in these systems. An application study signifying that activity can be governed by the structure and helical sense of the polymer is described.

&lt;p&gt;The study of metallopolymers with controllable helical sense remains in its infancy. We report arabinose-functionalized (Zn-salphen)-based conjugated polymers that display mirror-image circular dichroism spectra for L- and D-sugar sidechains respectively, signifying ordered (helical) coiling of the polymer backbone with opposite screw-sense preferences. The observation of different spectroscopic behavior and Cotton effects for a variety of solvents (in a reversible manner) and temperatures, ascribed to changes in the extent of intrachain (Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(salphen) and &#960;-stacking) interactions between Zn-salphen moieties, thus indicate the flexible, responsive and dynamic nature of the folded helical conformation in these systems. An application study signifying that activity can be governed by the structure and helical sense of the polymer is described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit was designed and synthesized to model water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the crown ether unit of this cobalt corrole can grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions and the established water network plays vital roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to significantly boosted electrocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water&#8208;containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and 1H&#8197;NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown&#8208;ether&#8208;free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1)&#8197;external 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether to extract water molecules and 2)&#8197;potassium ion or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;n&#8208;butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water&#8208;containing networks.

         <title>A Persistent Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Thioketyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable thioketyl radical anion formed by reduction of a phosphanylthioketone with alkali metals is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the products were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radicals is mainly localized at the thiocarbonyl C&#8722;S unit.







Abstract
Alkali metal salts, M+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S].&#8722; (M=Na, K; 2_M; Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phenyl) containing a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S (1), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within 2_M is mainly located at the sulfur (49&#8201;%) and the carbonyl carbon (33&#8201;%) atoms. Upon adding [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand to the radical species 2_K to minimize the interionic interaction, an activation reaction was observed, yielding a potassium salt with a phosphanyl thioether based anion, [K(crypt)]+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(&#8722;S&#8208;iPr)&#8722;P(iPr)2S]&#8722; (3) as the product of an intermolecular shift of an iPr group from a second anion. The products were fully characterized and application of the radical anion as a reducing agent was demonstrated.

         <title>Optical Control of Mitosis with a Photoswitchable Eg5 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical control of a mitotic kinesin, Eg5, was achieved through an azobenzene analog of EMD&#8208;534085. Under UV light conditions, HeLa cells undergo mitotic arrest, as evidenced by the formation of a monopolar spindle.







Abstract
Eg5 is a kinesin motor protein that is responsible for bipolar spindle formation and plays a crucial role during mitosis. Loss of Eg5 function leads to the formation of monopolar spindles, followed by mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death. Several cell&#8208;permeable small molecules have been reported to inhibit Eg5 and some have been evaluated as anticancer agents. We now describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of photoswitchable variants with five different pharmacophores. Our lead compound Azo&#8208;EMD is a cell permeable azobenzene that inhibits Eg5 more potently in its light&#8208;induced cis form. This activity decreased the velocity of Eg5 in single&#8208;molecule assays, promoted formation of monopolar spindles, and led to mitotic arrest in a light dependent way.

         <title>H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;Type Global Aromaticity in a 3D Fully Conjugated Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;type global aromaticity was observed in a 3D fully conjugated molecular cage at different oxidation states. The dication 12+ has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; the tetracation 14+ has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic.







Abstract
Global aromaticity in 3D &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular cages remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a fully conjugated molecular cage (1) containing two bridged triphenylamine units and three quinoidal bithiophene arms. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR/ESR measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: 1) its dication (12+) has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; 2) its tetracation (14+) has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic; and 3) its hexacation (16+) has a closed&#8208;shell nature and shows local aromaticity. The study demonstrated a close relationship between 2D H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity and 3D global &#960;&#8208;aromaticity.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Functionalizations of Polyfluorinated Aliphatic Amides and Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic approach to selective functionalization of the strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides is reported, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs through hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of perfluoalkyl units has huge potential towards accessing functionalized organofluorinated compounds, but remains challenging due to the high C&#8722;F bond strength and inherent selectivity challenges. We report a new catalytic approach to the selective functionalization of strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides. This simple reaction proceeds in mild and operational fashion with divergent conversions, including hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.

Chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium salts were used as new phase&#8208;transfer organocatalysts for asymmetric alkylation to construct 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine motifs containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon centers in high yields with excellent cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the possible reaction mechanism and the origins of the exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Novel asymmetric mono&#8208; and dialkylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;substituted 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines catalyzed by new chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium organocatalysts have been developed, resulting in a range of enantioenriched 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine derivatives containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters. The reactions feature high yields (up to 98%), and excellent cis&#8208;diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and they provide a new asymmetric synthetic approach to important functionalized 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine skeletons. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on both control experiments and extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Chirality Drives Separation by Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of N&#8208;protonated Verapamil by electrospray ionization (ESI) yields two peaks when measured by differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). This strange behaviour is caused by protonation&#8208;induced chirality, whereby protonation of Verapamil's tertiary amino moiety during ESI generates diastereomers that can be resolved in the gas phase.







Abstract
Upon development of a workflow to analyze (&#177;)&#8208;Verapamil and its metabolites using differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), we noticed that the ionogram of protonated Verapamil consisted of two peaks. This was inconsistent with its metabolites, as each exhibited only a single peak in the respective ionograms. The unique behaviour of Verapamil was attributed to protonation at its tertiary amino moiety, which generated a stereogenic quaternary amine. The introduction of additional chirality upon N&#8208;protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (R,R), (S,S), (R,S), or (S,R). The (R,R)/(S,S) and (R,S)/(S,R) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques. Protonation&#8208;induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as N&#8208;protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages bearing shape&#8208;shifting bullvalene ligands are prepared. The enormous potential complexity is limited by geometric constraints in solution, which converge to a single isomer in the solid state. Through detailed experimental and computational analysis, we map the fluxional nature of these systems.







Abstract
A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M=Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Prediction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Guest Accessibility from Linker and Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a machine&#8208;learning tool that predicts the porosity of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials based solely on chemical properties of their constituents: the metal and the inorganic linker. Our method leverages data available for thousands of synthesised MOF in prediction of properties of interest in potential synthetic targets without requiring knowledge of their structure but only requiring the knowledge of their constituents.







Abstract
The choice of metal and linker together define the structure and therefore the guest accessibility of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), but the large number of possible metal&#8208;linker combinations makes the selection of components for synthesis challenging. We predict the guest accessibility of a MOF with 80.5&#8201;% certainty based solely on the identity of these two components as chosen by the experimentalist, by decomposing reported experimental three&#8208;dimensional MOF structures in the Cambridge Structural Database into metal and linker and then learning the connection between the components&#8217; chemistry and the MOF porosity. Pore dimensions of the guest&#8208;accessible space are classified into four ranges with three sequential models. Both the dataset and the predictive models are available to download and offer simple guidance in prioritization of the choice of the components for exploratory MOF synthesis for separation and catalysis based on guest accessibility considerations.

         <title>Fluorinated Sulfinates as Source of Alkyl Radicals in the Photo&#8208;Enantiocontrolled &#946;&#8208;Functionalization of Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of gem&#8208;difluoro sulfinates in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds in a chiral fashion is presented. This was tackled by rerouting the chemical pathway of alkyl sulfonyl radicals from traditional sulfonylation to alkylation performance. The efficacy of these sulfinates for assisting SO2 extrusion is shown by allowing the installation of CF2&#8208;bearing scaffolds, a modern task in the pharmaceutical arena.







Abstract
The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a wide range of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less&#8208;stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading&#8208;mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8211;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light&#8208;driven insertion of gem&#8208;difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Mechanochemical Grignard Reactions with Gaseous CO2 and Sodium Methyl Carbonate**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard&#8208;type reactions have been performed in ball mills providing carboxylic acids from organobromides with gaseous CO2 or sodium methyl carbonate (SMC) as C1&#8208;synthon. The transformations are solvent&#8208;free and occur in the presence of LiOH under liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) conditions with 2&#8197;equivalents of 2&#8208;MeTHF as ethereal additive.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step protocol for the preparation of Grignard reagents from organobromides in a ball mill and their subsequent reactions with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) or sodium methyl carbonate providing aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids in up to 82&#8201;% yield is reported. Noteworthy are the short reaction times and the significantly reduced solvent amounts [2.0&#8197;equiv. for liquid assisted grinding (LAG) conditions]. Unexpectedly, aryl bromides with methoxy substituents lead to symmetric ketones as major products.

         <title>A Moisture&#8208;assisted Rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies are required to address the energy crisis and CO  2  emission. Among various metal&#8208;CO  2  batteries that utilize CO  2  and offer high energy density, rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO  2  batteries based on earth&#8208;abundant and safe magnesium (Mg) metal have been limited due to the lack of compatible electrolyte, operation atmosphere, and ambiguous reaction mechanism. Herein, the first rechargeable nonaqueous Mg&#8208;CO  2  battery is proposed, which can cycle for more than 250 h under the humid environment and maintain the discharge voltage over 1 V at 200 mA g  &#8208;1  . Combining with the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the electrochemical reaction mechanism is revealed to be 2Mg + 3CO  2  + 6H  2  O &#8596; 2MgCO  3  &#183;3H  2  O + C. It is anticipated that the feasibility of rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO  2  batteries would stimulate the development of other multivalent metal&#8208;CO  2  batteries and extend CO  2  fixation and utilization for carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

Our DFT calculations via distortion/interaction analysis revealed that both stannum and hydrogen ene reactions with cyclohexyne have later transition states due to their higher distortion energies in transition states than those in benzyne reactions, which lead to enhanced Pauli repulsion as the decisive factor in interaction energy accompanied with enlarged energy gap between two types of ene reactions. Therefore, excellent chemoselectivity was disclosed in the cyclohexyne ene rea ction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>NMR/MRI are critical tools for studying molecular structure and interactions but suffer from relatively low sensitivity and spectral overlap. Here, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approach, termed DREAMTIME, is introduced that provides &#8220;a molecular window&#8221; inside complex systems, capable of showing only what the user desires, with complete molecular specificity. The user chooses a list of molecules of interest, and the approach detects only those targets while all other molecules are invisible. The approach is demonstrated in whole human blood/urine, small living aquatic organisms in 1D/2D NMR and MRI. Finally, as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, once overlap is removed via DREAMTIME, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;focusing&#8221; approach can be used to increase sensitivity. In human blood and urine, sensitivity increases of 7&#8208;12 fold over standard  1  H NMR are observed. Applicable even to unknowns, DREAMTIME has widespread application, from monitoring product formation in organic chemistry to monitoring/identifying suites of molecular targets in complex media or in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Short Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Actinobolin: Simple Entry to Complex Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a concise synthesis of the naturally occurring protein synthesis inhibitor (+)&#8208;actinobolin (  1  ). The densely functionalized and stereochemically complex molecular structure of  1  was assembled from (&#8208;)&#8208;quinic acid, L&#8208;threonine, and L&#8208;alanine as the principal components. Our route is based around a convergent strategy that features conjugate addition of an &#945;&#8208;amino radical in the key fragment&#8208;coupling step. The dramatically simplified synthesis of (+)&#8208;actinobolin proceeding in 9 steps with 18% overall yield has practical implications for analog preparation, as demonstrated herein.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stereochemical Confirmation, and Derivatization of a Clerodane Diterpene That Sensitizes Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, antibiotic resistance has grown to a point where orthogonal approaches to combating infections caused by resistant bacteria are needed. One such approach is the development of non&#8208;microbicidal small molecules that potentiate the activity of conventional antibiotics, termed adjuvants. We previously established that the diterpene natural product 12(S),16&#949;&#8208;Dihydroxycleroda&#8208;3,13&#8208;dien&#8208;15,16&#8208;olide, which we refer to as (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112 for short, synergizes with oxacillin against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To further explore this activity, (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112 was synthesized and the structure confirmed through X&#8208;ray analysis. Preliminary structure&#8208;activity relationship studies following the synthesis of several analogues identified key structural elements responsible for activity and indicate that scaffold simplification is possible. A preliminary mode of action study suggests mecA plays a role in the adjuvant activity of (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112.</dc:description>

         <title>The Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Generated Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the chemical synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers, we demonstrated for the first time, the protein&#8208;target mediated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs). We prepared pre&#8208;polymerisation mixtures containing different ratios of nucleotides, an initiator sequence and protein template and incubated each mixture with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Upon purification and rebinding of the EGAs against the target, we observed an enhancement in binding of templated&#8208;EGAs against the target compared to a non&#8208;templated control. These results demonstrate the presence of two primary mechanisms for the formation of EGAs, namely, the binding of random sequences to the target as observed in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and the dynamic competition between TdT enzyme and the target protein for binding of EGAs during synthesis. The latter mechanism serves to increase the stringency of EGA&#8208;based screening and represents a new way to develop aptamers that relies on rational design.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we reported a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct far&#8208;red and NIR fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the  meso  &#8208;positions of various fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (10  2  &#8211;10  3  &#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806 nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Triphase Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Silver&#8208;Decorated Titanium Oxide at a Gas&#8208;Water Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive process to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals. But this reaction is often restricted by the poor mass transfer of CO2 in the liquid phase. Here, we developed a triphase photocatalytic CO2RR system by supporting Ag&#8208;decorated TiO2 nanoparticles at a gas&#8208;water boundary with hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic abrupt interfacial wettability. Such a triphase system allows the rapid delivery of gas&#8208;phase CO2 to the surface of photocatalysts while maintaining an efficient water supply and uncovered active sites. Ag&#8208;TiO2 supported at the gas&#8208;water boundary showed a CO2 reduction rate of 305.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, without hole scavengers, approximately 8 times higher than the nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid phase. Even using diluted CO2 (10%) as the reactant, the CO2RR activity was superior to most reported Ag&#8208;TiO2 based photocatalysts using pure CO2. The findings provide a general strategy to promote the interfacial CO2 mass transfer to improve photoactivity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;phase Approach to Fusicoccane Synthesis To Uncover a Compound That Reduces Tumourigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alterbrassicicene D (  1  ) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (  2  ) were synthesised  via  a two&#8208;phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5&#8208;8&#8208;5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base&#8208;mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of  2  . The route is scalable and we generated 15 g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (  R  )&#8208;limonene and 720 mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of  2  and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC&#8208;1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour&#8208;initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.</dc:description>
