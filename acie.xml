         <title>Tailoring the Microporosity of Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity for Advanced Gas Separation by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the microporosity of intrinsically microporous polymers at the atomic level is one of the biggest challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes. In this study  , for the first time, the Al  2  O  3  atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used to modify the microporosity of a typical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1) at the atomic level.  PIM&#8208;1 with six ALD cycles (PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure&#8208; and mixed&#8208;gas separation, and anti&#8208;aging properties. The O  2  /N  2  , H  2  /N  2  , and H  2  /CH  4  separation performances were adequate above the latest trade&#8208;off lines. PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;6 showed CO  2  and O  2  permeabilities of 624 and 188 Barrer, combined with CO  2  /CH  4  and O  2  /N  2  selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively. This significantly enhanced performance was attributed to the strong size sieving effect induced by the Al  2  O  3  deposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective and Stereodivergent Synthesis of 2&#8208;Cinnamylpyrrolines Enabled by Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Iminoalkenylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed iminoalkenylation of &#947;&#8208;alkenyl O&#8208;acyl oximes has been developed. Readily available alkenylboronic acids serve as alkenylation reagents, leading to densely functionalized pyrrolines. Both (  E  )&#8208; and (  Z  )&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are accessible depending on the reaction solvent. In dichloromethane, (  E  )&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are produced through photoredox&#8208;mediated a single&#8208;electron transfer process. In tetrahydrofuran, (Z)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are generated by photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic  E  to  Z  isomerization of (  E  )&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines though an energy transfer pathway. Two stereocenters are established with complete diastereoselectivity and only one diastereomer is isolated.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Molecular Nanocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular nanocarbons containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behavior, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing. Heptagon incorporation can not only induce negative curvature within nanocarbon scaffolds, but also confer significantly altered properties through interaction with adjacent non&#8208;hexagonal rings. Despite the disclosure of several beautiful examples in recent years, synthetic strategies toward heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons remain relatively limited due to the intrinsic challenges of heptagon formation and incorporation into polyarene frameworks. In this minireview, recent advances in solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons, as well as the intriguing properties of these frameworks, will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence&#8208;Spin Label Probe for Visualization and Quantification of Target Molecules in Tissue by Multiplexed FLIM &#8211; EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous visualization and concentration quantification of molecules in biological tissue is an important though challenging goal. The advantages of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for visualization, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for quantification are complementary. Their combination in a multiplexed approach promises a successful but ambitious strategy because of spin label&#8208;mediated fluorescence quenching. Here, we solved this problem and present the molecular design of a dual label (DL) compound comprising a highly fluorescent dye together with an EPR spin probe, which also renders the fluorescence lifetime to be concentration sensitive. The DL can easily be coupled to the biomolecule of choice, enabling  in vivo  and  in vitro  applications. This novel approach paves the way for elegant studies ranging from fundamental biological investigations to&#160;preclinical drug research, as shown in proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle penetration experiments in human skin  ex vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>&lt;p class="Title1"&gt;&lt;span lang="DE"&gt;Metal Coordinated Supramolecular Polymers from the Minimalistic Hybrid Peptide Foldamers&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</title>

         <dc:description>Availing the peptide folded architectures to design metal coordinated frameworks and cages is restricted due to the scarcity of readily accessible short and stable secondary structures. The secondary structures, &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheets, play significant roles in stabilizing tertiary folds of proteins. Designing such helical structures from the short sequences of peptides without having any steric restrictions is exceptionally challenging. Here we reveal the short &#945;,&#947;&#8208;hybrid tripeptide sequences that manifest stable helical structures without having any sterically constrained amino acids. These short hybrid tripeptides fold into helices even in the presence of two typically &#946;&#8208;sheet favouring &#945;&#8208;Val residues. The hybrid helix consisting of terminal pyridine units coordinates with the metal ions and drives the helical polymerization. Depending on the sequence and the position of N in pyridine moieties, these peptides form selective metallogels with Ag+ and Cu2+ ions. The X&#8208;ray analysis of the peptide single crystals obtained from the gel matrix reveals that the helical structure is maintained during the self&#8208;assembly process. Further, by varying the counter anion a 3D helical crystalline coordination polymer with permanent porosity is generated. The findings reported here can be used to design new functional metal&#8208;foldamer coordinated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Locked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers Showing Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, small molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been widely applied in cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As an analogue, however, D&#8208;A conjugated polymers often possess a significant frontier molecular orbital overlap because of the conjugation elongation to some degree, leading to no TADF caused by a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#8710; E  ST  ). To solve this problem, herein a novel steric locking strategy is proposed by incorporating methyl groups into D&#8208;A conjugated polymers. Benefitting from the methyl hindrance, the torsion between the donor and acceptor can be well tuned to form a sterically&#8208;locked conformation, so that the unwanted relaxation toward planarity and thus conjugation elongation is prevented to boost hole&#8208;electron separation. Consequently, the resultant sterically&#8208;locked D&#8208;A conjugated polymer achieves an extremely low &#8710; E  ST  of 0.09 eV to enable efficient TADF. The corresponding doped and non&#8208;doped devices are fabricated via a solution process, revealing a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.0% (79.4 cd/A, 75.0 lm/W) and 15.3% (50.9 cd/A, 47.3 lm/W), respectively, together with a gentle efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Arylation of Enantiotopic Secondary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral IBiox ligands show an exceptional reactivity and a high enantioselectivity in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylation of enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds. This reaction leads to a variety of scalemic indane products, containing a tertiary stereocenter, from easily accessible precursors.







Abstract
The enantioselective functionalization of nonactivated enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds is one of the greatest challenges in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation proceeding by an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism. Such reactions have remained elusive within the realm of Pd0 catalysis. Reported here is the unique reactivity profile of the IBiox ligand family in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular arylation of such nonactivated secondary C&#8722;H bonds. Chiral C2&#8208;symmetric IBiox ligands led to high enantioselectivities for a broad range of valuable indane products containing a tertiary stereocenter, as well as the arylation of secondary C&#8722;H bonds adjacent to amides. Depending on the amide substituents and upon control of reaction time, indanes containing labile tertiary stereocenters were also obtained with high enantioselectivities. Analysis of the steric maps of the IBiox ligands indicated that the level of enantioselectivity correlates with the difference between the two most occupied and the two less occupied space quadrants, and provided a blueprint for the design of even more efficient ligands.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Singlet SnI&#8197;Diradical and H2&#8197;Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative 4 with two&#8208;coordinated SnI atoms has been isolated as a green crystalline solid. The ground state of 4 is an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) with the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T) of 4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (according to CASSCF, &#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Consequently, 4 exhibits a half&#8208;field EPR signal at 100&#8197;K and undergoes H2 splitting at room temperature to quantitatively yield the SnII hydride 5 as an orange solid.







Abstract
The first SnI diradical [(ADCPh)Sn]2 (4) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADCPh={CN(Dipp)}2CPh; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) scaffold has been isolated as a green crystalline solid by KC8 reduction of the corresponding bis&#8208;chlorostannylene [(ADCPh)SnCl]2 (3). The six&#8208;membered C4Sn2&#8208;ring of 4 containing six &#960;&#8208;electrons shows a diatropic ring current, thus 4 may also be regarded as the first 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative. DFT calculations suggest an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) ground state of 4 with a remarkably small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which is consistent with CASSCF (&#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and diradical character y=37&#8201;%) calculations. The diradical 4 splits H2 at room temperature to yield the bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADCPh)SnH]2 (5). Further reactivity of 4 has been studied with PhSeSePh and MeOTf.

         <title>Growth of Colloidal Nanocrystals by Liquid&#8208;Like Coalescence**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles grow by liquid&#8208;like coalescence rather than Ostwald ripening in the absence of supersaturation. The effective activation energy of the coalescence process is associated with two factors: one is proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles and the other is related to the reconstruction. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles.







Abstract
We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Tumor Therapy via Integrated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom enzyme (SAE) is a novel type of nanozyme that exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity. SAE has recently been demonstrated high potential in tumor therapy by altering cellular redox balance. Here, we constructed a PEGylated manganese&#8208;based SAE (Mn/PSAE) by coordination of single&#8208;atom manganese to nitrogen atoms in hollow zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Mn/PSAE catalyzes the conversion of cellular H  2  O  2  to &#8211;OH through a Fenton&#8208;like reaction; it also promotes the decomposition of H  2  O  2  to O  2  and continuously catalyzes the conversion of O  2  to cytotoxic &#8211;O  2  &#8208;  via  oxidase&#8208;like activity. The catalytic activity of Mn/PSAE is more pronounced in the weak acidic tumor environment; therefore, these cascade reactions enable the sufficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effectively kill tumor cells. In addition, the prominent photo&#8208;thermal conversion property of the amorphous carbon can be utilized for photothermal therapy. Hence, Mn/PSAE exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy through tumor microenvironment stimulated generation of multiple ROS and photothermal activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Couplings of Aryl Diazonium Salts in Methanol: Pd(II)&#8208;Alkoxy as Reactivity&#8208;Controlling Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions of aryl diazonium salts are generally assumed to proceed via cationic Pd(II)&#160;intermediates which in turn would be highly reactive in the subsequent transmetalation step. Contrary to this belief, we herein report our observation and rationalization of opposing reactivities of ArN2+&#160;in Suzuki (= effective) and Stille (= ineffective) cross&#8208;couplings in MeOH. Our systematic experimental and computational studies on the roles of transmetalating agent, solvent, base and the likely involvement of in&#8208;situ formed diazoether derivatives challenge the currently accepted mechanism. Our data suggest that the observed solvent dichotomy is primarily due to Pd(II)&#8208; methoxy intermediates being formed, which are unreactive with arylstannanes, but highly reactive with arylboronic acids, complementing the Suzuki "Pd&#8208;oxy"&#160;mechanism with the direct demonstration of transmetalation of a Pd(II)&#8208;alkoxy complex. Lewis acids were found to circumvent this reactivity divergence, promoting efficient couplings regardless of the employed conditions or coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Bandgap and Surface Structure of CsPbCl3 Nanocrystals to Achieve Efficient Ultraviolet Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have attracted wide attention due to their intriguing luminescent properties including efficient light conversion, narrow emission bandwidth and&#160;composition&#8208;dependent emissions. However, their emissions mainly locate in the visible region and they often suffer from low luminescent efficiency in the blue and violet region. Herein, we report the design of novel ultraviolet luminescent CsPbCl  3&#160;  nanocrystals (NCs) with the emission peak at 381 nm through doping of cadmium ions. Subsequently, a surface passivation strategy with CdCl  2  is adopted to improve their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY)&#160;with the maximum value of 60.5%, which is 67 times higher than that of the pristine counterparts. The PLQY of the surface passivated NCs remains over 50% after one week while the pristine NCs show negligible emission.&#160;By virtue of density functional theory&#160;calculations, we reveal that the higher PLQY and better stability after surface passivation may result from the significant elimination of surface chloride vacancy (V  Cl  ) defects. These findings provide fundamental insights into the optical manipulation of metal ions&#8208;doped CsPbCl  3  NCs, thus laying a foundation for the future design of efficient UV&#8208;emitting halide perovskites through bandgap and surface structure engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe/Fe3C boost H2O2 utilization for methane conversion overwhelming O2 generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H  2  O  2  as a well&#8208;known efficient oxidant is widely involved in chemical industry mainly because of its homolytic cleavage into &#8226;OH (stronger oxidant), but it always competes with O  2  generation resulting in H  2  O  2  waste. Here, we fabricate heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type Fe&#8208;based catalysts containing Fe&#8208;N  x  sites and Fe/Fe  3  C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;N  x  at the low spin state is the active site for &#8226;OH generation. Fe/Fe  3  C, especially for Fe  3  C, promotes Fe&#8208;N  x  sites for the homolytic cleavages of H  2  O  2  into &#8226;OH, but the Fe/Fe  3  C nanoparticle (Fe(0) as the main component) with more electrons is prone to the undesired O  2  generation. Benefiting from finely tuning active sites, 18% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with a liquid oxygenates selectivity of about&#160;96% (formic acid selectivity over 90%). Importantly, the O  2  generation was suppressed 68%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H  2  O  2  in chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Pyroptosis by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring AIE Photosensitizer Design: New Prospect for Photodynamic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroptosis as a lytic and inflammatory form of cell death is a powerful tool to fight against cancer. However, pyroptosis is usually activated by chemotherapeutic drugs, which limits its anti&#8208;tumor applications due to drug resistance and severe side effects.&#160;Herein, we demonstrate that membrane targeting photosensitizers can induce pyroptosis for cancer cell ablation with noninvasiveness and low side effects. A series of membrane anchoring photosensitizers (TBD&#8208;R PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were prepared through conjugation of TBD and phenyl ring with cationic chains. Upon light irradiation, cytotoxic ROS were produced in situ, resulting in direct membrane damage and superior cancer cell ablation. Detailed study revealed that pyroptosis gradually became the dominant cell death pathway along with the increase of TBD&#8208;R PSs membrane anchoring capability. This study offers a photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis&#8208;based intervention strategy for cancer cell ablation.</dc:description>

         <title>The protein corona leads to deformation of spherical micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of a non&#8208;specific protein corona around nanoparticle has been identified as one of the culprits for failed nanomedicine. It is now well&#8208;known that the amount and type of adsorbed protein from the blood plasma will determine the fate of nanoparticles as well as the accessibility of targeting ligands. In this work, we show that the adsorbed protein will not only potentially enlarge the size of nanoparticles and change their surface properties, but in the case of soft nanoparticles such as polymer micelles it can also lead to deformation. Poly(1&#8208;  O  &#8208;methacryloyl &#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;D&#8208;fructopyranose)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(methylmethacrylate) (P(1&#8208;  O  &#8208;MAFru)&#8208;  b  &#8208;PMMA) block co&#8208;polymers were self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles. The structure of the nanoparticles was analyzed by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and found to have a spherical core&#8208;shell morphology. Upon incubation with albumin, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and further SANS and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) revealed the adsorption of albumin and deformation of the nanoparticles with a spheroid geometry. Removal of the protein led to the reversal of the morphology back to the spherical core&#8208;shell structure. Structural studies were paralleled with cell studies of uptake of the nanoparticles. These findings imply that proteins will not only form a cover over the nanoparticle, but the observed deformation may influence blood circulation time and cell uptake as non&#8208;spherical nanoparticles were observed to display biological behaviours different to their spherical counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Remote Activation of Ferroptosis in Target Tumor Cells through a Photothermally Responsive Iron&#8208;Chelated Biopolymer Nanoplatform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death that shows promise for tumor treatment. Nevertheless, most of the current ferroptosis tumor therapies are based on the intrinsic pathological features of the malignancies, and it would be of substantial clinical significance to develop new ferroptosis&#8208;inducing strategies that have improved tumor specificity and modulability. In this study, we have constructed a polydopamine&#8208;based nanoplatform (Fe(II)PDA@LAP&#8208;PEG&#8208;cRGD) for the efficient loading of Fe  2+  ions and &#946;&#8208;lapachone (LAP), which could readily initiate ferroptosis in tumor cells upon treatment with near&#8208;infrared light. Specifically, the PDA nanostructures could generate mild hyperthermia under NIR irritation and trigger the release of the ferroptosis&#8208;inducing Fe  2+  ions. Meanwhile, the NIR&#8208;actuated photothermal effect would also activate cellular heat shock response and upregulate the downstream NQO1 via HSP70/NQO1 axis, which could facilitate the bioreduction of the concurrently released &#946;&#8208;lapachone and enhance intracellular H  2  O  2  formation to promote the Fe  2+  &#8208;mediated lipid peroxidation. This robust strategy for the remote activation and enhancement of ferroptosis in vivo holds promise for the management of a wide variety of tumor indications in a clinical context.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Dataset Reveals Environment Effects within a Fluorescent Protein Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropic environments can drastically alter the spectroscopy and photochemistry of molecules, leading to complex structure&#8208;function relationships. We examined this using fluorescent proteins as easy&#8208;to&#8208;modify model systems. Starting from a single scaffold, we have developed a range of 27 photochromic fluorescent proteins that cover a broad range of spectroscopic properties, including the determination of 43 crystal structures. Correlation and principal component analysis confirmed the complex relationship between structure and spectroscopy, but also allowed us to identify consistent trends and to relate these to the spatial organization. We find that changes in spectroscopic properties can come about through multiple underlying mechanisms, of which polarity, hydrogen bonding and presence of water molecules are key modulators. We anticipate that our findings and rich structure/spectroscopy dataset can open opportunities for the development and evaluation of new and existing protein engineering methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate 1,6&#8208;, 1,8&#8208;, and 1,10&#8208;Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric remote conjugate borylation is challenging as the control of regioselectivity is not trivial, the electrophilicity of remote sites is extenuated, and the remote asymmetric induction away from the carbonyl group is difficult. Herein, catalytic asymmetric conjugate 1,6&#8208;, 1,8&#8208; and 1,10&#8208;borylation was developed with excellent regioselectivity, which delivered &#945;&#8208;chiral boronates in moderate to high yields with high enantioselectivity. The produced chiral boronate smoothly underwent oxidation, cross&#8208;coupling, and one&#8208;carbon homologation to give synthetically versatile chiral compounds in moderate yields with excellent stereoretention. Furthermore, a stereomechanistic analysis was conducted using DFT calculations, which provides insights into the origins of the regioselectivity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catalytic asymmetric remote conjugate borylation is challenging as the control of regioselectivity is not trivial, the electrophilicity of remote sites is extenuated, and the remote asymmetric induction away from the carbonyl group is difficult.

         <title>Tautomeric Molecule Assisted Sunscreen Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UV light always does great harm to the perovskite solar cells which relentlessly degrades perovskite and impairs perovskite device lifetime. Meanwhile, surface defects in perovskite film further accelerate the degradation process and serve as the nonradiative charge recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule, 2&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone, can not only protect the perovskite solar cell from the UV&#8208;degradation but also enables molecular defect passivation through interaction between functional groups and defects by molecular tautomerism under UV light illumination. Therefore, the sunscreen strategy efficiently enhances the UV endurance of PSC with sunscreen molecule and improves defect formation energy to &#8208;1.35 eV. The perovskite solar cell with sunscreen (sunscreen PSC) exhibits the champion efficiencies up to 23.09% (0.04 cm 2  ) and 19.73% (1.00 cm 2  ) as well as the long&#8208;term UV (UVa: 365 nm and UVb: 285 nm) stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions With Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piptides, a new form of chemotype, are accessible from natural amino acids in either configuration, hence can conveniently display all the side chain pharmacophores found in peptides and proteins. They can be made in solution or on supports and are proteolytically&#8208;/pH&#8208;robust. Piptide&#8208;based disruption of EGF&#8901;EGFR was chosen as an initial challenge and Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) was used to evaluate candidates.







Abstract
Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.

         <title>Probing Membrane Protein Association Using Concentration&#8208;Dependent Number and Brightness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. cdN&amp;B uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant.







Abstract
We introduce concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and can report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. It uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant. We discuss artifacts in cdN&amp;B that are concentration&#8208;dependent and can distort the oligomerization curves, and we outline procedures that can correct for them. Using cdN&amp;B, we characterize the association of neuropilin&#8197;1 (NRP1), a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the embryonic cardiovascular and nervous systems. We show that NRP1 associates into a tetramer in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and we quantify the strength of the association. This work demonstrates the utility of cdN&amp;B as a powerful tool in biophysical chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential effect of the static surface tensor for metal alloy surfaces is found to be significantly larger than size&#8208;related effects as demonstrated by oxide shell and stabilizing ligand composition. Considering these finds, the free&#8208;energy equation related to solid&#8211;liquid phase transformation, under the classical nucleation theory, is extended to incorporate the stress&#8208;component resulting from the passivating shell.







Abstract
Undercooling metals relies on frustration of liquid&#8211;solid transition mainly by an increase in activation energy. Passivating oxide layers are a way to isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7&#8211;5&#8197;nm) oxide shell, slowing homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. We demonstrate that 1)&#8197;the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat&#8208;free solders, 2)&#8197;inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and 3)&#8197;the magnitude of the influence of the passivating oxide can be larger than size effects in undercooling.

         <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic properties of boron formazanate dyes are usually tuned by varying the substituents of the formazan moiety. We show that the wavelength and type of the lowest&#8208;energy electronic excitation of these compounds can also be modulated through variation of the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom.







Abstract
Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density&#8208;functional (DFT) calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the boron formazanate ring. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing optoelectronic materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles containing boron and other main&#8208;group elements.

         <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis&#8208;Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoconvergence is observed in the enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, where the selectivity factor for chiral copolymer formation significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted substrate at various conversions.







Abstract
Unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides was mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. Unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. Catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are strongly influenced by the phenolate ortho&#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality.

&lt;p&gt;Stereoconvergence is observed in the enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, where the selectivity factor for chiral copolymer formation significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted substrate at various conversions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides was mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. Unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. Catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are strongly influenced by the phenolate ortho&#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. An enantiopure binaphthol&#8208;linked bimetallic Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex allows stereoconvergent access to the stereoregular semi&#8208;crystalline polyesters and a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advancing the Logic of Chemical Synthesis: C&#8722;H Activation as Strategic and Tactical Disconnections for C&#8722;C Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of new synthetic methods has historically motivated the evolution of retrosynthetic logic. A significant recent advance is C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by C&#8722;H activation, but it has only seen modest application in synthesis. This Review compares traditional synthetic routes towards complex targets with reconceptualized ones utilizing C&#8722;H activation, highlighting the strategic advantages of this powerful approach.







Abstract
The design of synthetic routes by retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners. However, its uptake in total synthesis has been tepid, partially due to their apparent synthetic intractability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for implementation. This Review addresses these issues and offers a guide to identify retrosynthetic opportunities to generate C&#8722;C bonds by C&#8722;H activation processes. By comparing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches and recent C&#8722;H activation methods, this Review demonstrates how C&#8722;H activation enabled C&#8722;C bond construction has led to more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, shortcomings of existing processes are highlighted; this Review illustrates how some highlighted total syntheses can be further economized by adopting next&#8208;generation ligand&#8208;enabled approaches.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;Strong Acetylene Nano&#8208;trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 nano&#8208;trap features the synergistic effect of multiple open metal sites has been proposed for separating C2H2/CO2 mixture gas. The unique C2H2 nano&#8208;trap shows the strongest binding interaction with C2H2 and a benchmark for C2H2/CO2 separation. The binding mechanism for C2H2 was studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and molecular simulation studies.







Abstract
Porous materials with open metal sites have been investigated to separate various gas mixtures. However, open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C2H2/CO2. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C2H2 molecules and separate C2H2/CO2 mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark Qst of 79.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for C2H2, a record high pure C2H2 uptake of 2.54&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;bar, and the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C2H2 and the separation of C2H2/CO2. The locations of C2H2 molecules within the MOF&#8208;based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C2H2.

         <title>Droplet Microfluidics and Directed Evolution of Enzymes: an Intertwined Journey</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Evolution is essential to the appearance of complexity and ultimately Life. It relies on the propagation of the properties, traits and characteristics that allow an organism to survive in a challenging environment. It is evolution that shaped our world over about four billion years by slow and iterative adaptation. While natural evolution based on selection is slow and gradual, directed evolution allows the fast and streamlined optimization of a phenotype under selective conditions. The potential of directed evolution for the discovery and optimization of enzymes is mostly limited by the throughput of the tools and methods available for screening. Over the past twenty years, versatile tools based on droplet microfluidics have been developed to address the need for higher throughput. In this review, we provide a chronological overview of the intertwined development of microfluidics droplet&#8208;based compartmentalization methods and in vivo directed evolution of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to Primary Amines from Alkenes via Selective Metal&#8208;Free Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct and selective synthesis of primary amines from easily available precursors is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the rapid synthesis of primary amines from alkenes via metal free regioselective hydroamination at room temperature. Ammonium carbonate was used as ammonia surrogate for the first time, allowing for efficient conversion of terminal and internal alkenes into linear,  &#945;  &#8208;branched, and  &#945;  &#8208;tertiary primary amines under mild conditions. This method provides a straightforward and powerful approach to a wide spectrum of advanced, highly functionalized primary amines which are of particular interest in pharmaceutical chemistry and other areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Arenes&#8208;Based Conjugated Macrocycle Polymers for Highly Selective CO2 Capture and Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating synthetic macrocycles with unique structures and distinct conformations into conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMPs) can endow the resulting materials with great potentials in gas uptake and pollutant adsorption. Here, four CMPs (CMP&#8208;n, n = 1&#8208;4) capable of reversibly capturing iodine and efficiently separating carbon dioxide are constructed from&#160;per&#8208;triflate functionalized&#160;leaning tower[6]arene (LT6&#8208;OTf) and [2]biphenyl&#8208;extended pillar[6]arene (BpP6&#8208;OTf) via&#160;Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8208;Hagihara cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Intriguingly, owing to the appropriate cavity size of LT6&#8208;OTf and the numerous aromatic rings in the framework, the newly designed CMP&#8208;4 possesses an outstanding I2&#160;affinity with a large uptake capacity of 208 wt % in vapor and a great removal efficiency of 94% in aqueous solutions. To our surprise, with no capacity to accommodate nitrogen, CMP&#8208;2 constructed from BpP6&#8208;OTf is able to specifically capture carbon dioxide at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino Acid&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Base&#8208;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a strategy to develop heterogeneous single&#8208;site enantioselective catalysts based on naturally occurring amino acids and earth&#8208;abundant metals for eco&#8208;friendly asymmetric catalysis. The grafting of amino acids within the pores of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), followed by post&#8208;synthetic metalation with iron precursor affords highly active and enantioselective (&gt;99% ee for 10 examples) catalysts for hydrosilylation and hydroboration of carbonyl compounds. Impressively, the MOF&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed high turnover numbers of up to 10000 and was recycled and reused more than 15 times without diminishing the enantioselectivity. MOF&#8208;Fe displayed much higher activity and enantioselectivity than its homogeneous control catalyst, likely due to the formation of robust single&#8208;site catalyst in the MOF via site&#8208;isolation.</dc:description>

         <title>Segmented Polyurethane Elastomers with Mechanochromic and Self&#8208;strengthening Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanofunctional polymers that exhibit color change, fluorescence, and self&#8208;strengthening ability were developed by Hideyuki Otsuka et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015196). It is the first example of force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking reactions achieved by only the extension or compression of a bulk film. The cross&#8208;linking reaction can be visualized via color change and fluorescence and evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchronous and efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes is a challenging task in the field of photocatalysis. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013753), Baojiang Jiang, Honggang Fu et al. report the synthesis of ultrathin porous carbon nitride bundles for simultaneous solar photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting and selective phenylcarbinol oxidation. The bundles have adjustable band gaps (2.25&#8211;2.75 eV) and hollow microtubes with ultrathin pore walls.

A new ligand&#8208;directed approach for synthesizing lacunary polyoxomolybdates in organic solvents, which afforded an unprecedented lacunary polyoxomolybdate, is presented by Chifeng Li, Kazuya Yamaguchi, Kosuke Suzuki in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016642). By controlling the equilibrium of lacunary polyoxomolybdate ([&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;) with pyridine molecules in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, a selective structure transformation delivered the new lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722;.

         <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for &#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) serving as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy are reported by Omid&#8197;C. Farokhzad, Wei Tao, Tian Xie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016330). SnNSs could also serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy and &#946;&#8208;elemene delivery. This study not only presents a strategy for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri&#8208;modal combination cancer therapy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic structure of liquid water can be disrupted by the presence of non&#8208;polar organic molecules, in a process known as hydrophobic solvation. Maria Gim&#233;nez&#8208;L&#243;pez, Francisco Rivadulla et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015800) that the particular orientation of hydrocarbon chains in tetraalkylammonium and phosphonium salts induce a peculiar structure of water molecules different from the bulk, changing its physicochemical properties.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Engineered DNAzyme Sensor for Cell&#8208;Selective Imaging of Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;selective imaging of metal ions was achieved by Lele Li et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015979) by using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology. In the picture, the sensing activity is silent in normal cells and can be restored by an overexpressed enzyme in cancer cells through site&#8208;specific cleavage. The DNAzyme sensor allowed to distinguish metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from healthy cells both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitor is reported by Pedro&#8197;Jos&#233;&#8197;Barbosa Pereira, Richard&#8197;J. Payne, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015127). These inhibitors were rationally designed by hybridizing native sulfopeptide thrombin inhibitors from three different invertebrates: variegin from a bont tick, anophelin from the Anopeheles mosquito and TTI from the tsetse fly. When fused using bidirectional peptide synthesis and peptide ligation technologies the resulting hybrid inhibitors exhibited exquisite potency both in&#8197;vitro, with femtomolar inhibition constants and in an in&#8197;vivo model of thrombosis.

         <title>Two cryptic self&#8208;resistance mechanisms in Streptomyces tenebrarius reveal insights into the biosynthesis of apramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apramycin is a clinically promising aminoglycoside antibiotic (AGA). To date, mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and self&#8208;resistance of apramycin remain largely unknown. Here we report that apramycin biosynthesis proceeds through unexpected phosphorylation, deacetylation, and dephosphorylation steps, in which a novel aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (AprU), a putative creatinine amidohydrolase (AprP), and an alkaline phosphatase (AprZ) are involved. Biochemical characterization revealed that AprU specifically phosphorylates 5&#8208;OH of a pseudotrisaccharide intermediate, whose N&#8208;7&#8217; acetyl group is subsequently hydrolyzed by AprP. AprZ is located extracellularly where it removes the phosphate group from a pseudotetrasaccharide intermediate, leading to the maturation of apramycin. Intriguingly, 7&#8217;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylated and 5&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated apramycin that were accumulated in &#916;  aprU  and &#916;  aprZ  respectively exhibited significantly reduced antibacterial activities, implying  Streptomyces tenebrarius  employs C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8217; acetylation as two strategies to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity. Significantly, this study provides insight into the design of new generation AGAs to circumvent the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Frameworks (COFs) have recently emerged as light&#8208;harvesting devices, as well as elegant heterogeneous catalysts. The combination of these two properties into a dual catalyst has not been explored yet. Here, we report a new photosensitive triazine&#8208;based COF, decorated with single Ni&#8208;sites to form a dual catalyst. This crystalline and highly porous catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic sulfur&#8208;carbon cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The ability to incorporate single transition metal sites in a photosensitive COF scaffold which acts as a two&#8208;component synergistic catalyst in organic transformation is demonstrated for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Desymmetrization of Prochiral Cyclobutanones via Nitrogen Insertion: A Concise Route to Chiral &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric access to  &#947;  &#8208;lactams is achieved via a cyclobutanone ring expansion using widely available (1  S  ,2  R  )&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;indanol for chiral induction. Mechanistic analysis of the key  N,O  &#8208;ketal rearrangement reveals a downstream diastereo&#173;meric resolution (up to 88:12 dr), which enables the control over the distal stereocenter and is corroborated by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies. In combination with an easy deprotection protocol, this operationally simple sequence allows the synthesis of a range of optically pure  &#947;  &#8208;lactams, including those bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereo&#173;centers. In addition, the formal synthesis of drug molecules baclofen, brivaracetam, and pregabalin further demonstrates the synthetic utility and highlights the general applicability of the presented method.</dc:description>

         <title>The folding landscapes of human telomeric RNA and DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes are markedly different</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate here the folding kinetics of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. In particular, we compare K  +  &#8208;induced folding of an RNA G4 derived from the human telomeric repeat&#8208;containing RNA (TERRA25) with a sequence homologous DNA G4 (wtTel25) using CD spectroscopy and real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. The folding kinetics of RNA and DNA G4 are markedly different: while DNA G4 folding is biphasic, reveals kinetic partitioning and involves kinetically favoured off&#8208;pathway intermediates, RNA G4 folding is faster and monophasic. The differences in kinetics are correlated to the differences in the folded conformations of RNA vs DNA G4s, in particular with regard to the conformation around the glycosidic torsion angle &#967; that uniformly adopts  anti  conformations for RNA G4s and both,  syn  and  anti  conformation for DNA G4s. Modified DNA G4s with  19  F bound to C2&#8217; in arabino configuration adopt exclusively  anti  conformations for &#967;. These fluoro&#8208;modified DNA (antiTel25) reveal faster folding kinetics and monomorphic conformations similar to RNA G4s, suggesting the correlation between folding kinetics and pathways with differences in &#967; angle preferences in DNA and RNA, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Drug&#8208;Sponge Lipid Nanocarrier for in Situ Cargo Loading and Release Using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug&#8208;sponge nanocarrier that reversibly captures and releases drugs or contrast agents under pH control is developed using dynamic covalent chemistry. Inside this lipid droplet nano&#8208;reactor, lipophilic capture molecules transform free cargo&#8208;ketones into encapsulated hydrazone prodrugs, enabling the controlled release of active cargos and also their extraction from cells and tissues for detoxification.







Abstract
Currently, drug&#8208;delivery strategies using nanocarriers (NCs) deal with encapsulation of cargo or its covalently modified prodrug. Herein, we propose a concept of reversible pH&#8208;controlled capture and delivery of active cargo based on dynamic covalent chemistry inside lipid nano&#8208;droplets (nanoemulsions), coined as &#8220;drug sponge&#8221;. We designed a highly lipophilic hydrazide (LipoHD) capable of reacting with a free cargo&#8208;ketone (fluorescent dye and doxorubicin drug) directly inside lipid NCs, yielding a lipophilic hydrazone prodrug efficiently captured in the oil core. LipoHD&#8208;loaded NCs spontaneously accumulated cargo&#8208;ketones, yielding formulations stable against cargo leakage at pH&#8197;7.4, and further released their dye/drug cargo at low pH range (5.0&#8211;6.8) in solution and live cells. Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded drug&#8208;sponge NCs showed cytotoxicity in four cancer cell lines and capacity to inhibit tumor growth in subcutaneous xenografts of mice. Finally, unprecedented extraction of dye/drug cargos directly from cells and tissues (i.e. detoxification) was realized by the drug&#8208;sponge NCs.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Cs2AgInCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites such as the easily synthesized double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 have generated great attention as promising alternatives to lead&#8208;based counterparts. This Minireview takes a close look at Cs2AgInCl6 materials in the form of bulk crystals as well as nanocrystals in terms of doping engineering, photoluminescence modification, and fundamental theoretical understanding.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have drawn wide attention as alternatives to their toxic and poorly stable lead&#8208;based counterparts. Among them, double perovskites with Cs2AgInCl6 composition, often doped with various elements, have been in the spotlight owing to their intriguing optical properties, namely, self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards both crystals and nanocrystals, and the exploration of many alloy compositions with mono&#8208; and trivalent cations other than Ag+ and In3+. In this Minireview we describe the recent developments on Cs2AgInCl6 bulk crystals and nanocrystals, their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties, and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects. We also discuss progress on computational studies aimed at understanding the thermodynamic stability, the role of defects, and the origin of photoluminescence in relation to the STEs and the direct band gap character.

         <title>(Aza)Pentacenes Clipped into a Ring: Stabilization of Large (Aza)Acenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly alkylene bridged tetraazahexacene and (aza)pentacenes were synthesized, introducing an alternative and complementary method of stabilization of large (hetero)acenes to trialkylsilylalkynylation. The examined materials display superior photochemical and thermal stabilities compared to their TIPS&#8208;ethinyl substituted congeners.







Abstract
A doubly alkylene bridged 6,13&#8208;diphenylpentacene and analogously bridged azapentacenes were prepared; they are persistent. The doubly bridged azapentacenes display superior photochemical, oxidative and thermal stabilities compared to azapentacenes protected by bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituents&#8212;clipping an azaacene into a large ring is a viable complement in stabilization.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Planarized Triphenylamine&#8208;Based Linear Mixed&#8208;Valence Charge&#8208;Transfer Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel building blocks for mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer compounds: Planar N&#8208;heterotriangulene dimers with low reorganization energies and activation barriers for electron self&#8208;exchange have been synthesized and characterized.







Abstract
Three linear dimers with two redox&#8208;active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers, are of great interest. This process was thoroughly investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. A comparison of the key parameters of electron transfer with non&#8208;planarized nitrogen&#8208;centered building blocks emphasizes the impact of using redox centers with low internal reorganization energies. However, the distance&#8208;dependence attenuation factor of the super&#8208;exchange mechanisms remains similar.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Color, Bleaching&#8208;Resistant Super&#8208;Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging with Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Exchangeable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore labels that transiently bind to and unbind from a protein target allow photobleaching in super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) to be circumvented. Using short fluorophore&#8208;labeled DNA oligonucleotides, we demonstrate high&#8208;contrast, low&#8208;background, and multi&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging with SOFI.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.

         <title>Octagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene as a Chiral Motif for Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emission of Saddle&#8208;Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using &#960;&#8208;extended oct&#8208;[5]helicene as novel helical unit, a new family of saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is prepared. They are chiral and emissive compounds that become part of the still exclusive family of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;emissive nanographenes.







Abstract
We report a new family of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based helical nanographenes incorporating &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes bearing an octagonal carbocycle. This family represents a new kind of highly distorted saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes. For the first time, the eight&#8208;membered ring becomes a constituent of both a carbo[5]helicene and a HBC and thus, the negative curvature is responsible for twisting both units. This novel chiral motif, namely, oct&#8208;[5]helicene results in the largest torsion angle recorded so far for a carbo[5]helicene (&#952;=79.5&#176;), as it has been suggested by DFT&#8208;calculations and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Consequently, the barriers of isomerization become exceptionally high for a [5]helicene unsubstituted in the fjord region since neither racemization nor decomposition were observed at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 1 or 3 during 5&#8197;h. Therefore, racemic resolutions allowed subsequent chiroptical studies showing the ECD and CPL responses of this novel family of chiral nanographenes.

         <title>A Reagent for Amine&#8208;Directed Conjugation to IgG1 Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for site&#8208;directed conjugation to antibodies is developed, in which a first lysine both directs and activates the reagent for reaction with a neighboring lysine.







Abstract
Functionalized antibodies are an indispensable resource for diagnosis, therapy and as a research tool for chemical biology. However, simpler and better methodologies are often required to improve the labeling of antibodies in terms of selectivity and scalability. Herein, we report the development of an easily available chemical reagent that allows site&#8208;directed labeling of native human IgG1 antibodies in good yield and mono&#8208;labeling selectivity. The salicylaldehyde moiety of the reagent reacts with surface exposed lysine residues to transiently form an iminium ion, and this positions a semi&#8208;reactive ester in proximity of a second lysine residue that reacts with the ester to form an amide. Interestingly, it appears that the formation of the iminium ion also has a significant activating effect of the ester. We use flow cytometry and bio&#8208;layer interferometry to confirm that the labeled antibodies retain antigen binding.

         <title>Non&#8208;Coordinative Binding of O2 at the Active Center of a Copper&#8208;Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evidence suggests that the formylglycine generating enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed but not coordinated to the copper&#8208;center prior to any redox activity.







Abstract
Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.

         <title>Tunable eg Orbital Occupancy in Heusler Compounds for Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heusler compounds (Co2YZ) with mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions, are studied as a new class of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The eg orbital filling of active Co sites was precisely regulated by varying the Y and Z sites of the Co2YZ compounds, where the higher catalytic current was achieved for eg orbital filling approaching unity.







Abstract
Heusler compounds have potential in electrocatalysis because of their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co2YZ&#8208;type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co2YZ crystals was synthesized through the arc&#8208;melting method and the eg orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying Y and Z sites of the compound. A correlation between the eg orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found for Co2MnZ compounds (Z=Ti, Al, V, and Ga), whereby higher catalytic current was achieved for eg orbital filling approaching unity. A similar trend of eg orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other Heusler compounds (Co2VZ, Z=Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept in the application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalysts, and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performance.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols by Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkoxyallenes with Aldimine Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal catalysis was established for the asymmetric coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. This method resulted in the diastereodivergent synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs. The total synthesis of mycestericins F and G was demonstrated.







Abstract
Both syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols are common structural motifs in natural products, drug molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts. However, the currently available methods for synthesizing these motifs are limited to generate only one diastereoisomer. Therefore, development of a unified method for stereoselective access to complementary diastereomers would be highly desirable. Herein, we report a method for dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed diastereodivergent coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. By carefully selecting the two metals and appropriate chiral ligands, we could synthesize both syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the same set of starting materials. Furthermore, stereodivergent syntheses of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols could be achieved. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of this method by concisely synthesizing two &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol natural products, mycestericins F and G.

         <title>Ferric Heme Superoxide Reductive Transformations to Ferric Heme (Hydro)Peroxide Species: Spectroscopic Characterization and Thermodynamic Implications for H&#8208;Atom Transfer (HAT)</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic comparisons for O2&#8208;derived iron&#8208;porphyrinate interrelated ferric heme superoxide, peroxide, and hydroperoxide analogues in the presence and absence of an appended imidazolyl axial base are presented.







Abstract
A new end&#8208;on low&#8208;spin ferric heme peroxide, [(PIm)FeIII&#8722;(O22&#8722;)]&#8722; (PIm&#8208;P), and subsequently formed hydroperoxide species, [(PIm)FeIII&#8722;(OOH)] (PIm&#8208;HP) are generated utilizing the iron&#8208;porphyrinate PIm with its tethered axial base imidazolyl group. Measured thermodynamic parameters, the ferric heme superoxide [(PIm)FeIII&#8722;(O2&#8901;&#8722;)] (PIm&#8208;S) reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;) and the PIm&#8208;HP pKa value, lead to the finding of the OO&#8722;H bond&#8208;dissociation free energy (BDFE) of PIm&#8208;HP as 69.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 using a thermodynamic square scheme and Bordwell relationship. The results are validated by the observed oxidizing ability of PIm&#8208;S via hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) compared to that of the F8 superoxide complex, [(F8)FeIII&#8722;(O2.&#8722;)] (S) (F8=tetrakis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)porphyrinate, without an internally appended axial base imidazolyl), as determined from reactivity comparison of superoxide complexes PIm&#8208;S and S with the hydroxylamine (O&#8208;H) substrates TEMPO&#8208;H and ABNO&#8208;H.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Molecular Weight Photoswitchable Hydrogelators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small, photoswitchable (MW 258&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) arylazopyrazoles form self&#8208;assembled gels in water that can be reversibly cycled between a gel and solution state using two different excitation wavelengths that cause &#8220;thinning&#8221; of the gel fibers upon the light induced E to Z isomerisation. These materials could be used for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.







Abstract
Two photoswitchable arylazopyrozoles form hydrogels at a concentration of 1.2&#8201;% (w/v). With a molecular weight of 258.28&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, these are the lowest known molecular weight hydrogelators that respond reversibly to light. Photoswitching of the E&#8208; to the Z&#8208;form by exposure to 365&#8197;nm light results in a macroscopic gel&#8594;sol transition; nearly an order of magnitude reduction in the measured elastic and loss moduli. In the case of the meta&#8208;arylazopyrozole, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 29&#177;7&#8197;nm wide sheets in the E&#8208;gel state narrow to 13&#177;2&#8197;nm upon photoswitching to the predominantly Z&#8208;solution state. Photoswitching for meta&#8208;arylazopyrozole is reversible through cycles of 365&#8197;nm and 520&#8197;nm excitation with little fatigue. The release of a rhodamine&#8197;B dye encapsulated in gels formed by the arylazopyrozoles is accelerated more than 20&#8208;fold upon photoswitching with 365&#8197;nm light, demonstrating these materials are suitable for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azobenzenes and Azoxybenzenes by a Molecular Mo Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of azobenzene compounds and azoxybenzene compounds with N=N bonds was performed by a molecular molybdenum oxide compound [N(C4H9)4]2[Mo6O19] (simplified as Mo6) under mild conditions. A series of symmetric and asymmetric azobenzenes and azoxybenzenes were produced in high yield and selectivity by changing additive and solvent. Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of the reaction system was also assumed appropriately.







Abstract
Aromatic azo compounds, which play an important role in pharmaceutical and industrial applications, still face great challenges in synthesis. Herein, we report a molybdenum oxide compound, [N(C4H9)4]2[Mo6O19] (1), catalyzed selective oxidation of anilines with hydrogen peroxide as green oxidant. The oxidation of anilines can be realized in a fully selectively fashion to afford various symmetric/asymmetric azobenzene and azoxybenzene compounds, respectively, by changing additive and solvent, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest the intermediacy of highly active reactive and elusive Mo imido complexes.

         <title>Sensitive and Repeatable Photoinduced Luminescent Radicals from A&#8201;Simple Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous dual&#8208;channel switching of luminescence and conducting can be achieved from a simple organic crystal by UV irradiation, which is because of the sensitive and repeatable generation of photoinduced luminescent radicals inside.







Abstract
Photoinduced organic radicals are important for chemical and physical processes of organic materials, which are extensively investigated and applied in organic synthesis, photoelectronic devices and biotechnology. However, there are rare reports of the luminescence for these photoinduced radicals, especially in the condensed state.

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous dual&#8208;channel switching of luminescence and conducting can be achieved from a simple organic crystal by UV irradiation, which is because of the sensitive and repeatable generation of photoinduced luminescent radicals inside.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced organic radicals are important for chemical and physical processes of organic materials, which are extensively investigated and applied in organic synthesis, photoelectronic devices and biotechnology. However, there are rare reports of the luminescence for these photoinduced radicals, especially in the condensed state. Herein, an unexpected and interesting luminescent radical is described, which can be rapidly and reversibly generated from a simple organic crystal by gentle light irradiation in air. It was revealed that the twist and asymmetric conformation of isolated molecule in its crystal with only weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions, which led to the generation of such photoinduced luminescent radicals. In addition, dual&#8208;channel photosensitive device with rapid response and well repeatability can be obtained based on the thin film of this organic crystal, showing both photoswitching on luminescence and conducting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>An efficient electrochemical radical silyl&#8208;oxygenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is demonstrated, which gives access to a variety of new highly functionalized silicon&#8208;containing molecules, including &#946;&#8208;silyl&#8208;cyanohydrin derivatives in good yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity. This electrochemical radical silylation process conducts under mild conditions without the use of transition metal catalyst or chemical oxidant, and exhibits a wide scope of substrate silanes with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ability to access silyl radicals using electrochemical Si&#8211;H activation offers new perspectives for the synthesis of valuable organosilicon compounds in a sustainable and green manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascaded excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer towards near&#8208;infrared organic lasers beyond 850 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic solid&#8208;state lasers play an essential role in applications ranging from laser communication to infrared night vision, but progress in this area is restricted by the lack of effective excited&#8208;state gain processes. Herein, we originally proposed and demonstrated the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer for constructing the completely new energy systems. Cascading by the first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430 fs and the subsequent irreversible second proton transfer of ~1.6 ps, the stepwise proton transfer process favors the true six&#8208;level photophysical cycle, which supports efficient population inversion and thus NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854 nm. This work realizes longest wavelength beyond 850 nm of organic single&#8208;crystal lasing to date and originally exploits the cascaded excited&#8208;state molecular proton transfer energy level systems for organic solid&#8208;state lasers.</dc:description>

         <title>The sandarazols are cryptic and structurally unique plasmid encoded toxins from a rare myxobacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soil dwelling bacteria such as myxobacteria outcompete other microorganisms by using growth inhibitory secondary metabolites. In this work, we describe a new plasmid found in Sandaracinus sp. MSr10575 named pSa001 spanning 209.7 kbp that harbours a cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC). Activation of this BGC by homologous recombination mediated exchange of the native promoter sequence against a vanillate inducible system led to production and subsequent isolation and structure elucidation of novel secondary metabolites, the sandarazols A&#8208;G. The sandarazols contain intriguing structural features and very reactive functional groups such as an &#945;&#8208;chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone and a (2R)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)&#8208;propionic acid building block. &#160;In depth investigation of the underlying biosynthetic machinery led to a concise biosynthetic model for the new compound family, including several uncommon biosynthesis steps. The chlorinated congener sandarazol C shows an IC50 value of 0.5 &#181;M against HCT 116 cells and a MIC of 14 &#181;M against Mycobacterium smegmatis, which points at the sandarazols&#8217; potential function as defensive secondary metabolites or toxins.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate the ability of tetraalkylammonium borohydrides to capture large amounts of CO  2  , even at low CO  2  concentrations, and reduce it to formate under ambient conditions. These materials show CO  2  absorption capacities up to 30 mmol  CO2  g  &#8208;1  at room temperature and 1 bar CO  2  . Every BH  4  &#8211;  anion can react with three CO  2  molecules to form triformatoborohydride ([HB(OCHO)  3  ]  &#8211;  ). The thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction were monitored by a magnetic suspension balance. Direct CO  2  capture and reduction from air was achieved with tetraethyl, &#8208;propyl, and &#8208;butylammonium borohydride. The alkyl chain length played an important role in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction, especially in CO  2  diffusivity (crystallinity and free&#8208;volume), activation energy (charge transfer dependent on the alkyl chain), and hydrophobicity. Adding HCl gave formic acid and the corresponding chloride ammonium salt, which can be recycled. In addition, transfer of formate was achieved for  N  &#8208;formylation of amine.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual catalytic role of 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was revealed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones under a metal&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;free method. By means of a double&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer process, TBD activates the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, avoiding the necessity of an alkali metal. Most importantly, TBD enhances the activity of the peroxide intermediate through the double hydrogen bonds, allowing reduction by DMSO in the absence of a phosphine reductant.







Abstract
The critical role of double hydrogen bonds was addressed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones catalyzed by 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD), in the absence of either a metal catalyst or phosphine reductant. Experimental and theoretical investigations were performed to study the mechanism. In addition to initiating the reaction by proton abstraction, a more important role of TBD was revealed, that is, to enhance the oxidizing ability of peroxide intermediates, allowing DMSO to be used rather than commonly used phosphine reductants. Further characterizations with nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) confirmed the presence of double hydrogen bonds between TBD and the ketone, and kinetic studies suggested the attack of dioxygen on the TBD&#8208;enol adduct to be the rate&#8208;determining step. This work should encourage the application of TBD as a catalyst for oxidations.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Transformable Ferrous Ion Delivery System for Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;triggered transformable ferrous ion (Fe2+) delivery agent (LET&#8208;6) was developed for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Thermal expansion caused by 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation triggers the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe2+, which primes the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment, thus generating .OH for enhanced CDT. This high&#8208;performance Fe2+ delivery system provides a sound basis for future synergistic metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) involves the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Fe2+ is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side&#8208;effects. Therefore, the development of a controllable Fe2+ delivery system is a challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity, and improve therapeutic efficacy. Reported here is a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered Fe2+ delivery agent (LET&#8208;6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modality imaging guided, photothermal primed CDT. Thermal expansion caused by 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation triggers the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe2+ from its hydrophobic layer, which primes the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment, thus generating .OH for enhanced CDT. LET&#8208;6 shows remarkable therapeutic effects, both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100&#8201;% tumor elimination after just one treatment. This high&#8208;performance Fe2+ delivery system provides a sound basis for future synergistic metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.

         <title>Adaptive Chirality of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework for Chirality Induction in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral supramolecular organic framework (SOF) exhibits adaptive chirality with dual circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence responses when meeting various chiral guests, including L&#8208;/D&#8208;Phe, adenosine derivatives, and peptides/proteins via chirality induction in water. The adaptive chirality of the SOF can be used as a chiroptical platform to determine the enantiopurity, develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish peptides/proteins.







Abstract
Chiral framework materials have been developed for many applications including chiral recognition, chiral separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical materials. Herein, we report that an achiral cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (SOF&#8208;1) with the dynamic rotational conformation of tetraphenylethene units can exhibit adaptive chirality to produce M&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 or P&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 with mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism (CD) with gabs&#8776;&#177;10&#8722;4 and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with glum&#8776;&#177;10&#8722;4 induced by L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine in water, respectively. The chirality induction in CD (gabs&#8776;&#8722;10&#8722;4) and CPL (glum&#8776;&#8722;10&#8722;4) of P&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 from achiral SOF&#8208;1 can be presented by using a small amount of adenosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate disodium (ATP) or adenosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;diphosphate disodium (ADP) (only 0.4&#8197;equiv) in water. Furthermore, the adaptive chirality of SOF&#8208;1 can be used to determine dipeptide sequences (e.g., Phe&#8208;Ala and Ala&#8208;Phe) and distinguish polypeptides/proteins (e.g., somatostatin and human insulin) with characteristic CD spectra. Therefore, achiral SOF&#8208;1 as an ideal chiroptical platform with adaptive chirality may be applied to determine the enantiopurity of amino acids (e.g., L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine), develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish biological chiral macromolecules (e.g., peptides/proteins) via chirality induction in water.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Measurement of Osmotic Pressures by FRET Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel osmotic pressure sensor based on liposomes loaded with FRET dyes is developed, which experience volume changes responding to osmotic pressure due to water outflux through their semipermeable membrane. With FRET microscopy, measurement of osmotic pressures in situ with spatiotemporal resolution is demonstrated, which has not been achieved so far.







Abstract
Osmotic pressures (OPs) play essential roles in biological processes and numerous technological applications. However, the measurement of OP in situ with spatiotemporal resolution has not been achieved so far. Herein, we introduce a novel kind of OP sensor based on liposomes loaded with water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes exhibiting resonance energy transfer (FRET). The liposomes experience volume changes in response to OP due to water outflux. The FRET efficiency depends on the average distance between the entrapped dyes and thus provides a direct measure of the OP surrounding each liposome. The sensors exhibit high sensitivity to OP in the biologically relevant range of 0&#8211;0.3&#8197;MPa in aqueous solutions of salt, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. With the help of FRET microscopy, we demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal OP imaging, which can be a promising new tool to investigate phenomena involving OPs and their dynamics in biology and technology.

         <title>Highly Colored Boron&#8208;Doped Thiazolothiazoles from the Reductive Dimerization of Boron Isothiocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the reduction of cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized isothiocyanatoboranes in the presence of a Lewis base yields tricoordinate isothiocyanatoborylenes, the reduction in the absence of a Lewis base yields the first examples of deep blue, boron&#8208;doped, aromatic thiazolothiazoles.







Abstract
Reduction of (CAAC)BBr2(NCS) (CAAC=cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene) in the presence of a Lewis base&#8197;L yields tricoordinate (CAAC)LB(NCS) borylenes which undergo reversible E/Z&#8208;isomerization. The same reduction in the absence of L yields deep blue, bis(CAAC)&#8208;stabilized, boron&#8208;doped, aromatic thiazolothiazoles resulting from the dimerization of dicoordinate (CAAC)B(NCS) borylene intermediates.

         <title>The Role of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks in Electronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that respond to physical and chemical stimuli are promising materials for electronic sensors owing to their outstanding sensing performance. In this Review, the functionality of MOFs as a mass&#8208;loaded layer, filtration layer, electronic function layer, and optical sensitive layer is discussed.







Abstract
MOFs have a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, high surface area, nanoporosity with tunable size and shape, reliable host&#8211;guest interactions, and responsiveness to physical and chemical stimuli which can be exploited to address critical issues in sensor applications. On the one hand, the nanoscale pore size of MOFs ranging from less than 1&#8197;nm to &#8776;&#8197;10&#8197;nm not only allows the diffusion of small molecules into the pores or through the MOF layer, but also excludes other larger molecules depending on the size, shape, and conformation of MOFs. On the other hand, MOFs with flexible structure exhibit a dynamic response to external stimuli, including guest molecules, temperature, pressure, pH, and light. Due to the unsaturated coordination metal sites and active functional groups, the interaction between certain analytes and active sites results in high selectivity. In this review, we summarize the latest studies on MOF&#8208;based electronic sensors in terms of the function of MOFs, discuss challenges, and suggest perspectives.

&lt;p&gt;MOFs have a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, high surface area, nanoporosity with tunable size and shape, reliable host&#8211;guest interactions, and responsiveness to physical and chemical stimuli which can be exploited to address critical issues in sensor applications. On the one hand, the nanoscale pore size of MOFs ranging from less than 1&#8197;nm to &#8776;&#8197;10&#8197;nm not only allows the diffusion of small molecules into the pores or through the MOF layer, but also excludes other larger molecules depending on the size, shape, and conformation of MOFs. On the other hand, MOFs with flexible structure exhibit a dynamic response to external stimuli, including guest molecules, temperature, pressure, pH, and light. Due to the unsaturated coordination metal sites and active functional groups, the interaction between certain analytes and active sites results in high selectivity. In this review, we summarize the latest studies on MOF&#8208;based electronic sensors in terms of the function of MOFs, discuss challenges, and suggest perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Probing Transient DNA Conformation Changes with an Intercalative Fluorescent Excimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA intercalator, K21, can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA. The ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer was strongly correlated to DNA transient conformation stability. The K21 excimer can probe transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various length and shape. This label&#8208;free method can also probe the transient conformation change in single plasmid under supercoiled and open&#8208;circular states.







Abstract
Variation of DNA conformation is important in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, directly probing transient DNA conformation changes is challenging owing to the dynamic nature of this process. We show a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA; the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in numerous DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotide mutation at random position. We analyzed the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe transient conformation changes of DNA structures and has potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.

         <title>Paired Copper Monomers in Zeolite Omega: The Active Site for Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction along with support from theory and other X&#8208;ray techniques, the active copper site for methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion in zeolite omega has been determined spatially and quantitatively.







Abstract
The direct conversion of methane to methanol using oxygen is a challenging but potentially rewarding pathway towards utilizing methane. By using a stepwise chemical looping approach, copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites can convert methane to methanol, but productivity is still too low for viable implementation. However, if the nature of the active site could be elucidated, that information could be used to design more effective catalysts. By employing anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with support from theory and other X&#8208;ray techniques, we have derived a quantitative and spatial description of the highly selective, active copper sites in zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega). This is the first comprehensive description of the structure of non&#8208;copper&#8208;oxo active species and will provide a pivotal model for future development for materials for methane to methanol conversion.

         <title>Structural revision of natural cyclic depsipeptide MA026 established by total synthesis and biosynthetic gene cluster analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A revised structure of natural 14&#8208;mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from  Pseudomonas  sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS and NMR and confirmed by its total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, were assigned in error and have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity similar to that of the natural one in a cell&#8208;based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (~90%) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin&#8208;1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically re&#8208;organized collagen fiber bundles transmit mechanical signals and induce strongly correlated cell migration and self&#8208;organization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Correlated cell migration in fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) is important in many biological processes. During migration, cells can remodel the ECM, leading to the formation of mesoscale structures such as fiber bundles. However, how such mesoscale structures regulate correlated single&#8208;cells migration remains to be elucidated. Here, using a quasi&#8208;3D  in vitro  model, we investigate how collagen fiber bundles are dynamically re&#8208;organized and guide cell migration. By combining laser ablation technique with 3D tracking and active&#8208;particle simulations, we definitively show that only the re&#8208;organized fiber bundles that carry significant tensile forces can guide strongly correlated cell migration, providing for the first time a direct experimental evidence supporting that matrix&#8208;transmitted long&#8208;range forces can regulate cell migration and self&#8208;organization. This force regulation mechanism can provide new insights for studies on cellular dynamics, fabrication or selection of biomedical materials in tissue repairing, and many other biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress and Perspective on Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts toward Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fuel cell is an incredibly powerful renewable energy technology, but its broad range of applications remain lagging because of the high cost and poor reliability of cathodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This review focuses on the recent progress of ORR electrocatalysts in the fuel cells. More importantly, it highlights the fundamental problems associated with the insufficient activity translation from rotating disk electrode and membrane electrode assembly in the fuel cells. Finally, for the atomic&#8208;level in&#8208;depth information on ORR catalysts in fuel cells, potential perspectives are suggested, including large&#8208;scale preparation, unified assessment criteria, advanced interpretation techniques, advanced simulation and artificial intelligence. This work would, in fact, provide valuable insights into the fundamental science and technical engineering for efficient ORR electrocatalysts in fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Pore Space Partition Combined with High&#8208;Density H&#8208;Bonding Acceptor within a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly&#8208;Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high storage capacity versus high selectivity trade&#8208;off barrier keeps a daunting challenge for addressing practical acetylene (C  2  H  2  ) adsorbent. A structure&#8208;performance relationship screening for sixty&#8208;two high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;organic framework adsorbents reveals that a moderate pore size distribution around 5.0&#8211;7.5 &#197; is critical to fulfill this task. Motivated by this inspiration, a precise pore space partition approach was involved to partition 1D hexagonal channels of typical MIL&#8208;88 architecture into finite segments with pore sizes varying from 4.5 &#197; (SNNU&#8208;26) to 6.4 &#197; (SNNU&#8208;27), 7.1 &#197; (SNNU&#8208;28), and 8.1 &#197; (SNNU&#8208;29). Coupled with bare tetrazole N sites (6 or 12 bare N sties within one cage) as high&#8208;density H&#8208;bonding acceptors for C  2  H  2  , the target MOFs offer a good combination of high C  2  H  2  /CO  2  adsorption selectivity and high C  2  H  2  uptake capacity in addition to good stability. Especially, the optimized SNNU&#8208;27&#8208;Fe material demonstrates super C  2  H  2  uptake of 182.4 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  and extraordinary C  2  H  2  /CO  2  dynamic breakthrough time up to 91 min g  &#8208;1  under ambient conditions, thus outperforms all benchmark MOF adsorbents and represents a promising material for practical C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unified Approach to Furan Natural Products via Phosphine&#8211;Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyalkyl furans are widespread in Nature, often performing important biological roles. Despite a plethora of methods for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans, the construction of tetraalkyl furans remains non&#8208;trivial. The prevalence of alkyl groups in bioactive furan natural products, combined with the desirable bioactivities of tetraalkyl furans, calls for a general synthetic protocol for polyalkyl furans. This paper describes a Michael&#8211;Heck approach, using sequential phosphine&#8211;palladium catalysis, for the preparation of various polyalkyl furans from readily available precursors. The versatility of this method is illustrated by the total syntheses of nine distinct polyalkylated furan natural products belonging to different classes, namely the furanoterpenes rosefuran, sesquirosefuran, and mikanifuran; the marine  natural products plakorsins A, B, and D and plakorsin D methyl ester; and the furan fatty acids 3D5 and hydromumiamicin.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and spectroscopic comparison of soft&#8208;Se vs hard&#8208;O donor bonding in trivalent americium/neodymium molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalency is often considered to be an influential factor in driving An  3+  vs Ln  3+  selectivity invoked by soft donor ligands. This is intensely debated, particularly the extent to which An  3+  /Ln  3+  covalency differences prevail and manifest as the f&#8208;block is traversed, particularly the effects of periodic breaks beyond Pu. Herein, two Am complexes, [Am{N(E=PPh  2  )  2  }  3  ] (  1&#8209;Am  , E = Se;  2&#8209;Am  , E = O), with  1&#8209;Am  featuring the first molecular Am&#8211;Se bonds, are compared to isoradial [Nd{N(E=PPh  2  )  2  }  3  ] (  1&#8209;Nd  ,  2&#8209;Nd  ) complexes. Covalent contributions are assessed and compared to known U/La and Pu/Ce analogues. Through  ab initio  calculations grounded in UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we observe differences in f&#8208;orbital involvement between Am&#8211;Se and Nd&#8211;Se bonds, which are not present for O congeners.</dc:description>

         <title>Spinning Polyhedral Oligosilsesquioxanes in Functional Nanoassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of giant molecular nanoparticles with atomic precision into chiral nanoassemblies facilitates the fabrication of functional ordered phases with supramolecular chirality, which however remains major mysterious. Here we report the first example of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) derivatives that self&#8208;assembled into well&#8208;defined chiral nanoassemblies. POSS was covalently conjugated to N&#8208;terminal aromatic amino acids, which self&#8208;assembled into nanohelices and twists with explicit handedness tuned by solvent polarity. Chiral nanoassemblies showed active chiroptical responses including Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence. Such chiral systems were capable of including guest molecules by charge&#8208;transfer interaction, whereby self&#8208;assembled structures, chiroptical activities and luminescent colors could be further modulated. The unique coassembly systems were applied for instant information encryption and storage with multiple luminescent displays. This work paves a new protocol to design functional chiral materials of POSS via molecular self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanospace Engineering of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Dynamic Spacer Installation of Multi&#8208;functionalities for Efficient Separation of Ethane from Ethane/Ethylene Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of ethane from ethane/ethylene mixture is imperative and extremely challenging process in petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, a dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been implemented to construct a series of multi&#8208;functional MOFs, LIFM&#8208;61/31/62/63, with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. In this respect, a series of linear dicarboxylic acids were deliberately installed in the prototype MOF, LIFM&#8208;28, leading to a dramatically increased pore volume (from 0.41 to 0.82 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  ) and reduced pore size (from 11.1 &#215; 11.1 &#197;  2  to 5.6 &#215;5.6 &#197;  2  ). The increased pore volume endows the multi&#8208;functional MOFs with much higher ethane adsorption capacity, especially for LIFM&#8208;63 (4.8 mmol g  &#8208;1  ), representing nearly three times as much ethane as the prototypical counterpart (1.7 mmol g  &#8208;1  ) at 273 K and 1 bar. Meanwhile, the reduced pore size imparts enhanced ethane/ethylene selectivity to the multi&#8208;functional MOFs. Theoretical calculations and dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the DSI is a promising approach for rational design of multi&#8208;functional MOFs for this challenging task.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables simultaneous spatial mapping for diverse molecules in biological tissues. Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) has been a mainstream MSI method for a wide range of biomolecules. However, MALDI&#8208;MSI of biological homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock is limited by, e.g., preferential ionization for certain molecular classes. Matrix&#8208;free nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays (NAPAs) is an emerging laser desorption ionization (LDI) platform with ultra&#8208;trace sensitivity and molecular imaging capabilities. Here, we show complementary analysis and MSI of polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB), polyglutamic acid (PGA), and polysaccharide oligomers in soybean root nodule sections by NAPA&#8208;LDI and MALDI. For PHB, number and weight average molar mass, polydispersity, and oligomer size distributions across the tissue section and in regions of interest were characterized by NAPA&#8208;LDI&#8208;MSI.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Access to an Active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH Electrocatalyst for Durable Water Oxidation Derived From an Intermetallic Nickel Germanide Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A xanthene&#8208;based bis(germylene)&#8208;Ni complex is used as a molecular precursor for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;small NiGe nanostructures, which can generate a &#947;&#8208;NiOOH structure with intercalated species. This displays exceptional catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
Identifying novel classes of precatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER by water oxidation) with enhanced catalytic activity and stability is a key strategy to enable chemical energy conversion. The vast chemical space of intermetallic phases offers plenty of opportunities to discover OER electrocatalysts with improved performance. Herein we report intermetallic nickel germanide (NiGe) acting as a superior activity and durable Ni&#8208;based electro(pre)catalyst for OER. It is produced from a molecular bis(germylene)&#8208;Ni precursor. The ultra&#8208;small NiGe nanocrystals deposited on both nickel foam and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes showed lower overpotentials and a durability of over three weeks (505&#8197;h) in comparison to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and benchmark NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts under identical alkaline OER conditions. In contrast to other Ni&#8208;based intermetallic precatalysts under alkaline OER conditions, an unexpected electroconversion of NiGe into &#947;&#8208;NiIIIOOH with intercalated OH&#8722;/CO32&#8722; transpired that served as a highly active structure as shown by various ex&#8197;situ methods and quasi in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy.

     alt="Facile Access to an Active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH Electrocatalyst for Durable Water Oxidation Derived From an Intermetallic Nickel Germanide Precursor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A xanthene&#8208;based bis(germylene&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Ni complex is used as a molecular precursor for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;small NiGe nanostructures, which can generate a &#947;&#8208;NiOOH structure with intercalated species. This displays exceptional catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying novel classes of precatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER by water oxidation) with enhanced catalytic activity and stability is a key strategy to enable chemical energy conversion. The vast chemical space of intermetallic phases offers plenty of opportunities to discover OER electrocatalysts with improved performance. Herein we report intermetallic nickel germanide (NiGe) acting as a superior activity and durable Ni&#8208;based electro(pre)catalyst for OER. It is produced from a molecular bis(germylene)&#8208;Ni precursor. The ultra&#8208;small NiGe nanocrystals deposited on both nickel foam and fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes showed lower overpotentials and a durability of over three weeks (505&#8197;h) in comparison to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and benchmark NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts under identical alkaline OER conditions. In contrast to other Ni&#8208;based intermetallic precatalysts under alkaline OER conditions, an unexpected electroconversion of NiGe into &#947;&#8208;Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;OOH with intercalated OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; transpired that served as a highly active structure as shown by various ex&#8197;situ methods and quasi in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>Here we report a bio&#8208;adhesive porous organic module (  Glue  COF) composed of hexagonally packed 1D nanopores based on a covalent organic framework.&#160;&#160;The nanopores are densely appended with guanidinium ion (Gu  +  ) pendants capable of salt&#8208;bridging with oxyanionic species.&#160;&#160;Because oxyanionic species are ubiquitously present in biopolymers,&#160;  Glue  COF strongly adheres to biopolymers via a multivalent salt&#8208;bridging interaction.&#160;&#160;By taking advantage of its strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature, we &#160;succeeded in&#160; creating a gate that possibly opens the nanopores via a selective interaction with&#160; a reporter chemical &#160;and releases guest molecules .&#160;&#160; We chose calmodulin (CaM) as a gating component that can stably entrap a loaded guest, sulforhodamine B (SRB), within the nanopores (  CaM  COF &#8835; SRB).&#160;&#160;CaM is known to change its conformation via selective binding&#160; with&#160; Ca  2+  .&#160;&#160;We confirmed that, upon mixing with Ca  2+  ,&#160;  CaM  COF &#8835; SRB released SRB from its nanopores, whereas the use of weakly binding &#160; Mg  2+  &#160;resulted in much slower release of SRB.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroesterification of Diarylmethyl Carbinols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient asymmetric hydroesterfication of diarylmethyl carbinols is developed with a Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst, resulting in a series of chiral 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins in excellent enantioselectivities and good yields. The method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, use of easily accessible starting materials, and low palladium loadings. A plausible stereochemical model is proposed with the Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient asymmetric hydroesterfication of diarylmethyl carbinols is developed for the first time with a Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst, resulting in a series of chiral 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins in excellent enantioselectivities and good yields. The method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, use of easily accessible starting materials, and low palladium loadings. A plausible stereochemical model is also proposed with the Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst. This method has enabled a 4&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;tolterodine from readily available starting materials.

         <title>Poly(Alkyl&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) Ionomers and Membranes with an Outstanding Alkaline&#8208;Membrane Fuel&#8208;Cell Performance of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2</title>

         <dc:description>
Poly(alkyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) membranes and ionomers display outstanding hydrogen&#8208;barrier properties and mechanical properties as well as excellent hydroxide&#8208;ion conductivity that results in an excellent power density of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.38&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in H2/O2 and H2/air, respectively, along with a new, outstanding specific power in alkaline&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;free anion&#8208;exchange ionomers (AEIs) and membranes (AEMs) have become an important benchmark to address the insufficient durability and power&#8208;density issues associated with AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we present aliphatic chain&#8208;containing poly(diphenyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) (PDTP) copolymers to reduce the phenyl content and adsorption of AEIs and to increase the mechanical properties of AEMs. Specifically, PDTP AEMs possess excellent mechanical properties (storage modulus&gt;1800&#8197;MPa, tensile strength&gt;70&#8197;MPa), H2 fuel&#8208;barrier properties (&lt;10&#8197;Barrer), good ion conductivity, and ex&#8208;situ stability. Meanwhile, PDTP AEIs with low phenyl content and high&#8208;water permeability display excellent peak power densities (PPDs). The present AEMFCs reach outstanding PPDs of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&gt;7.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density) and 1.38&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in H2/O2 and H2/air, respectively, along with a specific power (PPD/catalyst loading) over 8&#8197;W&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which is the highest record for Pt&#8208;based AEMFCs so far.

         <title>Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals with Metastable Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a strong interest in developing metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;controlled shapes while featuring metastable crystal structures. The unconventional crystal phases not only enrich the diversity and functionality of nanomaterials but also enhance their catalytic properties.







Abstract
In addition to the conventional knobs such as composition, size, shape, and defect structure, the crystal structure (or phase) of metal nanocrystals offers a new avenue for engineering their properties. Various strategies have recently been developed for the fabrication of colloidal metal nanocrystals in metastable phases different from their bulk counterparts. With a focus on noble metals, we begin with a brief introduction to their atomic packing, followed by a discussion about five major synthetic approaches to their colloidal nanocrystals in unconventional phases. We then highlight the success of synthesis in terms of mechanistic insights and experimental controls, as well as the enhanced catalytic properties. We end this Minireview with perspectives on the remaining issues and future opportunities.

         <title>Design of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Molecular Probes for Hyperpolarized Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear hyperpolarization is a powerful method that can dramatically enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy. This technology has been applied to the biomedical molecular imaging of a range of small molecules with stable isotopes and has provided valuable metabolic and physiological information. This review focuses on strategies for the design of molecular probes for hyperpolarized bioimaging.







Abstract
Nuclear hyperpolarization has emerged as a method to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy. By application of this powerful tool, small molecules with stable isotopes have been used for highly sensitive biomedical molecular imaging. The recent development of molecular probes for hyperpolarized in vivo analysis has demonstrated the ability of this technique to provide unique metabolic and physiological information. This review presents a brief introduction of hyperpolarization technology, approaches to the rational design of molecular probes for hyperpolarized analysis, and examples of molecules that have met with success in vitro or in vivo.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Synthesis of Sulfonamides Directly from (Hetero)arenes, SO2, and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent single&#8208;step synthesis of sulfonamides directly from (hetero)arenes, SO2, and amines by electrochemical C&#8722;H activation is presented. No prefunctionalization of the aromatic compound is required and halogen substituents are tolerated. The in situ formation of the amidosulfinate species serves a dual role as nucleophile and supporting electrolyte.







Abstract
Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non&#8208;prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO2 and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP&#8211;MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36&#8197;examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85&#8201;%.

         <title>A Cisplatin&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Mitochondrial Platinum Accumulation in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time cisplatin trafficking: A mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe was engineered to detect the clinically&#8208;important platinum drug cisplatin in real&#8208;time. The probe was applied to investigate the mitochondria as cellular targets for cisplatin and its analogues. Two distinct pathways whereby Pt complexes could be delivered to mitochondria after cell entry were uncovered.







Abstract
Mitochondria have emerged as important targets for cisplatin in cancer therapy. Apart from cisplatin, anticancer Pt complexes based on similar scaffolds have also been developed to target mitochondria. Yet cellular processing of cisplatin or these mitochondria&#8208;targeting Pt analogues remained unexplored, largely due to a lack of tools capable of probing these Pt drugs within an intracellular environment. We developed the first mitochondria&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt accumulation in mitochondria. We applied the probe to investigate mitochondria as cellular targets for Pt drug complexes and uncovered two distinct pathways whereby these Pt complexes could be delivered to mitochondria after cell entry.

         <title>Self&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Carbon Nanoplates for Selective Separation of CH4/N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;pillared ultramicroporous carbon nanoplates have been prepared via a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential condensation, which exhibit a high selectivity and fast diffusion kinetics for CH4/N2 separation.







Abstract
There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, that is, in 10&#8197;min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH4/N2 selectivity up to 24 at a low CH4 partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH4 diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.

         <title>An Integrated Electrochemical Nanodevice for Intracellular RNA Collection and Detection in Single Living Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DSN&#8208;assisted ICR&#8208;nanopipette was fabricated for tracking the drug&#8208;induced variation of the oncogenic miR&#8208;10b expression levels of a dynamic manner. This method unveils the ability of electrochemistry to probe intracellular RNA and to study the gene expression and heterogeneous complexity under physiological conditions down to single&#8208;cell level.







Abstract
New tools for single&#8208;cell interrogation enable deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and associated cellular behaviors and functions. Information of RNA expression in single cell could contribute to our knowledge of the genetic regulatory circuits and molecular mechanism of disease development. Although significant progresses have been made for intracellular RNA analysis, existing methods have a trade&#8208;off between operational complexity and practical feasibility. We address this challenge by combining the ionic current rectification property of nanopipette reactor with duplex&#8208;specific nuclease&#8208;assisted hybridization chain reaction for signal amplification to realize a simple and practical intracellular nanosensor with minimal invasiveness, which enables single&#8208;cell collection and electrochemical detection of intracellular RNA with cell&#8208;context preservation. Systematic studies on differentiation of oncogenic miR&#8208;10b expression levels in non&#8208;malignant breast cells, metastatic breast cancer cells as well as non&#8208;metastatic breast cancer cells were then realized by this nanotool accompanied by assessment of different drugs effects. This work has unveiled the ability of electrochemistry to probe intracellular RNA and opened new opportunities to study the gene expression and heterogeneous complexity under physiological conditions down to single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Macrolides Involving Cycles of Extracellular Oxidative Activation and Intracellular Reductive Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;resistance mechanism involving a cycle of extracellular oxidative activation and intracellular reductive inactivation was revealed by identifying the biosynthesis pathway of the macrolide antibiotic A26771B (1). This finding not only expands the understanding of resistance toward macrolide antibiotics, but also guides efforts to develop new antibiotics.







Abstract
Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Herein, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (1), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus Penicillium egyptiacum. A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a trans&#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a cytochrome P450 and an acyltransferase, respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone&#8197;E (2). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms 1, while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms 2, forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.

         <title>A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in Vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity Against Tumours</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo detection of natural killer (NK) cell activity against tumours was achieved with an activatable chemiluminescent probe containing a granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;reactive peptide substrate linked to a phenoxydioxetane scaffold through a p&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol linker. The rapid and specific chemiluminescence response of the probe was used to detect NK cell activity against breast cancer cells in living mice.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that can kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti&#8208;tumour activity of NK cells in&#8197;vivo. Herein, we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image in&#8197;situ the granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence. The probe shows high selectivity for active granzyme&#8197;B over other proteases and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios than commercial fluorophores. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe can detect NK cell activity in mouse models, being the first chemiluminescent probe for in&#8197;vivo imaging of NK cell activity in live tumours.

     alt="A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in Vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity Against Tumours"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vivo detection of natural killer (NK) cell activity against tumours was achieved with an activatable chemiluminescent probe containing a granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;reactive peptide substrate linked to a phenoxydioxetane scaffold through a &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol linker. The rapid and specific chemiluminescence response of the probe was used to detect NK cell activity against breast cancer cells in living mice.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that can kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti&#8208;tumour activity of NK cells in&#8197;vivo. Herein, we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image in&#8197;situ the granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme&#8197;B&#8208;specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence.

         <title>Cysteine Nucleophiles in Glycosidase Catalysis: Application of a Covalent &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;Arabinofuranosidase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidases are thought to make use of a unique zinc&#8208;associated cysteine nucleophile to catalyze glycoside hydrolysis. Using a bespoke synthetic covalent inhibitor, this proposed mechanism is put to the test. Mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and mechanistic simulations support the formation of a thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate and reveal how the enzyme facilitates CS bond cleavage.







Abstract
The recent discovery of zinc&#8208;dependent retaining glycoside hydrolases (GHs), with active sites built around a Zn(Cys)3(Glu) coordination complex, has presented unresolved mechanistic questions. In particular, the proposed mechanism, depending on a Zn&#8208;coordinated cysteine nucleophile and passing through a thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate, remains controversial. This is primarily due to the expected stability of the intermediate C&#8722;S bond. To facilitate the study of this atypical mechanism, we report the synthesis of a cyclophellitol&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidase inhibitor, hypothesised to react with the catalytic nucleophile to form a non&#8208;hydrolysable adduct analogous to the mechanistic covalent intermediate. This &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;arabinofuranosidase inhibitor reacts exclusively with the proposed cysteine thiol catalytic nucleophiles of representatives of GH families 127 and 146. X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined for the resulting adducts enable MD and QM/MM simulations, which provide insight into the mechanism of thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate breakdown. Leveraging the unique chemistry of cyclophellitol derivatives, the structures and simulations presented here support the assignment of a zinc&#8208;coordinated cysteine as the catalytic nucleophile and illuminate the finely tuned energetics of this remarkable metalloenzyme clan.

         <title>Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cool frustration: Engineering composition across a thin surface oxide layer of a metal particle, and stabilizing it with appropriate ligands, leads to a sharp surface stress that frustrates solidification. Chemical potential gradients from compositional variation and ligand inductive effects all contribute to stabilization of a metastable state. An undercooled liquid metal particle is formed, highlighting a new paradigm in engineering energy landscape of a material using thin surface layer, as described by Martin Thuo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013489).

         <title>A Superstrong and Reversible Ionic Crystal&#8208;based Adhesive Inspired by Ice Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we developed a superstrong and reversible adhesive, which can possess a high bonding strength in the "adhesive" state and detach with the application of heating. An ionic crystal (IC) gel, in which an IC was immobilized within a soft&#8208;polymer matrix, were synthesized via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking of a precursor solution composed of N, N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA) and a melted IC. The obtained IC gel is homogenous and transparent at melt point. When cooled to the phase transition temperature of the IC, the gel turns into the adhesive with the adhesion strength of 5.82 MPa (on glasses), due to the excellent wetting of melted gel and a thin layer of crystalline IC with high cohesive strength formed on the substrates. The synergistic effects between IC, polymer networks and substrates were investigated by solid state 1H NMR and molecular dynamics simulation. Such an adhesive layer is reversable and can be detached by heating and subsequent re&#8208;adhesion via cooling. This study proposed the new design of removable adhesives, which can be used in dynamic and complex environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Electron lever in Perovskite Nanocrystal to Regulate Local Electron Density for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Local electron density of atom is one key factor that determines its chemical properties. Regulating electron density can promote atom&#8217;s reactivity and so reduce reaction activation energy, which is highly desired in vast chemical applications. Herein, we report the intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy, which can regulate electron density of reaction centre atoms via manipulating ambient lattice states, for Fenton activity improvement. Typically, with the assistant of ultrasound, Mn4+&#8208;O&#8208;Fe3+  bond in BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3  perovskite nanocrystal can drive valence electrons and free electrons to accumulate on Fe atoms by polarization electric field originated from designed lattice strain. The increase of electron density significantly improves the catalytic activity of Fe, making the activation energy of BiFe0.97  Mn0.03O3  mediated Fenton reaction decrease by 52.55%, giving 9.21 times increase of &#8226;OH yield. This study provides a new view to understand the sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry, and the vast &#8226;OH production enables a highly effective CDT to tumor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework Exhibiting Band&#8208;like Transport with Ultra&#8208;High Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#960;&#8208;conjugated two dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively reported, developing fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COF is still an extremely difficult problem due to the lack of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D linkers. Here we synthesize a fully conjugated 3D COF (named as BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1) by designing a saddle&#8208;shaped building blocks of COThP&#8208;CHO. Attributing to the fully conjugated 3D network, the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 shows ultra&#8208;high Hall electron mobility up to ~3.0 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  at room temperature, one order of magnitude higher than the current &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D COFs. The temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity reveals that the charge carriers in BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibit the band&#8208;like transport mechanism, which is entirely different from the hopping transport phenomena observed in common organic materials. This work confirms that the fully conjugated 3D COFs could indeed achieve the electron delocalization and charge transport pathway within the whole 3D skeletons, which would open a new frontier for the organic semiconducting materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although &#960;&#8208;conjugated two dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively reported, developing fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COF is still an extremely difficult problem due to the lack of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D linkers. Here we synthesize a fully conjugated 3D COF (named as BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1) by designing a saddle&#8208;shaped building blocks of COThP&#8208;CHO. Attributing to the fully conjugated 3D network, the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 shows ultra&#8208;high Hall electron mobility up to ~3.0 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  at room temperature, one order of magnitude higher than the current &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D COFs.

         <dc:description>A catalytic atroposelective cycloaddition reaction between thioureas and ynals is developed. Our reaction features the first NHC&#8208;catalyzed addition of thioureas to acetylenic acylazolium intermediates to eventually set up C&#8208;N axial chirality with excellent optical purities. The axially chiral thiazine derivative products from our reactions bear multiple functional groups and show promising synthetic applications and antimicrobial activities against  Xanthomonas oryzae  pv  . oryzae  that causes rice bacterial blight.</dc:description>

         <title>An unexpected cubic symmetry in group IV alloys prepared using pressure and temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cubic diamond&#160; (Fd&#8208;3m) group IVA element Si has been the material driver of the electronics industry since its inception. We report synthesis of a new cubic (Im&#8208;3m) group IVA material, a GeSn solid solution, upon heating Ge and Sn at pressures from 13 to 28 GPa using double&#8208;sided diamond anvil laser&#8208;heating and large volume press methods. Both methods were coupled with  in&#8208;situ  angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction characterization. The new material substantially enriches the seminal group IVA alloy materials landscape by introducing an eightfold coordinated cubic symmetry, which markedly expands on the conventional tetrahedrally coordinated cubic one. This cubic solid solution is formed, despite Ge never adopting the Im&#8208;3m symmetry, melting inhibiting subsequent Im&#8208;3m formation and reactant Ge and Sn having unlike crystal structures and atomic radii at all these pressures. This is hence achieved without adherence to conventional formation criteria and routes to synthesis. This advance creates fertile avenues for new materials development.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;silica CHA Zeolite Membrane with Ultra&#8208;high Selectivity and Irradiation Stability for Krypton/Xenon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capture and storage of the long&#8208;lived 85Kr is an efficient approach to mitigate the emission of volatile radionuclides from the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. However, it is challenging to separate krypton (Kr) from xenon (Xe) because of the chemical inertness and similar physical properties. Herein we prepared high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes with ultra&#8208;high selectivity and irradiation stability for Kr/Xe separation. The suitable aperture size and rigid framework endures the membrane a strong size&#8208;exclusion effect. The ultrahigh selectivity of 51&#8208;152 together with the permeance of 0.7&#8208;1.3&#215;10&#8208;8 mol&#160;m&#8208;2&#160;s&#8208;1&#160;Pa&#8208;1 of high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes far surpass the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric membranes. The membrane is among the most stable polycrystalline membranes for separation of humid Kr/Xe mixtures. Together with the excellent irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes pave the way to separate radioactive Kr from Xe for a notable reduction of the volatile nuclear waste storage volume.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromoselective Photocatalysis Enables Stereocomplementary Biocatalytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the selectivity of a chemical reaction with external stimuli is common in thermal processes, but rare in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. Here we show that the redox potential of a carbon nitride photocatalyst (CN&#8208;OA&#8208;m) can be tuned by changing the irradiation wavelength to generate electron holes with different oxidation potentials. This tuning was the key to realizing photo&#8208;chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascades that give either the (  S  )&#8208; or the (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer of phenylethanol. In combination with an unspecific peroxygenase from  Agrocybe&#160;aegerita,  green light irradiation of CN&#8208;OA&#8208;m led to the enantioselective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to (  R  )&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (99%  e.e.  ). In contrast, blue light irradiation triggered the photocatalytic oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, which in turn was enantioselectively reduced with an alcohol dehydrogenase from  Rhodococcus&#160;ruber  to form (  S  )&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (93%  e.e  ).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/  N  &#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99%) and selectivity through a  one&#8208;pot  operation.

         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CORR and CO2RR) using copper catalysts and renewable electricity hold promise as a carbon&#8208;neutral route to produce commodity chemicals and fuels. However, the exact mechanisms and structure sensitivity of Cu electrodes toward C2 products are still under debate. Herein, we investigate ethylene oxide reduction (EOR) as a proxy to the late stages of CORR to ethylene, and the results are compared to those of acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol. DFT calculations show that ethylene oxide undergoes ring opening before exclusively reducing to ethylene via *OH formation. A selectivity map for the late stages of CORR and CO2RR based on generalized coordination numbers ( [[EQUATION]] ) shows that sites with moderate coordination (5.9 &lt;  [[EQUATION]] &lt; 7.5) are efficient for ethylene production, with pristine Cu(100) being more active than defective surfaces such as Cu(311). In contrast, kinks and edges are more active for ethanol production, and (111) terraces are relatively inert.</dc:description>

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Salinity Gradient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both high ionic conductivity and selectivity of a membrane are required for efficient salinity gradient energy conversion. An efficient method to improve energy conversion is to align ionic transport along the membrane thickness to address low ionic conductivity in traditional membranes used for energy harvesting. Here, we fabricate a free&#8208;standing covalent organic frameworks membrane (TpPa&#8208;SO  3  H) with excellent stability and mechanical properties. This membrane with one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels and high charge density demonstrates high ionic conductivity and selectivity. Its power density can reach up to 5.9 W/m  2&#160;  by mixing artificial seawater and river water. Based on our results, we propose that the high energy conversion is attributed to the high ion conductivity through aligned one&#8208;dimensional nanochannels and high ion selectivity via the size of the nanochannel at ~1 nm in the membrane. This study paves the way for designing covalent organic framework membranes for high salinity gradient energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Carbons: Half Covalent, Half Ionic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the first global minima containing a planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) atom are reported. The fifteen structures belong to the CE3M3+ (E = S&#8208;Te and M = Li&#8208;Cs) series and satisfy both geometric and electronic criteria to be considered as a true phC. The design strategy consisted of replacing oxygen in the D3h CO3Li3+ structure with heavy and less electronegative chalcogens, inducing a negative charge on the C atom and an attractive electrostatic interaction between C and the alkali cations. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali&#8208;metals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The successful integration or hybridization of perovskite oxides with their halide cousins can realize both multi&#8208;anionic and multi&#8208;cationic solid solutions with unique metal ion sites and synergistic properties, potentially surpassing the performance of the classic perovskites. However, such solid solutions have not been achieved due to their distinct formation energies and different synthesis conditions. The solid solutions combining perovskite oxides with fluorides were produced here by mechanochemical synthesis. The obtained perovskite oxide&#8208;halide solid solutions had highly mixed elements and valences, uniform element distributions, and single&#8208;phase crystalline structures. The solid solution with an optimized combination of oxides and fluorides exhibited enhanced catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatically&#8208;driven Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar physical properties and molecular dimensions. Adsorptive capture of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but rarely realized. Here, we report highly efficient electrostatically&#8208;driven CO  2  /C  2  H  2  separation in an ultramicroporous cadmium&#8208;nitroprusside (  Cd&#8208;NP  ) with compact pore space and complementary electrostatic potential well fitting for CO  2  , thus enabling molecular quadrupole moment recognition towards CO  2  over C  2  H  2  with significant sieving effect. This material shows high CO  2  /C  2  H  2  uptake ratio of 6.0 as well as remarkable CO  2  /C  2  H  2  selectivity of 85 under ambient condition with modest CO  2  adsorption heat, which is superior to most other CO  2  &#8208;selective absorbents. Neutron powder diffraction experiments and molecular simulations reveal that the electrostatic potential compatibility between pore structure and CO  2  allows it to be trapped in a head&#8208;on orientation towards the Cd center, whereas the diffusion of C  2  H  2  is electrostatically forbidden. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of this compound for CO  2  /C  2  H  2  separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing single&#8208;atom catalysts and catalytic reaction processes by shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing advanced characterization techniques for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is of great significance to identify their structural and catalytic properties. Raman spectroscopy can provide molecular structure information thus is a promising tool for catalysis, but its application in SACs remains a great challenge due to its low sensitivity. Herein, we develop a highly sensitive strategy that achieves the characterization of the structure of SACs and  in situ  monitoring of the catalytic reaction processes on them by shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) for the first time. Using such a strategy, Pd SACs on different supports are identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the nucleation process of Pd species from single atoms to nanoparticles has been revealed. Moreover, the catalytic reaction processes of the hydrogenation of nitrocompounds on Pd SACs are  in situ  monitored, and molecular insights are obtained to uncover the unique catalytic properties of SACs. This work provides a new spectroscopic tool for the  in situ  study of SACs, especially at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of structural defects in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), often achieved through the fractional use of defective linkers, is emerging as a means to refine the properties of existing MOFs. These linkers, missing coordination fragments, create unsaturated framework nodes that may alter the properties of the MOF. A property targeted utilization of this approach demands an understanding of the structure of the defect&#8208;engineered MOF. Here, we show that full&#8208;field X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure computed tomography can help to improve our understanding. This was demonstrated by visualizing the chemical heterogeneity found in defect&#8208;engineered HKUST&#8208;1 MOF crystals. Discovered was a non&#8208;uniform incorporation and zonation of the defective linker, leading to the presence of clusters of a second coordination polymer within HKUST&#8208;1. The former is suggested to be in part responsible for altered MOF properties, thereby advocating for a spatio&#8208;chemically resolved characterization of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Instability of the Superionic Halide Solid Electrolytes and the Implications for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic halide solid electrolytes show excellent cathodic electrolyte properties in solid state batteries, but they are unstable in contact with the lithium metal anode. The forming solid electrolyte interphase is analyzed herein, using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is analyzed to highlight the concept of hybrid electrolyte cells.







Abstract
Owing to high ionic conductivity and good oxidation stability, halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes regain interest for application in solid&#8208;state batteries. While stability at the cathode interface seems to be given, the stability against the lithium metal anode has not been explored yet. Herein, the formation of a reaction layer between Li3InCl6 (Li3YCl6) and lithium is studied by sputter deposition of lithium metal and subsequent in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by impedance spectroscopy. The interface is thermodynamically unstable and results in a continuously growing interphase resistance. Additionally, the interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is characterized by impedance spectroscopy to discern whether a combined use as cathode electrolyte and separator electrolyte, respectively, might enable long&#8208;term stable and low impedance operation. In fact, oxidation stable halide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors cannot be used against Li, but may be promising candidates as cathode electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Superionic halide solid electrolytes show excellent cathodic electrolyte properties in solid state batteries, but they are unstable in contact with the lithium metal anode. The forming solid electrolyte interphase is analyzed herein, using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;interface between Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl is analyzed to highlight the concept of hybrid electrolyte cells.

         <dc:description>
A Pd0&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective [3+2] spiroannulation reaction has been developed for rapid assembly of [5,5] spirocyclic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The regioselectivity could be dominated by fine&#8208;tuning the Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate. An array of coupling partners could be well&#8208;tolerated with excellent regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Potential application of the reaction was exemplified by several further transformations.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Photoactive Polymers on a Living Cell Surface via Bio&#8208;Palladium Catalysis for Modulating Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerization strategy to modify cell surface with conjugated polymers was developed by a bio&#8208;Pd nanoparticle catalyst on a cell surface. Polyphenyleneethynylene formed in&#8197;situ traces the polymerization process, exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli, and augments the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa.







Abstract
Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. Here, a bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy was developed for in&#8197;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8197;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. It can also augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. With this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be synthesized in&#8197;situ on the living cell surface.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Bond Zincation of Arenes: Scope, Mechanism, and the Role of Heterometallic Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;Zn bonds. The reaction scope includes fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene. Heterometallic Pd&#8211;Zn complexes play a key role in the catalysis.







Abstract
Catalytic methods that transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X=B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X=Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C&#8722;H bonds remains unknown. Herein, we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;Zn bonds. The new catalytic C&#8722;H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes&#8212;including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene&#8212;with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd&#8211;Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C&#8722;H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps of C&#8722;H functionalisation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric double layer is formed prior to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on reactive metal electrodes. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013271), Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers identify the critical role of the electric double layer chemistry and structure in governing the competitive reactions during SEI formation. The results provide guidance for targeted interface design to generate a stable working lithium anode interface.

         <title>Alkyne 1,1&#8208;Hydroboration to a Reactive Frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P/B&#8208;H frustrated Lewis pair is formed by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. It reacts in an unusual way with a variety of organic &#960;&#8208;systems by addition/rearrangement routes.







Abstract
The Mes2P&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;SiMe3 alkyne reacts with the borane H2B&#8208;Fmes by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction to give an unsaturated C2&#8208;bridged frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis pair. Most of its reactions are determined by the presence of the B&#8208;H functionality at the FLP function and the activated connecting carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. It reduces carbon monoxide to the formyl stage. With nitriles it reacts in an extraordinary way: it undergoes a reaction sequence that eventually results in the formation of a P&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborole derivative. Several similar examples were found. In one case a P&#8208;ylide was isolated that was related to an intermediate of the reaction sequence. It subsequently opened in an alternative way to give an alkenyl borane product.

         <title>Characterization of a Molecule Partially Confined at the Pore Mouth of a Zeotype</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the interaction of a molecule with a pore mouth &#8211; a critical step in adsorption processes &#8211; by characterizing the conformation of a macrocyclic calix[4]arene&#8208;TiIV complex, which is grafted on the external surface of a zeotype (*&#8208;SVY). X&#8208;ray absorption and 13C{1H} CPMAS NMR spectroscopies independently detect a unique conformation of this complex when it is grafted at crystallographically equivalent locations that lie at the interface of 7 &#197; hemispherical microporous cavities and the external surface. Electronic structure calculations support the presence of this unique conformation, and suggest that it is brought about by a specific orientation of the macrocycle that maximizes non&#8208;covalent interactions between calix[4]arene upper&#8208;rim tert&#8208;butyl substituents and the microporous&#8208;cavity walls. Our comparative study provides a rare &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of a molecule partially confined at a pore mouth, an essential intermediate for adsorption into micropores, and demonstrates how surrounding environment controls this confinement in a sensitive fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution with Unstabilized Benzyl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2987-2992, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of benzylzinc reagents were employed as nucleophiles in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed substitution of acyclic fluorinated allylic carbonates under mild conditions. The method enables direct installation of a privileged ternary benzyl scaffold, which is a ubiquitous motif in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We have developed a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of challenging alkyl&#8208;substituted secondary allylic carbonates with benzylzinc reagents, which are prepared from widely available benzyl halides. This process utilizes rhodium(III) chloride as a commercially available, high&#8208;oxidation state and bench&#8208;stable pre&#8208;catalyst to provide a rare example of a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective allylic substitution in the absence of an exogenous ligand. This reaction tolerates electronically diverse benzylzinc nucleophiles and an array of functionalized and/or challenging aliphatic allylic electrophiles. Finally, the configurational fluxionality of the rhodium&#8208;allyl intermediate is exploited to develop a novel diastereoselective process for the construction of vicinal acyclic ternary/ternary stereogenic centers, in addition to a cyclic ternary/quaternary derivative.

         <title>RNA&#8208;PROTACs: Degraders of RNA&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3163-3169, February 8, 2021. </description>

RNA&#8208;PROTACs are new chimeric structures that mediate the proteasomal degradation of RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBP). They comprise an E3&#8208;recruiting peptide conjugated to a short modified RNA, which is iso&#8208;sequential with the native binding element to which the RBP binds in cells. RNA&#8208;PROTACs offer a fast, rational and general approach to target an entire class of protein (RBPs) that has proven difficult until today to target pharmacologically.







Abstract
Defects in the functions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are at the origin of many diseases; however, targeting RBPs with conventional drugs has proven difficult. PROTACs are a new class of drugs that mediate selective degradation of a target protein through a cell's ubiquitination machinery. PROTACs comprise a moiety that binds the selected protein, conjugated to a ligand of an E3 ligase. Herein, we introduce RNA&#8208;PROTACs as a new concept in the targeting of RBPs. These chimeric structures employ small RNA mimics as targeting groups that dock the RNA&#8208;binding site of the RBP, whereupon a conjugated E3&#8208;recruiting peptide derived from the HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein directs the RBP for proteasomal degradation. We performed a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration with the degradation of two RBPs&#8212;a stem cell factor LIN28 and a splicing factor RBFOX1&#8212;and showed their use in cancer cell lines. The RNA&#8208;PROTAC approach opens the way to rapid, selective targeting of RBPs in a rational and general fashion.

         <title>Insertion of Metal&#8208;Substituted Silylene into Naphthalene's Aromatic Ring and Subsequent Rearrangement for Silaspiro&#8208;Benzocycloheptenyl and Cyclobutenosilaindan Derivatives</title>

With naphthalene and (Me3Si)3CSiCl3 as the starting materials, silacyclopropanyl complexes of potassium and divalent ytterbium are synthesized, which can readily convert into silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl and cyclobutenosilaindan derivatives, showing the first example of insertion of a metal&#8208;substituted silylene fragment into naphthalene's aromatic ring and rearrangements into the structurally intriguing silacycles.







Abstract
Synthesis of silacycle compounds are of fundamental and application importance. Herein we report the first example of insertion of metal&#8208;substituted silylene fragment into naphthalene's aromatic ring. More significantly, this insertion is followed by interesting rearrangements to yield silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl and cyclobutenosilaindan derivatives. The formation of cyclobutenosilaindan derivative includes the C&#8722;C bond cleavage and 4&#960; electrocyclization steps; the formation of silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl derivative is more complicated, including the C&#8722;C bond cleavage, reversible 4&#960; electrocyclization, C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;Si bond cleavage. DFT investigations were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic aspects of these two rearrangements. The formed cyclobutenosilaindan potassium can readily react with PhOH, MeOTf, EtOTf, PhCH2Cl or PhCOCl at room temperature to afford the hydrogen, alkyl, benzyl or benzoyl substituted cyclobutenosilaindans in high yields.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthetic Investigation of a New Antibacterial Dehydrated Non&#8208;Ribosomal Tripeptide</title>

Albopeptide, a new antibacterial short peptidyl metabolite, was found to contain a unique contiguous Dha&#8208;(E)&#8208;Dhb moiety. In&#8208;vitro reconstitution and biochemical analysis together with chemical capture of online biosynthetic intermediates demonstrated that two condensation domains in the corresponding NRPSs catalyse the dehydration reactions on the Ser and Thr residues, respectively, to generate Dha and (E)&#8208;Dhb residues.







Abstract
Dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) display considerable flexibility in a variety of chemical and biological reactions. Natural products containing Dha and/or Dhb residues are often found to display diverse biological activities. While the (Z) geometry is predominant in nature, only a handful of metabolites containing (E)&#8208;Dhb have been found thus far. Here we report discovery of a new antimicrobial peptide, albopeptide, through NMR analysis and chemical synthesis, which contains two contiguous unsaturated residues, Dha&#8208;(E)&#8208;Dhb. It displays narrow&#8208;spectrum activity against vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus&#8197;faecium. In&#8208;vitro biochemical assays show that albopeptide originates from a noncanonical NRPS pathway featuring dehydration processes and catalysed by unusual condensation domains. Finally, we provide evidence of the occurrence of a previously untapped group of short unsaturated peptides in the bacterial kingdom, suggesting an important biological function in bacteria.

A series of amide&#8208;cyclodextrin derivatives possessing multiple 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl (bpy) groups forms mononuclear complexes whose specific three bpy groups are linked in the fac&#8208;&#923; configuration. The intermolecular coordination of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal complex exclusively produces a dissymmetric cyclodextrin trimer as a single isomer. Chiral recognition of amino acid anions is realized utilizing the distinctive amide groups arranged on the unsymmetrically fixed scaffold.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up chemical synthesis to construct intricate molecules has been a profound challenge. An effective approach is to utilize organic ligands and metal ions, but the formation of a single product among other possible candidates has proven difficult for dissymmetric structures. We now report the synthesis of single isomeric complexes with dissymmetric structures using the mismatch in the coordination valences of macrocyclic homooligomers and metal ions. A series of amide&#8208;cyclodextrin derivatives possessing multiple 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl (bpy) groups forms mononuclear complexes whose specific three bpy groups are linked in the fac&#8208;&#923; configuration. The intermolecular coordination of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal complex produces a dissymmetric cyclodextrin trimer as a single isomer, whose initially equivalent 21 (=7&#215;3) bipyridylamide&#8208;pyranose units are placed in different environments. Furthermore, we realize chiral recognition of amino acid anions utilizing the distinctive amide groups arranged on the unsymmetrically fixed scaffold.

         <title>Tandem Mn&#8211;I Exchange and Homocoupling Processes Mediated by a Synergistically Operative Lithium Manganate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3247-3253, February 8, 2021. </description>

By exploiting chemical cooperativity between Li and MnII, a series of symmetrical bis(aryls) has been prepared by a stepwise direct Mn&#8211;I exchange/oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling protocol. Trapping and characterization of key reaction intermediates demonstrates the involvement of lithium manganate species in which Li and Mn work together to facilitate these transformations.







Abstract
Pairing lithium and manganese(II) to form lithium manganate [Li2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] enables the efficient direct Mn&#8211;I exchange of aryliodides, affording transient (aryl)lithium manganate intermediates which in turn undergo spontaneous C&#8722;C homocoupling at room temperature to furnish symmetrical (bis)aryls in good yields under mild reaction conditions. The combination of EPR with X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies has revealed the mixed Li/Mn constitution of the organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions, including the homocoupling step which had previously been thought to occur via a single&#8208;metal Mn aryl species. These studies show Li and Mn working together in a synergistic manner to facilitate both the Mn&#8211;I exchange and the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming steps. Both steps are carefully synchronized, with the concomitant generation of the alkyliodide ICH2SiMe3 during the Mn&#8211;I exchange being essential to the aryl homocoupling process, wherein it serves as an in situ generated oxidant.

         <title>Protofibril&#8211;Fibril Interactions Inhibit Amyloid Fibril Assembly by Obstructing Secondary Nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3016-3021, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid fibrils preferentially originate from the surface of existing fibrils, as the fibril surface catalyzes the conversion of monomeric precursors in a process called secondary nucleation. Metastable protofibrils, an alternative, particularly toxic, assembly type of amyloid proteins, bind amyloid fibril surfaces and obstruct secondary nucleation. Protofibrils thereby delay their own replacement by amyloid fibrils.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) assemble into both rigid amyloid fibrils and metastable oligomers termed A&#946;O or protofibrils. In Alzheimer's disease, A&#946; fibrils constitute the core of senile plaques, but A&#946; protofibrils may represent the main toxic species. A&#946; protofibrils accumulate at the exterior of senile plaques, yet the protofibril&#8211;fibril interplay is not well understood. Applying chemical kinetics and atomic force microscopy to the assembly of A&#946; and lysozyme, protofibrils are observed to bind to the lateral surfaces of amyloid fibrils. When utilizing A&#946; variants with different critical oligomer concentrations, the interaction inhibits the autocatalytic proliferation of amyloid fibrils by secondary nucleation on the fibril surface. Thus, metastable oligomers antagonize their replacement by amyloid fibrils both by competing for monomers and blocking secondary nucleation sites. The protofibril&#8212;fibril interaction governs their temporal evolution and potential to exert specific toxic activities.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Quantitative Imaging of Native Microbiota Distribution in the Gut</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3055-3061, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating a fluorescent D&#8208;amino acid labeling strategy for gut microbiota and hydrophilic tissue&#8208;clearing, we achieved quantitative 3D imaging of the indigenous mouse gut microbiota in their native context with high spatial resolution and imaging depth. Bacteria were unexpectedly found in the small intestine crypts, a region that was previously considered to be bacteria&#8208;free.







Abstract
Owing to the challenges to acquire detailed spatial information of gut bacteria in&#8197;situ, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microbiota distributions in the gut remain largely uncharted. Here, we propose a tissue clearing&#8208;based and D&#8208;amino acid labeling&#8208;facilitated (TiDaL) strategy that combines a novel microbiota in&#8197;vivo labeling protocol, CUBIC&#8208;based tissue clearing and whole&#8208;mount tissue imaging, to achieve 3D imaging of indigenous gut microbiota. We demonstrate high&#8208;resolution 3D acquisition of their biogeography in different gut sections, and present quantitative spatial details in relation to the host epithelium. We unexpectedly observe microbiota in the small intestine crypts, which were thought to be bacteria&#8208;free. Significant bacterial overgrowth in the first two&#8208;thirds of the small intestine is detected in an enteritis model. We expect that this quantitative 3D imaging strategy for native gut microbiota will provide insightful information into the host&#8211;microbiota interactions.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Lipid Conjugate for Rapid Labeling of Neutrophils and Monitoring of Their Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3175-3181, February 8, 2021. </description>

An AIE&#8208;Lipid conjugate was designed to offer ultrafast, wash&#8208;free and biocompatible labeling of neutrophils for their in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo behavior monitoring.







Abstract
Studies on neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutic engineering have shown great potentials in treating infection and inflammation disorders. Conventional neutrophil labeling methods are time&#8208;consuming and often result in undesired contamination and activation since neutrophils are terminal&#8208;differentiated cells with a half&#8208;life span of only 7&#8197;h. A simple, fast, and biocompatible strategy to construct engineered neutrophils is highly desirable but remains difficult to achieve. In this study, we present an AIEgen&#8208;lipid conjugate, which can efficiently label harvested neutrophils in 30&#8197;s with no washing step required. This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.

This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bifunctional Effects of Cation Additive on Na&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3205-3211, February 8, 2021. </description>

A cation additive of TBA+ shows bifunctional effect of both dendrite suppression and superoxide stabilization in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The Na deposition regulation induced by prior adsorption of TBA+ at the anode and superoxide disproportionation mitigation originated from soft Lewis acid coordination at the cathode promote the cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency of the Na&#8208;O2 battery.







Abstract
Aprotic Na&#8208;O2 batteries have attracted growing interest owing to their low overpotentials and high energy density. Their cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency are limited, however, by Na dendrite formation and superoxide (O2&#8722;) degradation. Here, we present a bifunctional cation additive, the tetrabutylammonium cation (TBA+), to simultaneously protect the Na anode and stabilize the superoxide. The adsorption of TBA+ on the Na anode suppresses the dendrite formation in the Na plating and ensures stable anode cycling at high current density in both Ar and oxygen atmospheres. Aprotic Na&#8208;O2 batteries with TBA+ show increased Coulombic efficiency as well as good rate capability. These are rewarded by the fast desolvation kinetics of O2&#8722; and suppression of the disproportionation reaction of O2&#8722; with TBA+, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation and DFT calculations. This bifunctional effect of this cation additive paves a new avenue for the development of Na&#8208;O2 batteries.

A simple, economic, and environmentally friendly strategy is developed to fabricate paper electrochemical devices (PEDs) with three&#8208;electrode systems that can be readily modified with aptamers to achieve a sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. Aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs serve as a general sensing platform for the point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection of analytes like biomolecules and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. Paper&#8208;based E&#8208;AB sensors could enable portable, low&#8208;cost, and rapid detection of a broad range of targets, but it has proven challenging to fabricate suitable three&#8208;electrode systems on paper. Here, we demonstrate a simple, economic, and environmentally friendly strategy for fabricating aptamer&#8208;modified paper electrochemical devices (PEDs) via ambient vacuum filtration. The material, shape, size, and thickness of the three&#8208;electrode PED system can be fully customized. We developed aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. The sensitivity and stability of the PEDs are comparable to E&#8208;AB sensors based on commercial gold electrodes. We believe our strategy can lead to the development of high performance PEDs for the on&#8208;site detection of a variety of analytes.

A graphdiyne heterojunction photocatalyst for ammonia synthesis reaches reaction rates of 1762.35&#177;153.71 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 (the highest Y
 could reach up to 1916.06 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1). Our results demonstrated that the excellent properties originated from graphdiyne incorporating Fe site&#8208;specific magnetite, resulting in a valence state transition in the catalytic process.







Abstract
A highly active graphdiyne heterojunction with highly efficient photocatalysis is designed and fabricated. This catalyst demonstrates transformative properties on photocatalysis for ammonia synthesis. Such excellent properties are reigned from graphdiyne incorporating Fe site&#8208;specific magnetite resulting in a valence state transition within the catalyst. Our results show the strong advantages of graphdiyne in effectively regulating magnetite activity and coordination environments and also indicate that magnetite can selectively form two different valence tetrahedral coordination Fe and octahedral coordination Fe. The catalysts show remarkable catalytic performance for ammonia synthesis by photocatalysis, indicating transformative photocatalytic activity with an ammonia yield (Y
) of unprecedented level of 1762.35&#177;153.71&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 (the highest Y
 could reach up to 1916.06&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1). This work makes full use of the structural and property features of graphdiyne and opens up a new direction for photocatalysis in the field of catalysis.

         <title>Arrested Substrate Binding Resolves Catalytic Intermediates in Higher&#8208;Plant Water Oxidation</title>

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that the final metastable catalytic state (S3) in biological water oxidation in higher plants is a mixture of a high&#8208;spin and an intermediate&#8208;spin form. These two forms represent distinct structural components related to water binding and activation on the path towards oxygen evolution.







Abstract
Among the intermediate catalytic steps of the water&#8208;oxidizing Mn4CaO5 cluster of photosystem&#8197;II (PSII), the final metastable S3 state is critically important because it binds one substrate and precedes O2 evolution. Herein, we combine X&#8208; and Q&#8208;band EPR experiments on native and methanol&#8208;treated PSII of Spinacia oleracea and show that methanol&#8208;treated PSII preparations of the S3 state correspond to a previously uncharacterized high&#8208;spin (S=6) species. This is confirmed as a major component also in intact photosynthetic membranes, coexisting with the previously known intermediate&#8208;spin conformation (S=3). The high&#8208;spin intermediate is assigned to a water&#8208;unbound form, with a MnIV3 subunit interacting ferromagnetically via anisotropic exchange with a coordinatively unsaturated MnIV ion. These results resolve and define the structural heterogeneity of the S3 state, providing constraints on the S3 to S4 transition, on substrate identity and delivery pathways, and on the mechanism of O&#8722;O bond formation.

Dynamic evolution of active sites and key oxygen intermediate products during the ORR and OER on N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts are monitored experimentally with in situ ATR&#8208;IR spectra. With the assistance of isotopic labeling, the formation of *OOH species from O2&#8722;* (O2&#8722;*+H2O&#8594;OOH*+OH&#8722;) is suggested to be a possible RDS during the ORR process, whereas the generation of O2 from OOH* species is the most possible RDS during the OER process.







Abstract
The recent mechanistic understanding of active sites, adsorbed intermediate products, and rate&#8208;determining steps (RDS) of nitrogen&#8197;(N)&#8208;modified carbon catalysts in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are still rife with controversy because of the inevitable coexistence of diverse N configurations and the technical limitations for the observation of formed intermediates. Herein, seven kinds of aromatic molecules with designated single N species are used as model structures to investigate the explicit role of each common N group in both ORR and OER. Specifically, dynamic evolution of active sites and key adsorbed intermediate products including O2 (ads), superoxide anion O2&#8722;*, and OOH* are monitored with in&#8197;situ spectroscopy. We propose that the formation of *OOH species from O2&#8722;* (O2&#8722;*+H2O&#8594;OOH*+OH&#8722;) is a possible RDS during the ORR process, whereas the generation of O2 from OOH* species is the most likely RDS during the OER process.

         <title>Structural Basis of the Modulation of the Voltage&#8208;Gated Calcium Ion Channel Cav1.1 by Dihydropyridine Compounds**

High&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of nanodisc&#8208;embedded Cav1.1 in complex with antagonists Levamlodipine, (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;Bay K8644, and dual agonist/antagonist (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Bay K8644 reveal the molecular basis of the allosteric modulation of the voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ channel Cav1.1 by dihydropyridine (DHP) drugs. Advanced structural understanding of the stereo&#8208;selective mode of action of DHP will facilitate drug discovery targeting Cav channels.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines (DHP), the most commonly used antihypertensives, function by inhibiting the L&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels. DHP compounds exhibit chirality&#8208;specific antagonistic or agonistic effects. The structure of rabbit Cav1.1 bound to an achiral drug nifedipine reveals the general binding mode for DHP drugs, but the molecular basis for chiral specificity remained elusive. Herein, we report five cryo&#8208;EM structures of nanodisc&#8208;embedded Cav1.1 in the presence of the bestselling drug amlodipine, a DHP antagonist (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;Bay K8644, and a titration of its agonistic enantiomer (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Bay K8644 at resolutions of 2.9&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#197;. The amlodipine&#8208;bound structure reveals the molecular basis for the high efficacy of the drug. All structures with the addition of the Bay K8644 enantiomers exhibit similar inactivated conformations, suggesting that (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Bay K8644, when acting as an agonist, is insufficient to lock the activated state of the channel for a prolonged duration.

         <title>17.1&#8201;%&#8208;Efficient Eco&#8208;Compatible Organic Solar Cells from a Dissymmetric 3D Network Acceptor</title>

A dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups give a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17&#8201;% which is the highest among polymer solar cells processed by halogen&#8208;free solvents. Dissymmetric chlorination and trifluoromethylation is a practical approach towards a low band&#8208;gap acceptor for eco&#8208;compatible processed photovoltaic applications.







Abstract
To elevate the performance of polymer solar cells (PSC) processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents, a dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups has been designed and synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data suggests that BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 has a 3D network packing structure as a result of H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregations between adjacent molecules, which will strengthen its charge transport as an acceptor material. When PBDB&#8208;TF was used as a donor, the toluene&#8208;processed binary device realized a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.31&#8201;%, which improved to 17.12&#8201;% when PC71ThBM was added as the third component. Its efficiency of over 17&#8201;% is currently the highest among polymer solar cells processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Compared to its symmetric counterparts BTIC&#8208;4Cl and BTIC&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#947;, the dissymmetric BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 integrates their merits, and has optimized the molecular aggregations with excellent storage and photo&#8208;stability, and also extending the maximum absorption peak in film to 852&#8197;nm. The devices exhibit good transparency indicating a potential utilization in semi&#8208;transparent building integrated photovoltaics (ST&#8208;BIPV).

         <title>Exploiting Ru&#8208;Induced Lattice Strain in CoRu Nanoalloys for Robust Bifunctional Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3290-3298, February 8, 2021. </description>

Ultra&#8208;low Ru induced CoRu nanoalloy lattice strain for robust hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) bifunctional hydrogen production is introduced. The CoRu0.5/CQDs displayed excellent stability during each reaction, including seven alternating cycles of HER and AB hydrolysis.







Abstract
Designing bifunctional catalysts capable of driving the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and also H2 evolution via the hydrolysis of hydrogen storage materials such as ammonia borane (AB) is of considerable practical importance for future hydrogen economies. Herein, we systematically examined the effect of tensile lattice strain in CoRu nanoalloys supported on carbon quantum dots (CoRu/CQDs) on hydrogen generation by HER and AB hydrolysis. By varying the Ru content, the lattice parameters and Ru&#8208;induced lattice strain in the CoRu nanoalloys could be tuned. The CoRu0.5/CQDs catalyst with an ultra&#8208;low Ru content (1.33 wt.%) exhibited excellent catalytic activity for HER (&#951;=18&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH) and extraordinary activity for the hydrolysis of AB with a turnover frequency of 3255.4&#8197;mol
&#8201;mol&#8722;1(Ru)&#8201;min&#8722;1 or 814.7&#8197;mol
&#8201;mol&#8722;1(cat)&#8201;min&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, respectively, representing one of the best activities yet reported for AB hydrolysis over a ruthenium alloy catalyst. Moreover, the CoRu0.5/CQDs catalyst displayed excellent stability during each reaction, including seven alternating cycles of HER and AB hydrolysis. Theoretical calculations revealed that the remarkable catalytic performance of CoRu0.5/CQDs resulted from the optimal alloy electronic structure realized by incorporating small amounts of Ru, which enabled fast interfacial electron transfer to intermediates, thus benefitting H2 evolution kinetics. Results support the development of new and improved catalysts HER and AB hydrolysis.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Aziridines Enabled by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene/Copper Cooperative Catalysis: Carbene Dose&#8208;Controlled Chemo&#8208;Switchability</title>

Highly efficient kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of racemic N&#8208;tosylaziridines with isatin&#8208;derived enals have been achieved by the cooperative catalysis of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and copper complexes, leading to highly enantioenriched N&#8208;tosylaziridines and spirooxindole derivatives with high structural diversity.







Abstract
Catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) are alternative and complementary avenues to access chiral stereoisomers of both starting materials and reaction products. The development of highly efficient chiral catalytic systems for kinetically controlled processes has therefore been one of the linchpins in asymmetric synthesis. N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/copper cooperative catalysis has enabled highly efficient KR and DyKAT of racemic N&#8208;tosylaziridines by [3+3] annulation with isatin&#8208;derived enals, leading to highly enantioenriched N&#8208;tosylaziridine derivatives (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) and a large library of spirooxindole derivatives with high structural diversity and stereoselectivity (up to &gt;95:5 d.r., &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that the NHC can bind reversibly to the copper catalyst without compromising its catalytic activity and regulate the catalytic activity of the copper complex to switch the chemoselection between KR and DyKAT.

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Iduronic Acid&#8208;Containing Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans by a Polynuclear Platinum Compound and Implications for Development of Antimetastatic Platinum Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3283-3289, February 8, 2021. </description>

A novel approach for the design of platinum complexes with intrinsic anti&#8208;metastatic potential is presented. Metalloshielding of a model heparan sulfate (HS) pentasaccharide by the highly cationic TriPlatinNC modifies the conformational preference of the critical iduronic acid residue. Structural modulation of HS can result in inhibition of cellular cleavage by hepara(i)nase with a consequence in tumour cells being prevention of metastases.







Abstract
1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies on the 1:1 adduct of the pentasaccharide Fondaparinux (FPX) and the substitution&#8208;inert polynuclear platinum complex TriplatinNC show significant modulation of geometry around the glycosidic linkages of the FPX constituent monosaccharides. FPX is a valid model for the highly sulfated cell signalling molecule heparan sulfate (HS). The conformational ratio of the 1C4:2S0 forms of the FPX residue IdoA(2S) is altered from ca. 35:65 (free FPX) to ca. 75:25 in the adduct; the first demonstration of a small molecule affecting conformational changes on a HS oligosaccharide. Functional consequences of such binding are suggested to be inhibition of HS cleavage in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We further describe inhibition of metastasis by TriplatinNC in the TNBC 4T1 syngeneic tumour model. Our work provides insight into a novel approach for design of platinum drugs (and coordination compounds in general) with intrinsic anti&#8208;metastatic potential.

         <title>Elucidation of the Chemical Role of the Pyroclastic Materials on the State of Conservation of Mural Paintings from Pompeii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3028-3036, February 8, 2021. </description>

Pyroclastic materials buried and protected ancient Pompeii throughout the centuries. In this work, we demonstrate that they could represent a threat for the conservation state of the mural paintings, since rainwater and groundwater cause the leaching and transfer of ions to the mural paintings, promoting salt crystallisation. At Pompeii, the latter is one of the main causes of the detachment of the pictorial layers.







Abstract
Pyroclastic strata have always been thought to protect the archaeological remains of the Vesuvian area (Italy), hence allowing their conservation throughout the centuries. In this work, we demonstrate that they constitute a potential threat for the conservation state of the mural paintings of Pompeii. The ions that could be leached from them and the ion&#8208;rich groundwater coming from the volcanic soil/rocks may contribute to salt crystallisation. Thermodynamic modelling not only allowed to predict which salts can precipitate from such leaching events but also assisted the identification of additional sources of sulfates and alkali metals to explain the formation of the sulfates identified in efflorescences from the mural paintings of Pompeii. For the future, fluorine, mainly related to a volcanic origin, can be proposed as a marker to monitor the extent of the impact in the mural paintings of Pompeii in&#8197;situ.

Color&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) alloy assemblies have been rationally modulated by tailoring the stoichiometric ratio of Pe and DCA as a consequence of energy transfer from Pe or DCA to Pe&#8208;DCA complex. These alloy assemblies emerge as promising waveguiding media: controllable optical loss in 1D (DCA)1&#8722;x(Pe)x microribbons and successive waveguide conversion from isotropy to anisotropy in 2D (Pe)1&#8722;y(DCA)y nanosheets.







Abstract
An electron donor/acceptor pair comprising perylene (Pe) and 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene (DCA) was specifically designed to construct organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) alloys via weak CT interaction through a solution co&#8208;assembly route. By adjusting the molar ratio between Pe and DCA, we achieve color&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable CT alloy assemblies involving one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DCA)1&#8722;x(Pe)x (0 &#8804; x &#8804;10&#8201;%) microribbons and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) (Pe)1&#8722;y(DCA)y (0 &#8804; y &#8804;5&#8201;%) nanosheets as a consequence of energy transfer from DCA or &#945;&#8208;Pe to Pe&#8208;DCA CT complex. Importantly, dimension&#8208;related optical waveguiding performances are also revealed: continuously adjustable optical loss in 1D (DCA)1&#8722;x(Pe)x microribbons and successive conversion from isotropic waveguide to anisotropic waveguide in 2D (Pe)1&#8722;y(DCA)y nanosheets. The present work provides a desired platform for in&#8208;depth investigation of light&#8208;harvesting organic CT alloy assemblies, which show promising applications in miniaturized optoelectronic devices.

This work reports a strategy of substituting the anodic oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically flexible and kinetically favorable oxidation reactions for the efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2. The same product, formic acid, can be obtained with a low cell voltage from both the anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction catalyzed by CuONS/CF and the cathodic CO2 reduction reaction catalyzed by mSnO2/CC.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into energy&#8208;carrying compounds or value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect and the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;dioxide emissions, but it suffers from the kinetically sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its less value&#8208;added production of O2. We report a general strategy for efficient formic&#8208;acid synthesis by a concurrent cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic partial methanol&#8208;oxidation reaction (MOR) using mesoporous SnO2 grown on carbon cloth (mSnO2/CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47&#8197;V vs. RHE (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), featuring a significantly enhanced electro&#8208;activity in comparison to the OER. The cathodic mSnO2/CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81&#8201;% at 0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE for formic&#8208;acid production from CO2. The established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO2/CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formic&#8208;acid production at both sides.

         <title>An Ethacrynic Acid&#8208;Brominated BODIPY Photosensitizer (EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>

A molecular construct (EA&#8208;BPS) that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor is shown to overcome hypoxia&#8208;mediated resistance in pre&#8208;clinical PDT therapy models.







Abstract
Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension. Glutathione&#8208;pi (GST&#8208;pi) is a key enzyme that militates against ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis. We report herein a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We conclude that by making better use of the available oxygen in tumor environments, improved therapeutic PDT outcomes should be achievable even under hypoxic conditions.

         <title>Liquid Nanoparticles: Manipulating the Nucleation and Growth of Nanoscale Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3047-3054, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of liquid droplet like nanoparticles: To mimic the classic synthetic methods of nanoparticles, a bottom&#8208;up approach for the fabrication of nanoscale droplets has been developed. Synthetic techniques for solid nanoparticles, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth and co&#8208;precipitation, have been transferred to liquid droplets. This leads to the facile fabrication of multishell hollow structures, nanoreactors and carriers.







Abstract
By manipulating the nucleation and growth of solid materials, the synthesis of various sophisticated nanostructures has been achieved. Similar methodology, if applied to liquids, could enable the mass&#8208;production and control of ultra&#8208;small droplets at the scale of nanoparticles (10&#8722;18&#8197;L or below). It would be highly desirable since droplets play a fundamental role in numerous applications. Here we present a general strategy to synthesize and manipulate nanoscale droplets, similar to what has been done to solid nanoparticles in classic solution&#8208;synthesis. It was achieved by a solute&#8208;induced phase separation which initiates the nucleation of droplets from a homogeneous solution. These liquid nanoparticles have great potentials to be manipulated like their solid counterparts, borrowing from the vast methodologies of nanoparticle synthesis, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth, and co&#8208;precipitation. Liquid nanoparticles also serve as a general synthetic platform, to fabricate nanoreactors, drug&#8208;loaded carriers, and other hollow nanostructures with a variety of shell materials.

The [4+2] annulation of hydroxamic acids with olefins affords a benzo[c][1,2]oxazine scaffold via anode&#8208;selective electrochemical oxidation. Dioxygenation of olefins employing hydroxamic acid is also achieved simply by switching the anode material under the same reaction conditions.







Abstract
This work represents the first [4+2] annulation of hydroxamic acids with olefins for the synthesis of benzo[c][1,2]oxazines scaffold via anode&#8208;selective electrochemical oxidation. This protocol features mild conditions, is oxidant free, shows high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope of both alkenes and hydroxamic acids, and is compatible with terpenes, peptides, and steroids. Significantly, the dioxygenation of olefins employing hydroxamic acid is also successfully achieved by switching the anode material under the same reaction conditions. The study not only reveals a new reactivity of hydroxamic acids and its first application in electrosynthesis but also provides a successful example of anode material&#8208;tuned product selectivity.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Electrokinetic Evidence for a Bifunctional Mechanism of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3095-3103, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), was conducted. FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8722;O bond forming step is the OH&#8722; attack on an Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a NiIII&#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive PCET steps.







Abstract
A bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism, in which the energetically demanding step of the attack of hydroxide on a metal oxo unit is facilitated by a hydrogen atom transfer to a second site, has the potential to circumvent the scaling relationship. However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8722;O bond forming step is the OH&#8722; attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a NiIII&#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.

         <title>A Cerium Vanadate Nanozyme with Specific Superoxide Dismutase Activity Regulates Mitochondrial Function and ATP Synthesis in Neuronal Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3121-3130, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a nanozyme that can fully substitute the function of SOD1 and SOD2 in neuronal cells and regulate the synthesis of ATP under oxidative stress conditions is described. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial dysfunction and improves the levels of pro&#8208;survival Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins.







Abstract
Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal&#8208;containing enzymes (metallo&#8208;nanozymes) are of therapeutic importance for treating various diseases. However, it is still not clear whether such nanozymes can completely substitute the function of natural enzymes in living cells. In this work, we show for the first time that a cerium vanadate (CeVO4) nanozyme can substitute the function of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) in the neuronal cells even when the natural enzyme is down&#8208;regulated by specific gene silencing. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1&#8208; and SOD2&#8208;depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. Furthermore, the nanozyme effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative stress.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Chiral Superstructures in Self&#8208;Assembled Anthracene&#8208;Terminal Amino Acids with Predictable and Adjustable Chiroptical Activities and Color Evolution</title>

The universal existence of supramolecular tilt helical superstructures in self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acid derivatives, which crucially correlates to their chiroptical properties is unveiled. 







Abstract
Deep understanding of structure&#8211;property relationship between packing of chiral building units and their chiroptical behaviors would significantly facilitate the rational design and fabrication of the emerging chiroptical materials such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissive materials. In this paper, we unveil the universal existence of supramolecular tilt helical superstructures in self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acid derivatives. A series of coded amino acid methyl esters were conjugated to anthracene segments at N&#8208;terminus, which afforded 21 and 31 symmetry supramolecular tilt chirality in solid&#8208;states. Helical assemblies enabled diversified Cotton effects and CPL performances, which were in accordance with the tilted chirality between anthracene segments. Such correlation shows fine universality, whereby the chiroptical prediction could be realized. Furthermore, on top of charge&#8208;transfer complexation, manipulation of CPL emission colors and handedness were realized.

         <title>Ultrathin Single Crystalline MgO(111) Nanosheets**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3254-3260, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin single crystalline MgO nanosheets that are preferentially oriented in the [111] direction are prepared through topotactic decomposition of Mg(OH)2 nanosheets under dynamic vacuum. The surface is highly defect&#8208;rich with under&#8208;coordinated O and Mg ions and F&#8208;centers, which makes the MgO nanosheets highly active in interacting with CO probe molecules to form adsorbed species not observed before on other MgO systems.







Abstract
Synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials of nonlayered metal oxide is a challenge, especially when long&#8208;range single&#8208;crystallinity and clean high&#8208;energy surfaces are required. Reported here is the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline MgO(111) nanosheets by a two&#8208;step process involving the formation of ultrathin Mg(OH)2 nanosheets as a precursor, and their selective topotactic conversion upon heating under dynamic vacuum. The defect&#8208;rich surface displays terminal &#8208;OH groups, three&#8208;coordinated O2&#8722; sites and low&#8208;coordinated Mg2+ sites, as well as single electrons trapped at oxygen vacancies, which render the MgO nanosheets highly reactive, as evidenced by the activation of CO molecules at low temperatures and pressures with formation of strongly adsorbed red&#8208;shifted CO and coupling of CO molecules into C2 species.

         <title>Induction of Chirality in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Built from Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3087-3094, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral induction system based on achiral precursors has been developed, in which the driving force for chirality generation is an achiral template participating in a kinetic&#8208;controlled assembly process. The chiral generation process has been identified in detail through a template&#8208;involved key intermediate. Moreover, the targeted modification of template further makes the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk samples controllable.







Abstract
Induction of chirality from an achiral assembly system remains a huge challenge related to the origin of life. Here, induction of chirality in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built from achiral precursors has been realized. Assembling achiral H3BTB ligands and ZnII/CdII clusters leads to a 2D coordination polymer (FJI&#8208;H16), while introduction of achiral pyridine into such assembly system leads to a 3D chiral MOF (FJI&#8208;H27 (M) or (P)). The driven force for chiral generation has been proved to be a pyridine participated kinetic&#8208;control assembly process, which can be controlled by changing the amount of pyridine and temperature, from no induction to partial induction to complete induction. The chiral generation process has been identified in detail through a pyridine&#8208;involved key intermediate (FJI&#8208;H28). The targeted modification of pyridine can selectively lead to FJI&#8208;H27 (M) or FJI&#8208;H27 (P), making the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk FJI&#8208;H27 samples can be controlled. Our work not only represents a new chiral induction process that may relate to the chiral origin in nature, but also firstly reveals how achiral external stimuli generate chirality from achiral precursors, and offers a guide for rational preparation of chiral MOFs.

         <title>A Design Principle for Polar Assemblies with C3&#8208;Sym Bowl&#8208;Shaped &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3261-3267, February 8, 2021. </description>

Polar materials attract wide research interests because of their unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic effect. However, polar organic assemblies are limited due to the lack of rational synthetic strategies. Here, we report the first rational strategy to form polar organic crystals based on bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.







Abstract
Polar materials attract wide research interest due to their unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which are not accessible with nonpolar materials. However, in general, rationally designing polar materials is difficult because nonpolar materials are more favorable in terms of dipole&#8208;dipole interactions. Here, we report a rational strategy to form polar assemblies with bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and a molecular design principle for this strategy. We synthesized and thoroughly characterized 12 single crystals with the help of various theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that it can be possible to predict whether polar assemblies become more favorable or not by estimating their lattice energies. We believe that this study contributes to the development of organic polar materials and their related studies.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that it can be possible to predict whether polar assemblies become more favorable or not by estimating their lattice energies. We believe that this study contributes to the development of organic polar materials and their related studies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Flow Electrolyzer Mass Spectrometry with a Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3277-3282, February 8, 2021. </description>

A new technique, flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), is developed by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design. It enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities. The electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) is investigated and the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation determined.







Abstract
Operando mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to probe reaction intermediates near the surface of catalyst in electrochemical systems. For electrochemical reactions involving gas reactants, conventional operando mass spectrometry struggles in detecting reaction intermediates because the batch&#8208;type electrochemical reactor can only handle a very limited current density due to the low solubility of gas reactant(s). Herein, we developed a new technique, namely flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design, which enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities (&gt;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We investigated the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) on polycrystalline copper and elucidated the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation. Combining FEMS and isotopic labelling, we showed that the oxygen in the as&#8208;formed acetaldehyde intermediate originates from the reactant CO, while ethanol and n&#8208;propanol contained mainly solvent oxygen. The observation provides direct experimental evidence of an isotopic scrambling mechanism.

         <title>Reversibly Photo&#8208;Modulating Mechanical Stiffness and Toughness of Bioengineered Protein Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3222-3228, February 8, 2021. </description>

Bioengineered protein fibers were prepared through electrostatic complexation of a positively charged polypeptide and a negatively charged azobenzene&#8208;based surfactant. The photo&#8208;isomerization of the azobenzene moiety from E&#8208; to Z&#8208;isomer reversibly triggered a modulation of the bulk protein fiber's mechanical performance.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive materials have been extensively studied due to the attractive possibility of manipulating their properties with high spatiotemporal control in a non&#8208;invasive fashion. This stimulated the development of a series of photo&#8208;deformable smart devices. However, it remained a challenge to reversibly modulate the stiffness and toughness of bulk materials. Here, we present bioengineered protein fibers and their optomechanical manipulation by employing electrostatic interactions between supercharged polypeptides (SUPs) and an azobenzene (Azo)&#8208;based surfactant. Photo&#8208;isomerization of the Azo moiety from the E&#8208; to Z&#8208;form reversibly triggered the modulation of tensile strength, stiffness, and toughness of the bulk protein fiber. Specifically, the photo&#8208;induced rearrangement into the Z&#8208;form of Azo possibly strengthened cation&#8211;&#960; interactions within the fiber material, resulting in an around twofold increase in the fiber's mechanical performance. The outstanding mechanical and responsive properties open a path towards the development of SUP&#8208;Azo fibers as smart stimuli&#8208;responsive mechano&#8208;biomaterials.

         <title>An Efficient Conjugation Approach for Coupling Drugs to Native Antibodies via the PtII Linker Lx for Improved Manufacturability of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3008-3015, February 8, 2021. </description>

PtII complexes containing a payload, a bidentate ligand, and a halido leaving ligand (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; or I&#8722;) can be conjugated to native monoclonal antibodies in a very efficient way by using iodide salts, such as NaI, as simple inorganic additives to the aqueous conjugation mixtures. This method works reliably for various mAbs, consistently giving conjugation efficiencies in the range of 75&#8211;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
The PtII linker [ethylenediamineplatinum(II)]2+, coined Lx, has emerged as a novel non&#8208;conventional approach to antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) and has shown its potential in preclinical in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo benchmark studies. A crucial improvement of the Lx conjugation reaction from initially &lt;15&#8201;% to ca. 75&#8211;90&#8201;% conjugation efficiency is described, resulting from a systematic screening of all relevant reaction parameters. NaI, a strikingly simple inorganic salt additive, greatly improves the conjugation efficiency as well as the conjugation selectivity simply by exchanging the leaving chloride ligand on Cl&#8208;Lx&#8208;drug complexes (which are direct precursors for Lx&#8208;ADCs) for iodide, thus generating I&#8208;Lx&#8208;drug complexes as more reactive species. Using this iodide effect, we developed a general and highly practical conjugation procedure that is scalable: our lead Lx&#8208;ADC was produced on a 5&#8197;g scale with an outstanding conjugation efficiency of 89&#8201;%.

         <title>Chemoproteomics&#8208;Enabled De Novo Discovery of Photoswitchable Carboxylesterase Inhibitors for Optically Controlled Drug Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3071-3079, February 8, 2021. </description>

Here, we present a new chemoproteomic platform for the de novo discovery of photoswitchable serine hydrolase inhibitors. Using this platform, we identified highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzyme carboxylesterase and demonstrated the pharmacological application of our compounds by optically controlling the hydrolysis of an immunosuppressant drug.







Abstract
Herein, we report arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones as a novel class of photoswitchable serine hydrolase inhibitors and present a chemoproteomic platform for rapid discovery of optically controlled serine hydrolase targets in complex proteomes. Specifically, we identify highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes carboxylesterases 1 and 2 and demonstrate their pharmacological application by optically controlling the metabolism of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil. Collectively, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study provides a first example of photopharmacological tools to optically control drug metabolism by modulating the activity of a metabolizing enzyme. Our arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones offer synthetically accessible scaffolds that can be expanded to identify specific photoswitchable inhibitors for other serine hydrolases, including lipases, peptidases, and proteases. Our chemoproteomic platform can be applied to other photoswitches and scaffolds to achieve optical control over diverse protein classes.

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Poly(Tetrazine&#8208;co&#8208;Fluorene)&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Series of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2980-2986, February 8, 2021. </description>

A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.







Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.

&lt;p&gt;A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Synthesizing Nanorods from Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries against Drug Resistant Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3062-3070, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry was employed to explore an ideal carrier molecule for anti&#8208;cancer drug delivery. Driven by thermodynamics, the carrier molecule was quantitatively yielded by its co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a template and a drug doxorubicin (DOX). The self&#8208;assembled nanocarrier with a drug&#8208;loading content of 40&#8201;% was stable yet pH&#8208; and redox&#8208;responsive and could enhance drug potency and eliminate DOX&#8208;resistant cancer in vivo in 13&#8197;days.







Abstract
Molecular self&#8208;assembly has been widely used to develop nanocarriers for drug delivery. However, most of them have unsatisfactory drug loading capacity (DLC) and the dilemma between stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and stability, stagnating their translational process. Herein, we overcame these drawbacks using dynamic combinatorial chemistry. A carrier molecule was spontaneously and quantitatively synthesized, aided by co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a template molecule and an anti&#8208;cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) from a dynamic combinatorial library that was operated by disulfide exchange under thermodynamic control. The highly selective synthesis guaranteed a stable yet pH&#8208; and redox&#8208; responsive nanocarrier with a maximized DLC of 40.1&#8201;% and an enhanced drug potency to fight DOX resistance in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggested that harnessing the interplay between synthesis and self&#8208;assembly in complex chemical systems could yield functional nanomaterials for advanced applications.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Modulation of Electronic Density at Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Sites Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3212-3221, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance has been established by combining density&#8208;functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis. A metal&#8211;organic framework derived single&#8208;atom Co catalyst, comprising an optimal Co1&#8208;N3PS active moiety supported on hollow carbon polyhedron (Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC), was synthesized, and it exhibits superior alkaline and acidic ORR performance.







Abstract
Demonstrated here is the correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance by combining density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis. Guided by DFT calculations, a MOF&#8208;derived Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with the optimal Co1&#8208;N3PS active moiety incorporated in a hollow carbon polyhedron (Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC) was designed and synthesized. Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920&#8197;V and superior ORR kinetics with record&#8208;level kinetic current density and an ultralow Tafel slope of 31&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, exceeding that of Pt/C and almost all non&#8208;precious ORR electrocatalysts. In acidic media the ORR kinetics of Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC still surpasses that of Pt/C. This work offers atomic&#8208;level insight into the relationship between electronic density of the active site and catalytic properties, promoting rational design of efficient catalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Single&#8208;Site Nanozyme for Tumor&#8208;Specific Amplified Cascade Enzymatic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3001-3007, February 8, 2021. </description>

A self&#8208;assembled nanozyme with isolated Cu catalytic sites has been developed for a cascade enzymatic reaction: Tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase mimicking activity depleted intracellular glutathione and converted single&#8208;site CuII species into CuI species for subsequent amplified peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity through a Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8211;Weiss reaction (see picture). Abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals were thus generated for tumor cell apoptosis.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity (nanozymes) show potential for therapeutic interventions. However, it remains a formidable challenge to selectively kill tumor cells through enzymatic reactions, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Herein, we present a new strategy based on a single&#8208;site cascade enzymatic reaction for tumor&#8208;specific therapy that avoids off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. A copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu&#8208;HCF) nanozyme with active single&#8208;site copper exhibited cascade enzymatic activity within the tumor microenvironment: Tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase activity by the Cu&#8208;HCF single&#8208;site nanozymes (SSNEs) led to the depletion of intracellular glutathione and the conversion of single&#8208;site CuII species into CuI for subsequent amplified peroxidase activity through a Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8211;Weiss reaction. In this way, abundant highly toxic hydroxyl radicals were generated for tumor cell apoptosis. The results show that SSNEs could amplify the tumor&#8208;killing efficacy of reactive oxygen species and suppress tumor growth in vivo.

         <title>Rational Construction of Borromean Linked Crystalline Organic Polymers</title>

Herein, we, for the first time, developed an efficient and versatile supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to construct COFs with Borromean links, which have not been achieved yet in the literature. 







Abstract
Attributed to the unique topological complexity and elegant beauty, Borromean systems are attracting intense attention. However, at present, the construction of Borromean linked organic polymers remains a challenge. To address this formidable challenge, we developed a supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to fabricate Borromean linked organic polymer. The solvothermal condensation reaction of a judiciously selected trigonal pyramidal building block, 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantane, with linear dialdehyde building blocks allowed the construction of two rare covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity and robustness. Structure refinement unveiled the successful formation of entangled 2D&#8594;2D Borromean arrayed structures. Both the two COFs were of microporosity and thus demonstrated the potentials for gas separation. The successful synthesis of the first two Borromean linked organic polymers paves the avenue to expand the supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to other building blocks and topologies, and broadens the family and scope of COFs.

         <title>Nickel&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Organostibines with Organoboronic Acids</title>

A general strategy for the formation of antimony&#8211;carbon bond was developed through the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of halostibines with aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;boronic acids. The obtained stibines can be used as useful cross&#8208;coupling partners for further transformation towards boronic acids. The present study revealed chemical behaviors of stibines which react with aryl boronic acids to create Sb&#8722;C and C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A strategy for the formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bond was developed by nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of halostibines. This method has been applied to the synthesis of various triaryl&#8208; and diarylalkylstibines from the corresponding cyclic and acyclic halostibines. This protocol showed a wide substrate scope (72 examples) and was compatible to a wide range of functional groups such as aldehyde, ketone, alkene, alkyne, haloarenes (F, Cl, Br, I), and heteroarenes. A successful synthesis of arylated stibine 3&#8201;a in a scale of 34.77&#8197;g demonstrates high synthetic potential of this transformation. The formed stibines (R3Sb) were then used for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming reaction with aryl boronic acids [R&#8722;B(OH)2], giving biaryls with high selectivity, even the structures of two organomoieties (R and R&#8242;) are very similar. Plausible catalytic pathways were proposed based on control experiments.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Layers Hierarchically Integrate Three Synergistic Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>

A tri&#8208;functional metal&#8211;organic layer with [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizers and Hf12 secondary building units capped with triflate groups as strong Lewis acid sites and PPA&#8208;Co groups as hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalysts synergistically catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes, respectively.







Abstract
We report the design of a bifunctional metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL), Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co, composed of [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ [DBB&#8208;Ru, DBB=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] connecting ligand as a photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(PPA)Cl (PPA&#8208;Co, dmgH=dimethylglyoxime; PPA=4&#8208;pyridinepropionic acid) on the Hf12 secondary building unit (SBU) as a hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalyst. Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co efficiently catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of indolines and tetrahydroquinolines to afford indoles and quinolones. We extended this strategy to prepare Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf MOL with a [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizer and Hf12 SBU capped with triflate as strong Lewis acids and PPA&#8208;Co as a hydrogen transfer catalyst. With three synergistic active sites, Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf competently catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes with turnover numbers of up to 500 and 460, respectively, illustrating the potential use of MOLs in constructing novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Large Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane Cages: The Isolation of Functionalized POSS with an Unprecedented Si18O27 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3022-3027, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A POSS cage with a Si18O27 core is described. In contrast to previous large POSS cages (n&gt;16), our synthesis afforded a single isomeric form, unambiguously identified from among the nine possible isomers by NMR. This is the largest Tn compound isolated as a single isomer. A new ring strain model is described that correlates the chemical shifts of non&#8208;equivalent 29Si&#8197;NMR signals in POSS.







Abstract
The synthesis of organo&#8208;functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS, (R&#8208;SiO1.5)n, Tn) is an area of significant activity. To date, T14 is the largest such cage synthesized and isolated as a single isomer. Herein, we report an unprecedented, single&#8208;isomer styryl&#8208;functionalized T18 POSS. Unambiguously identified among nine possible isomers by multinuclear solution NMR (1H, 13C, and 29Si), MALDI&#8208;MS, FTIR, and computational studies, this is the largest single&#8208;isomer functionalized Tn compound isolated to date. A ring&#8208;strain model was developed to correlate the 29Si resonances with the number of 6&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and/or 4&#8208;Si&#8208;atom rings that each non&#8208;equivalent Si atom is part of. The model successfully predicts the speciation of non&#8208;equivalent Si atoms in other families of Tn compounds, demonstrating its general applicability for assigning 29Si resonances to Si atoms in cage silsesquioxanes and providing a useful tool for predicting Si&#8208;atom environments.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Induction of Chirality in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Built from Achiral Precursors (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 6/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3311-3311, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of chirality in a metal&#8211;organic framework built from achiral precursors through achiral&#8208;template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is demonstrated by Qihui Chen, Maochun Hong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;3087. The driving force for chirality generation is a template&#8208;driven kinetically controlled assembly process. The chirality generation process was identified in detail through transition&#8208;state capture.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction of chirality&lt;/b&gt; in a metal&#8211;organic framework built from achiral precursors through achiral&#8208;template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is demonstrated by Qihui Chen, Maochun Hong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202013885"&gt;page&#8197;3087&lt;/a&gt;. The driving force for chirality generation is a template&#8208;driven kinetically controlled assembly process. The chirality generation process was identified in detail through transition&#8208;state capture.

This Minireview unveils the story of ATP in the natural realm, its journey into the synthetic world for the realization of amazing structures and functions and its promises for next&#8208;generation materials.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecular unit of energy that drives various processes in the cellular environment. In this Minireview, we discuss the potential of physical and chemical properties of ATP for the development of bio&#8208;inspired, synthetic ATP&#8208;induced supramolecular systems with dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive and active assembly characteristics. Molecular design rules for ATP&#8208;induced assemblies with various architectures and their stimuli&#8208;responsive structural and functional response are categorized. Special attention is given to the immense potential of ATP&#8208;fuelled designs in the nascent field of transient/non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular polymerization for the synthesis of lifelike temporally programmable soft materials. Finally, the existing dearth and fate of ATP&#8208;driven systems for future challenges are discussed.

Abstract
Calixarenes (CAs), representing the third generation of supramolecular hosts and one of the most widely studied macrocyclic scaffolds, offer (almost) unlimited structure and application possibilities due to their ease of modification, which allows one to establish a large molecular library as a material basis for diverse biomedical applications. Moreover, CAs and their derivatives engage in various noncovalent interactions for the facile recognition of guests including bioactive molecules and are also important building blocks for the fabrication of supramolecular architectures. In view of their molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly properties, CAs are extensively applied in biosensing, bioimaging, and drug/gene delivery. Additionally, some CA derivatives exhibit biological activities and can therefore be used as new therapeutic agents. Herein, we summarize the diverse biomedical applications of CAs including in vitro diagnosis (biosensing), in vivo diagnosis (bioimaging), and therapy.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Borylation of Heteroarenes: Balancing Steric and Electronic Regiocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2796-2821, February 8, 2021. </description>

Which C&#8722;H bond? The iridium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H borylation reaction is a powerful method for the preparation of aromatic organoboronate esters. Sterically regulated regioselectivity dominates carbocyclic aromatic C&#8722;H borylation. In contrast, heterocyclic aromatics display a much greater influence from electronic effects. In this review, examples of heterocyclic C&#8722;H borylation are surveyed, and the origins of heterocyclic C&#8722;H borylation regioselectivities discussed.







Abstract
The iridium&#8208;catalysed borylation of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds has become the preferred method for the synthesis of aromatic organoboron compounds. The reaction is highly efficient, tolerant of a broad range of substituents and can be applied to both carbocyclic and heterocyclic substrates. The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H activation is dominated by steric considerations and there have been considerable efforts to develop more selective processes for less constrained substrates. However, most of these have focused on benzenoid&#8208;type substrates and in contrast, heteroarenes remain much desired but more challenging substrates with the position and/or nature of the heteroatom(s) significantly affecting reactivity and regioselectivity. This review will survey the borylation of heteroarenes, focusing on the influence of steric and electronic effects on regiochemical outcome and, by linking to current mechanistic understandings, will provide insights to what is currently possible and where further developments are required.

         <title>Stretchable Electrochemical Sensors for Cell and Tissue Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2757-2767, February 8, 2021. </description>

Emerging stretchable electrodes open up new opportunities for the real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecule release from deformed cells, soft tissues, and organisms. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in the fabrication of stretchable electrochemical sensors and their representative applications in cell, tissue, and in vivo detection.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensing based on conventional rigid electrodes has great restrictions for characterizing biomolecules in deformed cells or soft tissues. The recent emergence of stretchable sensors allows electrodes to conformally contact to curved surfaces and perfectly comply with the deformation of living cells and tissues. This provides a powerful strategy to monitor biomolecules from mechanically deformed cells, tissues, and organisms in real time, and opens up new opportunities to explore the mechanotransduction process. In this minireview, we first summarize the fabrication of stretchable electrodes with emphasis on the nanomaterial&#8208;enabled strategies. We then describe representative applications of stretchable sensors in the real&#8208;time monitoring of mechanically sensitive cells and tissues. Finally, we present the future possibilities and challenges of stretchable electrochemical sensing in cell, tissue, and in vivo detection.

         <title>Acquiring High&#8208;TC Layered Metal Halide Ferroelectrics via Cage&#8208;Confined Ethylamine Rotators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2839-2843, February 8, 2021. </description>

By incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, two 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics were obtained: (IBA)2(EA)Pb2Br7 (IBA=isobutylammonium) and (IBA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10. Structural and computational analyses suggest that the improvement of the Curie temperature in these materials is due to the higher phase&#8208;transition energy barrier triggered by the cage&#8208;confined EA rotators with increasing layer thickness.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest in the field of optoelectronics due to the combination of excellent semiconducting and ferroelectric properties. The Curie temperature (TC), below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on TC tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)2(EA)Pb2Br7 (2L; IBA=isobutylammonium), and (IBA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10 (3L). Intriguingly, TC is successfully tuned from 326&#8197;K (2L) to 370&#8197;K (3L) with increasing layer thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that the improvement of TC is due to the higher phase&#8208;transition energy barrier triggered by the cage&#8208;confined EA rotators with increased layer thickness. This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;TC 2D OIHP ferroelectrics.

Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(EA)Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2L&lt;/b&gt;; IBA=isobutylammonium), and (IBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(EA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3L&lt;/b&gt;). Intriguingly, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is successfully tuned from 326&#8197;K (&lt;b&gt;2L&lt;/b&gt;) to 370&#8197;K (&lt;b&gt;3L&lt;/b&gt;) with increasing layer thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that the improvement of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the higher phase&#8208;transition energy barrier triggered by the cage&#8208;confined EA rotators with increased layer thickness. This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; 2D OIHP ferroelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stereospecific Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of Norbornene Catalyzed by Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2934-2938, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homoleptic iron complex catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene to yield highly stereoregular polynorbornene (99&#8201;% cis, syndiotactic). The influence of solvent, temperature, and additives was examined.







Abstract
Developing well&#8208;defined iron&#8208;based catalysts for olefin metathesis would be a breakthrough achievement in the field not only to replace existing catalysts by inexpensive metals but also to attain a new reactivity taking advantage of the unique electronic structure of the base metals. Here, we present a two&#8208;coordinate homoleptic iron complex, Fe(HMTO)2 [HMTO=O&#8208;2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3], that is capable of performing ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene to produce highly stereoregular polynorbornene (99&#8201;% cis, syndiotactic). The use of heteroleptic Fe(HMTO)(RO) [RO=(CH3)2CF3CO, CH3(CF3)2CO, or Ph(CF3)2CO] prepared in&#8197;situ significantly increases the polymerization rate while preserving selectivity. The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular Heck and Reductive Heck Reactions of Aryl Triflates, Mesylates, and Tosylates Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2828-2832, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalysts efficiently promote enantioselective Heck reaction of aryl triflates, mesylates and tosylates in excellent ee values. Asymmetric reductive Heck reaction with a ketal of 2&#8208;cyclopentenone also proceeds well, which is equivalent to conjugate arylation of the enone itself.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular Heck reaction of cycloalkenes proceeds well with aryl triflates, mesylates and tosylates in excellent enantiomeric ratios. The asymmetric reductive Heck reaction also works with a 2&#8208;cyclopentenone ketal, which is equivalent to conjugate arylation of the enone itself.

         <title>Single Platinum Atom Doping to Silver Clusters Enables Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2822-2827, February 8, 2021. </description>

PtAg24(SR)18 (SR=2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters serve as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, Pt&#8208;doping significantly increases the intersystem crossing yield of the cluster through spin&#8211;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag12 icosahedral core.







Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) from near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible has been realized using singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet absorption of sensitizers, which are currently limited to osmium complexes and semiconductor nanocrystals. Motivated by the atomically precise tunability of electronic structure and photophysical properties of noble metal clusters, which often possess absorption bands that extend into the NIR region, we investigated MAg24(SR)18 (M=Ag, Pt; SR=2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation UC. Combined with a blue light emitter, the NIR excitation (&#955;ex=785&#8197;nm) of Ag25(SR)18 results in no UC emission, while PtAg24(SR)18 exhibits strong UC emission. This enhancement is primarily due to a significant increase in the intersystem crossing quantum yield of the cluster associated with the spin&#8211;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag12 core.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Large Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films on Copper Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2887-2891, February 8, 2021. </description>

A controllable electrochemical synthesis method of MOF films is developed, and opens the door to the fabrication of large&#8208;scale 2D MOF films. Industrial&#8208;scale continuous production of large&#8208;scale MOF films may be realized via this technology, which can promote their application in the field of microelectronic devices.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent physical and electrical properties, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with well&#8208;defined supramolecular structures have received extensive research attention. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF films is still a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical (EC) synthesis method for the preparation of large&#8208;area Cu3(HHTP)2 MOF film on single&#8208;crystal Cu (100) anode. The surface reaction was achieved via charge&#8208;induced molecular assembly. The synthesized MOF film exhibited a high crystalline quality with an electrical conductivity of approximately 0.087&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which was around 1000 times larger than the previously reported values for the same material prepared by the interface method. In addition, Cu2(MTCP), Cu3(BTPA)2, and Cu3(TPTC)2 MOF films were synthesized on Cu foil with the same strategy, which confirmed the universality of the proposed method. This controllable EC method can be effectively applied to the industrial&#8208;scale production of 2D MOF films on Cu foil.

The one&#8208;electron reduction of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borylene carbonyl complex yields a dimeric borylketyl radical anion, resulting from an intramolecular aryl migration to the CO carbon atom. Computational analyses support the existence of a [(CAAC)B(CO)Ar].&#8722; radical anion intermediate. Further reduction leads to a highly nucleophilic dianionic (boraneylidene)methanolate.

         <title>Reaction Acceleration at Solid/Solution Interfaces: Katritzky Reaction Catalyzed by Glass Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2929-2933, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass particles accelerate the Katritzky reaction, as shown by a &#8776;100&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate. Evidence shows that glass acts as a &#8220;green&#8221; heterogeneous catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture.







Abstract
The Katritzky reaction in bulk solution at room temperature is accelerated significantly by the surface of a glass container compared to a plastic container. Remarkably, the reaction rate is increased by more than two orders of magnitude upon the addition of glass particles with the rate increasing linearly with increasing amounts of glass. A similar phenomenon is observed when glass particles are added to levitated droplets, where large acceleration factors are seen. Evidence shows that glass acts as a &#8220;green&#8221; heterogeneous catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture. Reaction acceleration at two separate interfaces is recognized in this study: i)&#8197;air/solution phase acceleration, as is well known in microdroplets; ii)&#8197;solid/solution phase, where such acceleration appears to be a new phenomenon.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Diterpene Waihoensene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2939-2942, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, racemic, and enantioselective total synthesis of the diterpene waihoensene is presented. Key steps are a radical cyclization, a Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction, and an asymmetric allylic decarboxylative allylation (AAA) reaction to obtain optical active material.







Abstract
A racemic and scalable enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;waihoensene was accomplished. (+)&#8208;Waihoensene belongs to the diterpene natural product family, and it features an angular triquinane substructure motif. Its tetracyclic [6.5.5.5]backbone is all&#8208;cis&#8208;fused, containing six contiguous stereocenters, four of which are quaternary. These structural features were efficiently installed by means of a diastereoselective radical cyclization, followed by an intramolecular Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction, a diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and a diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction. Enantioselectivity was introduced at an early stage, by an asymmetric palladium catalyzed decarboxylative allylation reaction on gram scale.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Visual Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

In situ real&#8208;time detection of the kinetically controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine derivatives was possible on the basis of vibration&#8208;induced emission and the induction of circularly polarized luminescence (see picture). Through excited&#8208;state engineering, the spectra enabled investigation of the relationship between molecular aggregation and conformational change.







Abstract
The construction of artificial structures through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly based on noncovalent interactions, as well as monitoring during the self&#8208;assembly process, are important aspects of dynamic supramolecular chemistry. Herein we describe the complex dynamics of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine derivatives (S)/(R)&#8208;DPAC, whose different assemblies were found to have distinct optical and morphological characteristics. With ratiometric fluorescence originating from vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE), the self&#8208;assembly process from kinetic traps to the thermodynamic equilibrium state could be monitored in real time by optical spectrometry. During the morphology transformation from particles to nanobricks, strong circularly polarized luminescence was induced with glum=1.6&#215;10&#8722;2. The excited&#8208;state characteristics of the self&#8208;assemblies enabled investigation of the relationship between molecular aggregation and conformational change, thus allowing effective monitoring of the sophisticated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process.

         <title>A High Yield Synthesis of an Octastannacubane and a Bis(silyl) Stannylene via Reductive Elimination of a Silane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2898-2902, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high yield synthesis (70&#8201;%) of a novel octastannacubane 2 under mild conditions (50&#8201;&#176;C) involves reductive elimination of two silane molecules from a 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrasilyldistannane 1 followed by tetramerization. A mechanism for the 1&#8594;2 transformation is proposed by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Thermolysis of tris(silyl) tin hydride 2 at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;hours results in elimination of tBu2MeSiH and generation of bis(silyl) stannylene 3 which dimerizes instantaneously yielding distannene 4. Compound 3 can be trapped by NHCMe yielding stannylene&#8208;NHCMe complex 5. Upon heating (70&#8201;&#176;C, 24&#8197;h) 4 yields stannyl radical 8 along with pentastannatricyclo[2.1.0.02,&#8201;5]pentane 10 (ca. 30&#8201;%) and traces (ca. 5&#8201;%) of the novel octastannacubane 9. Remarkably, octastannacubane 9 is produced in 70&#8201;% yield by mild heating (50&#8201;&#176;C) of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrasilyldistannane 11, along with tBu2MeSiH. Octastannacubane 9 was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Based on DFT quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations the 11 &#8594; 9 transformation occurs via reductive elimination of two tBu2MeSiH molecules from 11 yielding a distannyne, (or its bis&#8208;stannylene isomer), followed by its tetramerization.

         <title>Direct Self&#8208;Assembly of MXene on Zn Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A MXene&#8208;coated Zn (MZn) anode was fabricated by an in&#8197;situ spontaneously reducing/assembling strategy, which effectively decreases the Zn nucleation energy barrier and uniformizes electric field distribution. The dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode not only exhibits prolonged cycle life and lower voltage hysteresis, but also endows Zn/MnO2 batteries with the excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Metallic zinc is a promising anode candidate of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, Zn anodes usually suffer from dendrite and side reactions, which will degrade their cycle stability and reversibility. Herein, we developed an in&#8197;situ spontaneously reducing/assembling strategy to assemble a ultrathin and uniform MXene layer on the surface of Zn anodes. The MXene layer endows the Zn anode with a lower Zn nucleation energy barrier and a more uniformly distributed electric field through the favorable charge redistribution effect in comparison with pure Zn. Therefore, MXene&#8208;integrated Zn anode exhibits obviously low voltage hysteresis and excellent cycling stability with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors, ensuring the high capacity retention and low polarization potential in zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Lanthanum&#8208;Filled Carbon&#8211;Boron Clathrate</title>

High&#8208;pressure synthesis reveals LaB3C3, a La&#8208;stuffed, carbon&#8211;boron clathrate in the bipartite sodalite structure. Trivalent La3+ allows charge balance with the [B3C3]3&#8722; framework, resulting in a semiconducting material at improved synthetic conditions. Robust sp3 covalent bonds produce high strength and hardness, while different guest atoms within the clathrate cages allow the possibility for tunable electronic properties.







Abstract
We report a carbon&#8208;boron clathrate with composition 2&#8201;La@B6C6 (LaB3C3). Like recently reported SrB3C3,[1] single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational modelling indicate that the isostructural La member crystallizes in the cubic bipartite sodalite structure (Type&#8208;VII clathrate) with La atoms encapsulated within truncated octahedral cages composed of alternating carbon and boron atoms. The covalent nature of the B&#8722;C bonding results in a hard, incompressible framework, and owing to the balanced electron count, La3+[B3C3]3&#8722; exhibits markedly improved pressure stability and is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap predicted near 1.3&#8197;eV. A variety of different guest atoms may potentially be substituted within Type&#8208;VII clathrate cages, presenting opportunities for a large family of boron&#8208;stabilized, carbon&#8208;based clathrates with ranging physical properties.

         <title>Chiral Molecular Propellers of Triarylborane Ammonia Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2958-2962, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using VCD spectroscopy as key analytical tool, it was found that point chirality in side chains of chiral triarylborane&#8211;ammonia adducts, which feature intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to the dative N&#8594;B bond, can efficiently be transferred to triarylborane propeller chirality.







Abstract
Chiral molecular propeller conformations have been induced to various triaryl structures including trityl derivatives and triaryl boranes. For borane&#8211;amine adducts, such induced propeller chirality has not been reported yet due to the low energy barrier for racemization in common triarylboranes such as B(C6H5)3 or B(C6F5)3. Herein, we demonstrate that point chirality in side chains of chiral triarylborane&#8211;ammonia adducts, which feature intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to the dative N&#8594;B bond, can efficiently be transferred to triarylborane propeller chirality. Employing X&#8208;ray crystallography and ECD/VCD spectroscopy for structural characterizations, we investigate three examples with different steric demands of the incorporated chiral alkoxy side groups. We elucidate the conformational preferences of the molecular propellers. Furthermore, we show that computationally predicted conformational preferences obtained for the isolated, only implicitly solvated molecules are actually opposite to the experimentally observed ones.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration of Mesoionic Carbenes (iMICs)</title>

Super&#8208;iMICs (5) with the largest buried volume (Vbur=45&#8201;%) known thus far for iMICs are accessible via unprecedented Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of C5&#8208;protonated iMICs (2) to 3, subsequent N&#8208;alkylation of 3 to 4, and the deprotonation of 4. S&#8208;iMICs (5) are stronger &#963;&#8208;donors and superior &#960;&#8208;acceptors than 2. A comparative catalytic study reveals superior activity of S&#8208;iMICs (5) over iMICs (2) and NHC (IPr).







Abstract
Intramolecular 1,2&#8208;Dipp migration of seven mesoionic carbenes (iMICAr) 2&#8201;a&#8211;g (iMICAr=ArC{N(Dipp)}2CHC; Ar=aryl; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) under nickel catalysis to give 1,3&#8208;imidazoles (IMDAr) 3&#8201;a&#8211;g (IMDAr=ArC{N(Dipp)CHC(Dipp)N}) has been reported. The formation of 3 indicates the cleavage of an N&#8722;CDipp bond and the subsequent formation of a C&#8722;CDipp bond in 2, which is unprecedented in NHC chemistry. The use of 3 in accessing super&#8208;iMICs (5) (S&#8208;iMIC=ArC{N(Dipp)N(Me)C(Dipp)}C) has been shown with selenium (6), gold (7), and palladium (8) compounds. The quantification of the stereoelectronic properties reveals the superior &#963;&#8208;donor strength of 5 compared to that of classical NHCs. Remarkably, the percentage buried volume of 5 (%Vbur=45) is the largest known amongst thus far reported iMICs. Catalytic studies show a remarkable activity of 5, which is consistent with their auspicious stereoelectronic features.

Thiyl radical originating from a fluorinated disulfide can activate alkanes under metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction becomes possible due to unique reactivity profile of the thiyl radical bearing the fluorinated pyridine fragment.







Abstract
A metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free thiyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of alkanes is described. Tetrafluoropyridinyl disulfide is used to perform thiolation of the C&#8722;H bonds under irradiation with 400&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes. The key C&#8722;H activation step is believed to proceed via hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction effected by the fluorinated thiyl radical. Secondary, tertiary, and heteroatom&#8208;substituted C&#8722;H bonds can be involved in the thiolation reaction. The resulting sulfides have wide potential as photoredox&#8208;active radical precursors in reactions with alkenes and heteroarenes.

&lt;p&gt;Thiyl radical originating from a fluorinated disulfide can activate alkanes under metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction becomes possible due to unique reactivity profile of the thiyl radical bearing the fluorinated pyridine fragment.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible RNA Activation Compatible with Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Ligation</title>

         <dc:description>
A plausible scenario for the prebiotic generation of activated RNA substrates under mild aqueous conditions is presented. Using water&#8208;soluble diamidophosphate, in&#8197;situ production of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate&#8208;activated oligoribonucleotides and their subsequent ligation by a ribozyme can be achieved.







Abstract
RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation is widely believed to be a key reaction for primordial biology. However, since typical chemical routes towards activating RNA substrates are incompatible with ribozyme catalysis, it remains unclear how prebiotic systems generated and sustained pools of activated building blocks needed to form increasingly larger and complex RNA. Herein, we demonstrate in situ activation of RNA substrates under reaction conditions amenable to catalysis by the hairpin ribozyme. We found that diamidophosphate (DAP) and imidazole drive the formation of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate RNA mono&#8208; and oligonucleotides from monophosphorylated precursors in frozen water&#8208;ice. This long&#8208;lived activation enables iterative enzymatic assembly of long RNAs. Our results provide a plausible scenario for the generation of higher&#8208;energy substrates required to fuel ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA synthesis in the absence of a highly evolved metabolism.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Based DABNA Analogues as Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials for Narrowband Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Carbazole&#8208;based DABNA analogues (CzDABNAs) were synthesized from triarylamine by regioselective one&#8208;shot single and double borylation. The facile and scalable method enabled synthesis of CzDABNAs exhibiting narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence and the preparation of highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices showing deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, and green emission.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based DABNA analogues (CzDABNAs) were synthesized from triarylamine by regioselective one&#8208;shot single and double borylation. The reaction proceeded selectively at the ortho position of the carbazolyl group, where the highest occupied molecular orbital is mainly localized owing to the difference in the electron&#8208;donating abilities of the diarylamino and carbazolyl groups. The facile and scalable method enabled synthesis of CzDABNAs, exhibiting narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence with emission spectra ranging from deep blue to green. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices employing these products as emitters exhibited deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, and green emission with high external quantum efficiencies of 19.5, 21.8, and 26.7&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Precise Fixation of an NO Molecule inside Carbon Nanopores: A Long&#8208;Range Electron&#8211;Nuclear Interaction</title>

Two chemical species could be placed at an accurate distance from one another by using [60]fullerene&#8208;based associative carbon nanopores. The paramagnetism of an NO molecule showed a strong Fermi contact interaction with the host nanopore, and a long&#8208;range pseudocontact interaction was observed with a water molecule trapped inside a paired host cage (see picture).







Abstract
[60]Fullerene&#8208;based carbon nanopores were synthesized to enable the placement of two molecules of nitric oxide (NO) at an accurate distance from one another. A linear orientation of the two NO molecules inside the assembled nanopores was confirmed crystallographically. Theoretical studies suggested possible free rotation inside the carbon nanopore, while the two conformations of NO in which its long axis was oriented toward the orifice of the nanopore were predicted to be dominant. The paramagnetic shifts caused by NO showed a major contribution from the Fermi contact mechanism. The Solomon&#8211;Bloembergen theory was found to describe well the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of a water molecule in a paired nanopore even under equilibrium as a result of fixing of the NO molecule with a distance of approximately 12&#8197;&#197;, thus demonstrating a long&#8208;range bimolecular magnetic interaction.

Synthetic routes, including trisubstituted olefin formation and cyclization, were optimized for synthesizing three different heteroatom&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs (H&#8208;rubicenes, ABTs, and IDTs) in relatively high overall yields. Finally, crystal structures, optoelectronic, radiationless processes, and charge transport properties of chalcogen&#8208;containing rubicenes were investigated to show their potential for organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Synthetic routes for heteroatom&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (H&#8208;PAHs) with alkyl and aryl substitution are demonstrated. Three H&#8208;PAHs, including heteroatom&#8208;containing rubicenes (H&#8208;rubicenes), angular&#8208;benzothiophenes (ABTs), and indenothiophene (IDTs) were successfully synthesized by two key steps, including polysubstituted olefin formation and cyclization. Specifically, ABT and H&#8208;rubicenes were comprehensively investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, transient absorption, and single&#8208;crystal OFET measurements.

A novel one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from ortho&#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes has been developed. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental investigation together with the theoretical calculations, which involves an unprecedented 1,4&#8208;boron migration process.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate a novel one&#8208;pot synthetic method towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs, 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;o), including hitherto unknown B&#8208;doped zethrene derivatives, from ortho&#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes with high atom efficiency and broad substrate scopes. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental investigation together with the theoretical calculations, which involves a unique 1,4&#8208;boron migration process. The resultant benchtop&#8208;stable B&#8208;PAHs are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we demonstrate a novel one&#8208;pot synthetic method towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;o&lt;/b&gt;), including hitherto unknown B&#8208;doped zethrene derivatives, from &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes with high atom efficiency and broad substrate scopes. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental investigation together with the theoretical calculations, which involves a unique 1,4&#8208;boron migration process. The resultant benchtop&#8208;stable B&#8208;PAHs are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies. The blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices based on &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;f&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;k&lt;/b&gt; are further fabricated, demonstrating the promising application potential of B&#8208;PAHs in organic optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical Benzylic C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2943-2947, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidative C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction with excellent site selectivity for benzylic positions is presented. The electrochemical C&#8722;H amination reaction employs easily available starting materials and proceeds under mild conditions without need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts and external chemical oxidants.







Abstract
C&#8722;H/N&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling is an ideal strategy to synthesize various amines but remains challenging owing to the requirement for sacrificial chemical oxidants and the difficulty in controlling the regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective electrochemical amination reaction that can convert benzylic C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8208;N linkages via H2 evolution without need for external oxidants or metal catalysts. The synthetic strategy involves anodic cleavage of benzylic C&#8722;H to form a carbocation intermediate, which is then trapped with an amine nucleophile leading to C&#8722;N bond formation. Key to the success is to include HFIP as a co&#8208;solvent to modulate the oxidation potentials of the alkylbenzene substrate and the aminated product to avoid overoxidation of the latter.

         <title>Combining a Titanium&#8211;Organic Cage and a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Cage for Highly Effective Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optics</title>

The supramolecular self&#8208;assembly between metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic cages (HOCs) is realized in an MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal composed of tetrahedral Ti4L6 cages and [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] cages generated in&#8197;situ. The MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal thin film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.







Abstract
Many metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and a few hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic cages (HOCs) have been investigated, but little is reported about cooperative self&#8208;assembly of MOCs and HOCs. Herein, we describe an unprecedented MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal composed of tetrahedral Ti4L6 (L=embonate) cages and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] (TIPA=tris(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine) cages. Chiral transfer is observed from the enantiopure Ti4L6 cage to enantiopure [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] cage. Two homochiral supramolecular frameworks with opposite handedness (PTC&#8208;235(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;235(&#923;)) are formed. Such MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal features high stability in water and other solvents, affording single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to trap CH3CN molecules and identify disordered NH4+ cations. A tablet pressing method is developed to test the third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property of KBr&#8208;based PTC&#8208;235 thin film. Such a thin film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.

         <title>Dual Emission of a Free&#8208;Base 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation from its cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;NH Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2915-2919, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a bilindione with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride afforded a free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation. This compound exhibits unusual NH tautomerism, wherein the cis form is more stable than the trans form due to effective charge delocalization, which manifests in dual emission.







Abstract
Replacement of the meso methine carbon atoms of porphyrins with heteroatoms is a powerful strategy for tuning their optical and electronic properties. In particular, 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin is an attractive target due to its importance as an intermediate in heme catabolism. In this work, we describe the synthesis and properties of a free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation, which was prepared by the ring&#8208;closure of a bilindione with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. This free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation exhibits dual fluorescence originating from its unique NH tautomerism. In contrast to normal porphyrins, the cis form of the 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation is more stable than the trans form due to the effective delocalization of its positive charge. We thus demonstrate here that meso&#8208;modified heteroporphyrins enable the manipulation of NH tautomerism in porphyrinic macrocycles.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Sulfonyl Hydrazides</title>

A highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with sulfonyl hydrazides by using a palladium catalyst containing a monodentate chiral spiro phosphoramidite ligand is reported. The reaction provides a new strategy for the synthesis of chiral allylic sulfones in high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been realized by using a palladium catalyst containing a monodentate chiral spiro phosphoramidite ligand. The reaction provided an efficient approach to synthetically useful chiral allylic sulfones. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the chiral allylic sulfone product. The transformation of the allyl hydrazine intermediate to the product is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

Inspired by natural rhodopsin, a natural chromophore retinal guest with visible&#8208;light isomerization was introduced into a solid&#8208;state membrane channel. A novel ethyl&#8208;urea&#8208;derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6) host, capable of selectively binding Cl&#8722;, was self&#8208;assembled with the retinal guest. Based on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsiveness of the host&#8211;guest system, Cl&#8722; transport can be regulated by visible light between ON and OFF states.







Abstract
Inspired by the light&#8208;regulating capabilities of naturally occurring rhodopsin, we have constructed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated Cl&#8722;&#8208;transport membrane channel based on a supramolecular host&#8211;guest interaction. A natural retinal chromophore, capable of a visible&#8208;light response, is used as the guest and grafted into the artificial channel. Upon introduction of an ethyl&#8208;urea&#8208;derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6) host, threading or de&#8208;threading of the retinal and selective bonding of Cl&#8722; can be utilized to regulate ion transport. Based on the visible&#8208;light responsiveness of the host&#8211;guest interaction, Cl&#8722; transport can be regulated by visible light between ON and OFF states. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated Cl&#8722; transport as a chemical model permits to understand comparable biological ion&#8208;selective transport behaviors. Furthermore, this result also supplies a smart visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive Cl&#8722; transporter, which may have applications in natural photoelectric conversion and photo&#8208;controlled delivery systems.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Induced Interfacial Aggregation of Porphyrins for Structuring Color&#8208;Tunable Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2871-2876, February 8, 2021. </description>

Multicolored structured liquids were prepared by tuning the aggregation of porphyrin. J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates of H4TPPS2&#8722; and H&#8208;aggregates of H2TPPS4&#8722; were formed by the electrostatic interaction between H4TPPS2&#8722; and polymer ligands.







Abstract
Locking nonequilibrium shapes of liquids into targeted architectures by interfacial jamming of nanoparticles is an emerging area in material science. 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) shows three different aggregation states that present an absorption imaging platform to monitor the assembly and jamming of supramolecular polymer surfactants (SPSs) at the liquid/liquid interface. The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2&#8722; dissolved in water, from J&#8208; to an H&#8208;aggregation was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine&#8208;terminated polystyrene dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color&#8208;tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the SPSs formed between H4TPPS2&#8722; and amine&#8208;terminated polystyrene. However, the formed SPSs cannot lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. In addition, a self&#8208;wrinkling behavior was observed when amphiphilic triblock copolymers of PS&#8208;block&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) were used to interact with H4TPPS2&#8722;. Subsequently, the SPSs formed can lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids.

         <title>Umpolung of B&#8722;H Bonds by Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation with Cyclopentadienone Iridium Complexes</title>

Conventional heterolytic cleavage of a B&#8722;H bond provides a B cation and an H anion. However, umpolung of the B&#8722;H bond in HBpin by novel cyclopentadienone iridium complexes led to cleavage into a B anion on the metal and an H cation on the phenolic oxygen atom of the ligand (see scheme).







Abstract
In contrast to conventional metal&#8211;ligand cooperative cleavage of a B&#8722;H bond, which provides a B cation on the ligand and an H anion on the metal, we report herein the umpolung of B&#8722;H bonds by novel cyclopentadienone iridium complexes. The B&#8722;H bonds of 4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolane (HBpin) and 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediaminatoborane (HBdan) were cleaved to give a B anion on the metal and an H cation on the phenolic oxygen atom of the ligand. Mechanistic investigation by DFT calculations revealed that the alkoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienone ligand facilitated deprotonation from Ir&#8722;H after oxidative addition of the B&#8722;H bond to give the umpolung product. The generated boryliridium complex was found to undergo borylation of an allyl halide in the presence of base, thus showing the nucleophilic nature of the boron atom.

         <title>Highly Robust Iron Catalyst System for Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation Leading to &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

Herein, a highly robust air&#8208;stable iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation is disclosed for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactams. A series of experimental and computational mechanistic investigations suggest a radical stepwise pathway involving an imidyl nitrenoid intermediate. The air compatibility and high turnover numbers (up to 47&#8201;000) of the iron catalyst system were rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Disclosed here is the use of an iron catalyst system for an intramolecular C&#8722;H amidation toward &#947;&#8208;lactam synthesis from dioxazolone precursors. (Phthalocyanine)FeIIICl was found to catalyze this cyclization with extremely high turnover numbers of up to 47&#8201;000 under mild and aerobic conditions. On the basis of experimental and computational mechanistic studies, the reaction is suggested to proceed by a stepwise radical pathway involving fast hydrogen atom abstraction followed by radical rebound. A plausible origin for the high turnover numbers along with air&#8208;compatibility is also rationalized.

         <title>Defects on CoS2&#8722;x: Tuning Redox Reactions for Sustainable Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2903-2908, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the newly constructed CoS2&#8722;x/Fe2+ system, sustainably&#8208;released 1O2 was proven to be the main reactive oxygen species, which came from the conversion of .O2&#8722; generated after O2 was reduced by electrons on the surface of CoS2&#8722;x (oxygen reduction reaction; ORR). Fe2+ promoted the generation of O2&#8722; and the decomposition of a small amount of H2O2 produced by ORR. The CoS2&#8722;x/Fe2+ system achieved a long&#8208;term effective degradation of organic pollutants for up to 30&#8197;days.







Abstract
It is important to develop self&#8208;producing reactive oxygen species (ROSs) systems and maintain the continuous and effective degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, for the first time, a system of ultrasound&#8208;treated CoS2&#8722;x mixed with Fe2+ is constructed to sustainably release singlet oxygen (1O2) for the effective degradation of various organic pollutants, including dyes, phenols, and antibiotics. Ultrasonic treatment produces defects on the surface of CoS2 which promote the production of ROSs and the circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+. With the help of Co4+/Co3+ exposed on the surface of CoS2&#8722;x, the directional conversion of superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) to 1O2 is realized. The CoS2&#8722;x/Fe2+ system can degrade organic pollutants efficiently for up to 30&#8197;days, which is significantly better than the currently recognized CuPx system (&lt;3&#8197;days).

&lt;p&gt;In the newly constructed CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; system, sustainably&#8208;released &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was proven to be the main reactive oxygen species, which came from the conversion of &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generated after O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was reduced by electrons on the surface of CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (oxygen reduction reaction; ORR). Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; promoted the generation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the decomposition of a small amount of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by ORR. The CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; system achieved a long&#8208;term effective degradation of organic pollutants for up to 30&#8197;days.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to develop self&#8208;producing reactive oxygen species (ROSs) systems and maintain the continuous and effective degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, for the first time, a system of ultrasound&#8208;treated CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; mixed with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is constructed to sustainably release singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for the effective degradation of various organic pollutants, including dyes, phenols, and antibiotics. Ultrasonic treatment produces defects on the surface of CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which promote the production of ROSs and the circulation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. With the help of Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; exposed on the surface of CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, the directional conversion of superoxide radical (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is realized. The CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; system can degrade organic pollutants efficiently for up to 30&#8197;days, which is significantly better than the currently recognized CuP&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; system (&amp;lt;3&#8197;days). Therefore, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; provides a new choice for the long&#8208;term remediation of organic pollutants in controlling large area river pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

Efficient His conjugation towards Lx&#8208;ADCs was achieved by an unprecedented coupling of platinum(II)&#8208;based drug&#8208;bearing precursors to native mAbs. This novel and easily scalable bioconjugation approach was realized by the addition of simple iodide salts such as NaI, as described by Eugen Merkul et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;3008. Cover designed by Tom van&#8197;Rheenen.
