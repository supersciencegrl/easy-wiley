         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a strategy of selectively breaking the C(sp3)&#8208;O bonds using commercially available low&#8208;cost Lewis acid (LA) and reconstructing the broken C(sp3)&#8208;N bonds with NaOH to high&#8208;efficiently and fully recycle EPs waste into high&#8208;value platform chemicals firstly, that is bisphenol A (BPA) and 4,4'&#8208;methylenebis (N, N'&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80). The yield of BPA is 93% wt. with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt.% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100 % recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Due to its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and byproducts, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable 2&#8208;Pyridylboron Reagents: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 2&#8208;Pyridylation Reaction of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridyl organoboron reagents has been developed. The merger of the reagents with a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling condition enables a robust and efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.







Abstract
The stability of 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents is a long&#8208;standing issue in cross&#8208;coupling chemistry due to hydrolysis. However, as the use of pyridine&#8208;based pharmaceuticals continues to increase, there is a high demand for stable and reactive 2&#8208;pyridylation reagents. Herein, a general strategy to prepare water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents has been developed. The application of the water&#8208;stable 2&#8208;pyridylboron reagents in a neutral Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling with a halide scavenger enables an efficient 2&#8208;pyridylation reaction of aryl halides.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Allows Control of Remote Stereochemistry in Asymmetric Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral ligand and a racemic keto&#8208;alcohol starting material allows a hydrogen borrowing cyclisation reaction to form products with both high yields and high enantioselectivity. The excellent yields and enantiomeric purities of the products formed from a racemic starting material are indicative of a dynamic kinetic resolution process involving a base labile cyclohexene intermediate. Finally, the cyclic products can be easily manipulated to a wide range of enantiopure acyl cyclohexanes.







Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;substituted ketones via hydrogen borrowing alkylation of both racemic linear precursors and 1,5&#8208;diols is described. The base mediated racemization of an intermediate cyclohexenone to facilitates a dynamic kinetic resolution, affording highly enantioenriched cyclohexanes in excellent yields, which could be further functionalized by removal of the Ph* group. DFT modelling revealed the mode of enantioinduction to be a stepwise process comprising of a hydride transfer and a coordination change to a &#960;&#8208;allylic enolate complex with the iridium catalyst.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208; and Quarterpyridine&#8208;Based Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based vinylene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs are synthesized, which exhibit considerably high light&#8208;visible catalytic efficiency with the H2O2 production rate (HPR) is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water and O2 atmosphere. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The revealed structure&#8211;property relationship presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
This paper presents multipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely defined position and number of pyridinium cationic groups. Specifically, three terpyridine&#8208; and quarterpyridine&#8208;based trialdehydes were synthesized, and utilized as the starting monomers to polymerize with trimethylpyridinium bromide to yield vinylene&#8208;linked iTPy&#8208;COF, iTPPy&#8208;COF and iQPPy&#8208;COF, respectively. Thus constructed donor&#8208;acceptor cationic COFs exhibit considerably high light&#8208;visible catalytic efficiency for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis by the dual&#8208;channel mechanisms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). In pure water and O2 atmosphere, the H2O2 production rate (HPR) of iTPPy&#8208;COF after 1&#8197;h reaction is as high as 7955&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Even though in air, its HPR value still reaches 6249&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Moreover, it is found that changing the arm lengths and ratios of pyridine to benzene ring in the frameworks significantly affects the photocatalytic capability. The structure&#8211;property relationship is investigated in terms of the variations of electronic structures through the theoretical simulations and measurements of photophysical parameters such as fluorescence lifetimes, photocurrent intensities, and impedances of charge transfer, which presents new insights into the engineering of multipyridine&#8208;based cationic COFs for highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Controlled Internal Electric Field in MOF/COF Heterojunction Towards Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently connected NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti)/TpBpy&#8208;COF heterojunction with a strong internal electric field was constructed to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting performance. The results show that the co&#8208;exposure of the (001) and (111) crystal faces in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) forms the strongest internal electric field with TpBpy&#8208;COF, promoting the effective separation of photogenerated charges in the S&#8208;scheme path.







Abstract
Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H2 and O2 evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF&#8208;based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S&#8208;scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.

&lt;p&gt;Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) and TpBpy-COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) and TpBpy-COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF-based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S-scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two isoindigo&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG) were synthesized using a microwave&#8208;assisted method. By modulating core planarity, distinct morphological variations were achieved, with the highly crystalline, planar sheet&#8208;like I&#8208;TTA material standing out. This material exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting (OER and HER) reactions with low overpotential and promotes the potential of COFs in sustainable energy applications.







Abstract
Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG (I=Isoindigo, TTA=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)&#8208;trianiline, TG=triamino&#8208;guanidinium hydrochloride salt). By introducing two amine core units with different planarity, such as triazine and ionic guanidinium units, we control the morphology, crystallinity, and corresponding electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar two dimensional (2D) nanosheets covalent organic framework (COF), I&#8208;TTA whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (COP), I&#8208;TG with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134&#8197;mV for HER (in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4) and ~283&#8197;mV for OER (in 1&#8197;M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24&#8197;hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

         <title>3D Cluster&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COFs, utilizing multicore Cu clusters with specific stereochemical configurations as building blocks, were first synthesized through a stepwise assembly strategy. In comparison to isolated Cu4 clusters, the well&#8208;ordered porous framework structure of Cu4COFs exhibits a narrower band gap, enhanced structural integrity, and more efficient charge transfer characteristics. These features endow Cu4COFs with greatly enhanced performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Copper clusters exhibit superior catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and their defined structures endow them with unique advantages for modeling the catalytic mechanism at the atomic level. Additionally, the construction of highly stable and regularly structured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on copper clusters still presents significant challenges. Herein, we reported two highly stable and reactive cluster&#8208;based COFs (termed Cu4COF&#8208;1 and Cu4COF&#8208;2) constructed via a stepwise assembly strategy. The epitaxially amino&#8208;modified Cu4 cluster (Cu4&#8208;NH2) was initially synthesized based on coordination bonds. Then, Cu4COFs were obtained by the covalent linkage of Cu4&#8208;NH2 clusters and organic linkers. Compared with isolated Cu4 clusters, the Cu4COFs exhibit greater stability, a narrower band gap, a larger specific surface area, and better charge transfer ability, which endow them with superior photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the covalently linked Cu4COFs could efficiently lower the energy barrier for the formation of the critical *COOH intermediate, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This study offers a solid basis for the atomically precise construction of novel metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based COF catalysts.

         <title>Renewable Terephthalates and Aromatic Diisocyanates from Galactose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates is presented using a transition metal&#8208;free route through a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization on gram scale. Terephthalates were readily converted into aromatic diisocyanates in flow and used to synthesize 100&#8201;% renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes.







Abstract
Aromatic diisocyanates, invaluable commodity chemicals for polymer manufacturing, are produced annually on megaton scales from petroleum&#8208;derived diamines via phosgenation. Existing routes toward renewable alternatives are sparse and limited by access to functionalized aromatic starting materials, such as terephthalates. Herein, we report the development of a robust route to renewable terephthalates and aromatic diisocyanates from D&#8208;galactose via Eastwood olefination and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, followed by a mild electrochemical decarboxylative aromatization. This process was developed and applied on gram&#8208;scale to synthesize terephthalates, which were transformed into aromatic diisocyanates via Curtius rearrangement in flow. We demonstrate gram&#8208;scale preparation of 1,4&#8208;phenylene diisocyanate and 2,5&#8208;toluene diisocyanate and formulation of these monomers to prepare fully renewable thermoplastic polyurethanes. Preparation of these renewable aromatic diisocyanates proceeds without the use of high&#8208;pressure gases or costly transition&#8208;metals and represents a novel route to fully renewable aromatic diisocyanates.

         <title>Expanding Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam (PoTeM) Core Structure Diversity by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis and Bioengineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) derive from ornithine&#8208;based lysobacterene A. To expand the PoTeM core structure carbon skeleton by a CH2&#8208;unit, a synthetic access to lysobacterene A and an extended analog was developed, and cyclization by cognate ikarugamycin cyclases IkaBC was achieved in vitro. Building on these results, the adenylation domain of the NRPS IkaA was programmed to directly incorporate l&#8208;lysine, giving biotechnological access to the first backbone&#8208;engineered PoTeM, homo&#8208;ikarugamycin.







Abstract
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) represent a growing class of bioactive natural products that are derived from a common tetramate polyene precursor, lysobacterene A, produced by an unusual bacterial iterative polyketide synthase (PKS)/non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway&#8208;specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton do currently not exist. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural l&#8208;ornithine&#8208;derived building block by l&#8208;lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo&#8208;ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept l&#8208;lysine, which upon co&#8208;expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo&#8208;ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.

We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine, which upon co-expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo-ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically&#8208;Stretchable Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Electron Acceptors with Flexible Linkers</title>

By novel molecular design, a dimerized acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) was synthesized. DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based rigid devices render an efficiency of 18.75&#8201;% and crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. A polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL) was prepared via polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. Compared to DY&#8208;FBrL, PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based rigid devices display a higher COS of 23.45&#8201;% but a lower efficiency of 14.13&#8201;%. Importantly, intrinsically&#8208;stretchable devices based on DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL exhibit excellent device stretchability.







Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are emerging as promising candidates for powering next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, developing molecular design strategies to achieve both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach by synthesizing a dimerized electron acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) that enables rigid OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.75&#8201;% and a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. The enhanced PCE and stretchability of DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based devices are attributed to its extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and elongated side chains. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL), synthesized via the polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. While PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices exhibit a slightly lower PCE of 14.13&#8201;%, they achieve a significantly higher COS of 23.45&#8201;%, representing one of the highest PCEs reported for polymerized acceptors containing only flexible linkers. Consequently, IS&#8208;OSCs fabricated using DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL achieve notable PCEs of 14.31&#8201;% and 11.61&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, the device stretchability improves progressively from Y6 (strain at PCE80%=11&#8201;%), to DY&#8208;FBrL (strain at PCE80%=23&#8201;%), and PDY&#8208;FL (strain at PCE80%=31&#8201;%). This study presents a promising molecular design strategy for tailoring electron acceptor structures, offering a new pathway to develop high&#8208;performance IS&#8208;OSCs with enhanced mechanical properties.

         <title>All&#8208;alkynyl Protected Rod&#8208;Shaped Au9(AgCu)126 Nanocluster with Remarkable Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of large&#8208;size alloy nanoclusters (~2 nm) is still challenging. An all&#8208;alkynyl protected [Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#8801;C)68(BF4)]4+ (x=0 ~ 20) (1) trimetallic nanocluster has been synthesized and structure determined by SCXRD. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28 protected by 68 PhC&#8801;C ligands with 15 distinct alkynyl&#8211;metal binding configurations. Theoretic calculation reveals that the 1 features a HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 0.29 eV. This suggests that 1 is situated at the boundary of the transition from a molecular to a metallic state. Remarkably, compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibit significantly enhanced photothermal conversion capability. A substantial temperature rise of ~ 51.5 &#176;C within 5 min (&#955;ex = 660 nm, 0.5 W/cm2) and a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 84.7% at 12 &#956;M in N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were observed.Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption(TA)&#160;spectroscopy reveals that the electron&#8208;phonon coupling&#160;(&#964;e&#8208;ph) of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1, when employed as a photothermal material, shows promise in biothermal therapy, photothermal catalysis, and photothermal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;, Au(II)&#8208;, Au(III)&#8208;Fluoride Complexes: Synthesis and Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III) are summarised. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several developments of these complexes with a range of supporting ligands, which has enabled their reactivity to be studied. Herein, these advances are highlighted, organised by the oxidation state of Au and supporting ligand.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III), up to and including 2024, are reviewed herein. Despite the flourishing field of gold catalysis, these complexes had long been elusive due to their instability. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several reports of these complexes in recent years. The use of a variety of supporting ligands have facilitated access to these complexes, which has allowed their reactivity to be further studied and understood, thereby laying the ground for future reaction development. This review highlights these advances, organised by the formal oxidation state of the gold centre and the supporting ligand.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;CO2 Battery at Elevated Temperatures: Advances with Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne and Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with high stability at elevated temperatures were assembled using fluorine&#8208;graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvent. At temperature of 80&#8201;&#176;C, the batteries could operate at high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 and stably run for 240 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1, the corresponding pouch cell showed high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries demonstrate promising prospects in terms of high&#8208;density energy storage and efficient CO2 fixation. However, their practical application is impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics and leakage of volatile and flammable organic electrolytes, especially for high temperature application scenarios, leading to large polarization and limited cycling stability. Herein, we fabricate a highly rechargeable and stable Li&#8208;CO2 battery with high temperature adaptability by employing fluorine&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvents. The employed FGDY, which possesses homogeneous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon, high specific surface area, and uniform pores, significantly enhances the battery reaction kinetics. Consequently, the fabricated Li&#8208;CO2 batteries operate consistently at a large current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C while showcasing high discharge capacity of 29050&#8197;mAh&#8901;g&#8722;1 along with excellent cycling stability. As proof of concept, Li&#8208;CO2 pouch cells achieve a high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the device, and show outstanding cycling stability at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This study underscores the effectiveness of graphdiyne&#8208;derived carbon catalysts in achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <dc:description>
This study develops new photoinitiators (PIs) for photopolymerization, combining high efficiency, low toxicity, and compatibility with 3D printing. The C5 compound, designed via molecular modeling, outperforms commercial PIs, improving initiation by 40&#8211;132&#8201;% under LED and sunlight. Its efficiency, photochemical mechanism, and low toxicity are experimentally confirmed.







Abstract
The development of photoinitiators (PIs) combining high initiation ability, low&#8208;toxicity, and availability for high&#8208;precision 3D printing is a key challenge and an urgent problem to be solved nowadays in photopolymerization. In this study, carbazole chalcone glyoxylate oxime ester derivatives (denoted as Cs, C1&#8722;C5) containing both glyoxylate and oxime ester moieties with good light absorption properties in the visible range have been designed as type I PIs for the free radical photopolymerization (FRP) of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) under 405&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) as well as sunlight irradiation. The reaction properties and mechanism of Cs are firstly predicted by molecular modeling/molecular design, which anticipate that C5 could exhibit the best photoinitiation ability, this structure being more prone to decarboxylation. Subsequent experimental results clearly show that the photoinitiation ability of C5 outperforms that of the benchmark commercial PIs (methyl benzoylformate (MBF), diphenyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO)), and phenylbis (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;phosphine oxide (BAPO) under the same conditions. Compared to TPO, the photoinitiation ability of C5 improved by 40&#8201;%, 132&#8201;%, and 47&#8201;% exposed to LED@405&#8197;nm, LED@450&#8197;nm, and sunlight. In addition, C5 is successfully applied to 3D printing for the manufacture of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution object. The photochemical mechanism of C5 is systematically and comprehensively analyzed using a combination of steady state photolysis, decarboxylation reaction, fluorescence experiments, and electron spin resonance&#8208;spin trapping (ESR&#8208;ST) technology. It is found that both glyoxylate and oxime ester in C5 are highly active and capable of undergoing decarboxylation reactions to produce CO2 and free radicals, which is consistent with the results predicted by molecular modeling. Furthermore, the low&#8208;toxicity of C5 is evidenced by cytotoxicity assays. The comprehensive molecular modeling and experimental approach adopted in this research has led to the development of novel PIs that are highly efficient and low&#8208;toxic, and can be used for high&#8208;precision 3D printing, which offers broad application prospects in the fields of environmental sustainability, visible light curing, and biomedical science.

&lt;p&gt;The development of photoinitiators (PIs) combining high initiation ability, low-toxicity, and availability for high-precision 3D printing is a key challenge and an urgent problem to be solved nowadays in photopolymerization.

         <title>Copper(I) Halide Complex Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Aggregate Induced Emission for Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) halide complex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging performance, which is resulted from the joint effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption of the heavy Cu2I2 core, high exciton utilization efficiency facilitated by the fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and the effective suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions in solid state.







Abstract
Developing solution&#8208;processable and stable scintillators with high light yields, low detection limits and high imaging resolutions holds great significance for flexible X&#8208;ray imaging. However, attaining an optimal equilibrium among X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, exciton utilization efficiency, and decay lifetime of scintillators remains a substantial challenge. Here, a new Cu(I) halide complex was synthesized in a mild condition. It exhibits intense blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristic, as well as good water&#8208;oxygen stability and photochemical stability. Notably, the complex shows excellent radiation resistance and efficient radioluminescence (RL) with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 42.5&#8197;nGyairs&#8722;1. This superior scintillation performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of effective X&#8208;ray absorption by the heavy Cu2I2 core, the high radiation&#8208;induced exciton utilization rate in TADF process, and the remarkable suppression of non&#8208;radiative transitions by the restriction of intramolecular motions in solid state. Furthermore, the favourable solution processability of the complex facilitates the successful fabrication of a flexible film, achieving high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with a resolution of 17.3&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of hybrid Cu(I) halides with AIE&#8208;TADF effects for high&#8208;energy radiation detection and imaging, opening up new avenues for the exploration of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance scintillators.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalysts Derived from Water&#8208;Induced Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Aerogel for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast transformation process and underlying formation mechanism of water&#8208;induced pure metal&#8211;organic framework aerogels are demonstrated. The derived edge&#8208;enriched oxygen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nickel sites anchored on the defective carbon belts (a&#8208;Ni/DCBs) display excellent catalytic activity and durability toward electrochemical water oxidation, resulting from the optimized electronic structure and reduced thermodynamic energy barrier.







Abstract
Research on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) aerogels is relatively scarce, primarily constrained by the limited availability of synthetic methods. Herein, a water&#8208;induced rapid conversion process of MOF powder to MOF aerogel is demonstrated, where the macroscopic transition is essentially due to the reassembly of microscopic constituent units and the rapid alteration of morphological structure. The derived catalyst possesses abundant holes left by the acid leaching process, leading to the high enrichment of O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites on the concomitant carbon edges. Consequently, such a catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, only requiring a low overpotential of 279&#8197;mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the reduced OER energy barrier over the edge&#8208;enriched O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites, as compared with internal O&#8208;coordinated sites and traditional N&#8208;coordinated sites. This is primarily attributed to the optimization effect of distinctive O&#8208;coordinated structure and synergistic edge effect on the electronic structure of active Ni centers.

         <title>Direct CO2 Activation and Conversion to Ethanol via Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to activate and convert CO2 in dissolved as well as gaseous form via reactive oxygen species was established. Within only 5&#8197;h reaction time at atmospheric conditions, room temperature a conversion efficiency of 92&#8201;% from CO2 to 12.2&#8197;mmol/L ethanol was achieved. Direct Air Capture experiments gave similar results, which showcases both the inherent flexibility of this method as well as its efficiency.







Abstract
The growing demand for energy and the excessive use of fossil fuels represents one of the main challenges for humanity. Storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuels or value&#8208;added chemicals without creating additional environmental burdens is a key requirement for a sustainable future. Here we use biomimetic artificial photosynthesis and present a dPCN&#8208;224(H) MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic system, which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate and convert CO2 to ethanol under atmospheric conditions, at room temperature and in 2&#8211;5&#8197;h reaction time. The system provides a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion efficiency (CTE) of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, this method also allows the conversion of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC), making it a rapid and versatile method for both dissolved and gaseous CO2.

         <title>Chemical Energy Lights Up Europium&#8208;Based Ultra&#8208;bright Afterglow for Bioanalysis Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photochemical afterglow system was constructed through structural design and coordination, lighting up the weak&#8208;emissive fluorophore in the form of afterglow through chemiexcitation. Ultimately, a system with a highest reported afterglow luminescence QY of 27.5&#8201;% was accomplished and successfully applied in high SBR in vivo bioimaging and highly sensitive in vitro diagnostic of SAA through lateral flow immunoassay. Ab: antibody; AG: afterglow; PS: polystyrene; QY: quantum yield; SBR: signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio; SAA: serum amyloid A.







Abstract
Photochemical afterglow materials are gaining great attention for the property to continuously emit light after the excitation source is removed. However, their limited luminescence quantum yield (QY) and brightness hinder the use in biological applications. In this study, we introduce a novel photochemical afterglow system that combines a newly designed photoenergy cache unit (PCU) with an emitter through coordination covalent bonds. The PCU boasts a dark state to significantly emit photons only through chemiexcitation in the process of photochemical reactions, facilitating direct energy transfer to the emitter and resulting in bright afterglow. The related mechanisms further guided us to achieve the highest reported afterglow luminescence quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;%. The system can be encapsulated and dispersed in aqueous solutions for in vivo bioimaging in living mice under mild and simple conditions (low concentration, low excitation power, short excitation time, short exposure time), and also for in vitro diagnostic through lateral flow immunoassay, enabling the highly sensitive detection of the inflammatory biomarker serum amyloid A (SAA) and demonstrating excellent correlation with clinical test results. This study offers new insights into enhancing luminescence QY and brightness of afterglow, highlighting the potential of such systems for further biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A novel photochemical afterglow system was constructed through structural design and coordination, lighting up the weak-emissive fluorophore in the form of afterglow through chemiexcitation. Ultimately, a system with a highest reported afterglow luminescence QY of 27.5&#8201;% was accomplished and successfully applied in high SBR in vivo bioimaging and highly sensitive in vitro diagnostic of SAA through lateral flow immunoassay. Ab: antibody; AG: afterglow; PS: polystyrene; QY: quantum yield; SBR: signal-to-background ratio; SAA: serum amyloid A.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview introduces the scintillation mechanism and synthesis methods of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) scintillators, and emphatically summarizes the research progress in fabrication strategies of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging.







Abstract
Scintillators play a pivotal role in multiple fields such as medical imaging, radioactive contaminant detection, non&#8208;destructive testing, high&#8208;energy physics and homeland security. However, the traditional inorganic scintillators are faced with the shortcomings of high fabrication cost and low light yield. In recent years, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have become the promising alternatives for their excellent luminescence properties, favorable air and irradiation stability, and low&#8208;cost preparation. Among them, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) have attracted wide attention due to their particular flexible molecular structure design, easy synthesis and low toxicity. This minireview summarizes the latest progress in high performance Mn2+&#8208;Based scintillation screens. Herein, the scintillation mechanism of OIMnHs scintillators is firstly discussed. Then, the different synthesis methods of OIMnHs scintillators are briefly described, including solvent diffusion, cooling crystallization, evaporative crystallization and solid&#8208;state mechanochemical synthesis. After that, the recent strategies of OIMnHs for forming scintillation screens applying to X&#8208;ray imaging are emphatically reviewed, which are growing large single crystals, fabricating to glass or ceramic and blending with polymers. The fabrication progress and applications of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens were introduced and the structure&#8211;property relationship of these screens was discussed. Finally, the challenges of this new scintillator material are summarized, and the potential research directions for future exploration are proposed.

         <title>Robust Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles via Ethynyl Bonding for High&#8208;Fidelity Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, rapid and user&#8208;friendly strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates via stable Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bonds was developed, which showed better resistance to biothiols than Au&#8722;S conjugates, enhancing detection signal fidelity and reliability in cell imaging, especially in complex physiological environments. This strategy addresses the longstanding issue of stability towards biothiols, thereby making it a valuable tool for a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
While Au&#8722;S bonds have been widely applied in preparing gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugates for biosensing, cell imaging, and biomedical research, biothiols in complex biological environments can seriously interfere with the stability of the conjugates due to ligand exchange. Herein, we communicate a robust and fast strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;functionalized AuNP conjugates (PFCs) using the Au&#8722;C&#8801;C bond, which can be completed within two minutes. The resulting Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs exhibited better stability and resistance to biothiols than the corresponding Au&#8722;S PFCs, and also demonstrated excellent stability in high salt concentration, a wide range of pH values, and varying temperatures. The mechanism of Au&#8722;C&#8801;C conjugation was confirmed using molecular dynamics simulation and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Au&#8722;C&#8801;C PFCs significantly improved the signal fidelity in an intracellular caspase imaging assay. Overall, the developed strategy provides a promising approach for constructing AuNP nanoprobes, allowing reliable detection and broadening the potential for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Direct Observation of Electron Donation onto the Reactants and a Transient Poisoning Mechanism During CO2 Electroreduction on Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ techniques reveal key insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Ni single atom catalysts. Through poisoning studies, we reveal that the reduction of the system does not result in a metal&#8208;based reduction, rather it is associated with donation of electrons onto a combination of the support and the reactants. We demonstrate the suitability of these catalysts for application to CO2 waste streams which have unavoidable impurities.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are an important class of materials that mediate chemical reduction reactions, a key subset of which is Ni within a carbon support for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, how the metal atom/clusters and the carbon&#8208;based support act in concert to catalyze CO2RR is not well understood, with most reports attributing activity solely to the Ni&#8208;Nx/C moieties. To address this gap, we have undertaken a mechanistic investigation, employing in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled with electrochemical studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to further understand how Ni single atoms work in conjunction with the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix to promote CO2RR to CO, and how the presence of impurities such as those present in CO2&#8208;containing waste flue gases (including NOx, and CN&#8722;) changes the catalyst upon reduction. In contrast to previous works, we do not find strong evidence for a purely metal&#8208;based reduction upon application of negative reductive potentials. Instead, we present evidence for an increase in the equatorial vs. axial splitting of Ni, consistent with electrons moving onto the reactants via the Ni single atom 3dz2 orbital. In addition, we demonstrate a transient poisoning mechanism of the Ni SAC by nitrite and thiocyanate, explaining the recovery of activity during CO2RR. These insights can aid the design of practical CO2 valorization technologies.

         <title>Charge Polarization Boosting Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Reduction of CO2 and Nitrite in Dilute Concentrations with a Unity Carbon Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual site catalyst Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C with single Fe atom and Cu NPs on N&#8208;doped carbon to enhance the coupling of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N) for urea synthesis. The Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high FEurea of 50.05&#8201;% with a flow cell at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized.







Abstract
Synthesis of urea through electrocatalytic coupling reaction of CO2 with nitrite (NO2&#8722;) represents a sustainable means to substitute the conventional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthetic protocol. The direct conversion of dilute NO2&#8722; in real wastewaters to urea with high efficiency is still a significant challenge, as C&#8208;intermediates tend to go through an extensive reduction achieving mostly C&#8208;containing productions due to the lack of N&#8208;intermediates, originating from slow diffusion rate of NO2&#8722;. Herein, we report the charge&#8208;polarized Fe&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Cu&#948;+ dual sites in metal/carbon heterojunction material (Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and dilute NO2&#8722; solution (100&#8197;ppm NO2&#8722;&#8208;N). The electron&#8208;rich single Fe atoms dispersed N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) restrain *CO desorption, and the electron&#8208;deficient Cu nanoparticles (Cu) promote the deep reduction of NO2&#8722; to *NH2. As a result, the obtained Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for urea of 50.05&#8201;% with a yield of 850.57&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in a flow cell. Moreover, Curea&#8208;selectivity reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near&#8208;unity selectivity for the value&#8208;added urea and NH3 is realized. The present results provide a valuable reference for the design of new catalysts for efficient synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds in dilute NO2&#8722; solution.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) represents a sustainable means to substitute the conventional energy-intensive urea synthetic protocol. The direct conversion of dilute NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in real wastewaters to urea with high efficiency is still a significant challenge, as C-intermediates tend to go through an extensive reduction achieving mostly C-containing productions due to the lack of N-intermediates, originating from slow diffusion rate of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Herein, we report the charge-polarized Fe&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; dual sites in metal/carbon heterojunction material (Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) for co-reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dilute NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; solution (100&#8197;ppm NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-N). The electron-rich single Fe atoms dispersed N-doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) restrain *CO desorption, and the electron-deficient Cu nanoparticles (Cu) promote the deep reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the obtained Cu@Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for urea of 50.05&#8201;% with a yield of 850.57&#8197;mg&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.35&#8197;V (&lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE) in a flow cell. Moreover, C&lt;sub&gt;urea-selectivity&lt;/sub&gt; reaches to 100&#8201;% and a near-unity selectivity for the value-added urea and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is realized. The present results provide a valuable reference for the design of new catalysts for efficient synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds in dilute NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced Inversion and Amplification of Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) in Supramolecular Assemblies of Axially Chiral Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented control of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated fluorescent enantiomers is achieved through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The naphthalene monoimide (NMI) fluorophores (R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI), each equipped with two pyridyl functionalities, show solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and enhanced chiroptical properties through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Co&#8208;assemblies with chiral diacids (D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids) produce hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical structures, resulting in inversion and amplification of CD and CPL properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly and chiroptical properties of two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminogens, R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI, each equipped with two pyridyl moieties for hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding with chiral diacids. The two enantiomers display aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and increased CD and CPL signals in the self&#8208;assembled state with a high glum value of 1.5 (&#177;0.06)&#215;10&#8722;2 in 1:9 dioxane:methylcyclohexane. Crystallographic analysis confirmed mirror&#8208;image helical structures for R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, leading to elongated hexagonal platelets. Supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of R&#8208;NMI with D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids (D&#8208;TA and L&#8208;TA) could remarkably modulate and invert the chiroptical properties of R&#8208;NMI, which is unachievable with control chiral monoacids. The co&#8208;assembled structures were driven by pyridine&#8208;carboxylic acid H&#8208;bonding as revealed from the crystal structure analysis, which was also supported by computational studies. Strikingly, R&#8208;NMI+D&#8208;TA leads to an exceptionally high fourfold amplification in the glum value [5.4 (&#177;0.04)&#215;10&#8722;2] with an inverted sign, which additionally demonstrates intriguing temperature&#8208;dependent switching. In contrast, R&#8208;NMI+L&#8208;TA results in a threefold reduction in the glum value [0.54 (&#177;0.015)&#215;10&#8722;3], also with an inverted sign compared to R&#8208;NMI alone, establishing a clear strategy for chiral discrimination between the two enantiomers of TA.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Agent for Synergistic Tumor Therapy: Co&#8208;Activation of Photochemical&#8208;Biological Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic composite nanotherapeutic agent (HAP@BMPns) was developed for synergistic tumor therapy. HAP@BMPns is triggered by the acidic tumor environment to release the photosensitizer BMP and Ca2+, thereby synergistically activating photochemical&#8208;biological effects through the production of O2&#8722;&#8901; based Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions and mitochondrial damage caused by Ca2+ overload, ultimately achieving a synergistic effect for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;mode photodynamic therapy (PDT) based on photochemical reactions is limited by the tumor microenvironment, which reduces the ablation efficiency for solid tumors. Making it vital to seek ways to improve the tumor therapeutic effect. Based on this, we propose a dual&#8208;mode intelligent nanotherapeutic system (HAP@BMPns) based on photochemical&#8208;biological effects. HAP@BMPns is composed of an acid&#8208;responsive high&#8208;calcium biomimetic nanomaterial (HAP) and photosensitizer (BMP), which can spontaneously activate photochemical (Type&#8208;I PDT) and biological effects for synergistic cancer therapy. HAP@BMPns breaks down upon entering tumor cells under acidic conditions, releasing a large amount of Ca2+ and BMP. Triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, which induces mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis. Synchronously, Type&#8208;I PDT of BMP under two&#8208;photon (800&#8197;nm) laser irradiation becomes activated, resulting in enhanced destruction of tumor cells by the photochemical effect. Cell studies have indicated that HAP@BMPns (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) exhibits a strong inhibitory efficiency on tumor cells growth, with low (22.4&#8201;%) survival rate. However, the individual components, i.&#8201;e. BMP (5.0&#8197;&#956;M) and HAP (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) display low inhibitory efficiency with high survival rates (55.9&#8201;% and 63.0&#8201;% respectively). Therefore, this dual&#8208;mode synergistic treatment strategy using acid&#8208;triggered photochemical&#8208;biological effects significantly enhances the ablation of solid tumors, realizing the synergistic effect. We hope that this design strategy can provide guidance for the design and development of a tumor therapeutic platform.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Spillover Promotes Stable Synthesis of Vinyl Chloride on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric O/N co&#8208;doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized by a sequential oxygen etching strategy to overcome the over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during acetylene hydrochlorination. This single&#8208;atom Ru thus induced an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover based on the electrostatic potential difference, which resulted in enhanced kinetics to proceed the reaction via Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier.







Abstract
Ru single&#8208;atom catalysts hold great promise for the robust synthesis of vinyl chloride through acetylene hydrochlorination. However, the easy over&#8208;chlorination of Ru atoms during reaction suppress the catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we have synthesized an oxygen doped Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst by a sequential oxygen etching strategy, which delivers the remarkable yield of vinyl chloride monomer (&gt;99.38&#8201;%) and stability (&gt;900&#8197;h, 180&#8197;h&#8722;1), far beyond those reported Ru counterparts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric structure of single&#8208;atom Ru promotes an unconventional oxygen&#8208;mediated hydrogen spillover after the activation of hydrogen chloride, which enables the reaction to proceed through Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism with a reduced energy barrier of acetylene hydrochlorination compared to the traditional Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway. As a result, the enhanced reaction kinetics further restrict over&#8208;chlorination of single&#8208;atom Ru, thereby ensuring the excellent durability. This work offers a strategy for designing multifunctional catalysts with enhanced performances for acetylene hydrochlorination.

         <title>Trap&#8208;Enabled Long Exciton Lifetime in Low&#8208;Toxicity Quantum Dots for Enhanced Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prolonging exciton lifetime in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is crucial to their photochemical applications. Previously, this was achieved through a mechanism called thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) for QDs surface&#8208;anchored with molecular triplet energy acceptors, in which the molecular triplets sensitized by QDs can repopulate QD&#8208;excitons through thermally activated reverse energy transfer. Here we demonstrate a novel TADPL mechanism achieved by engineering the surface trap states of QDs. Rapid exciton trapping and thermally activated slow detrapping prolong the exciton lifetime of low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based QDs from the timescale of ~10 ns to ~100 &#956;s. Such a long exciton lifetime allows direct engagement of QDs in diffusion&#8208;assisted energy transfer, without needing surface&#8208;anchored molecules as triplet transmitters, for solution&#8208;phase photochemical applications such as photon upconversion and [2+2] cycloaddition. This advantage not only greatly streamlines the design of QD&#8208;based photochemical systems but also avoids the reliability issue associated with the anchoring between QDs and molecules, as well as enabling facile tuning of the TADPL wavelength range not limited by the availability of molecular triplet acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Compensating K Ions through an Organic Salt in Electrolytes for Practical K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>K&#8208;ion batteries face significant challenges due to a severe shortage of active K ions, with cathode materials typically containing less than 70% K ions and first&#8208;cycle irreversible reactions consuming up to 20% more. Conventional K&#8208;ion compensation methods fail to supply sufficient K ions without compromising cell integrity. To address this, we introduce potassium sulfocyanate (KSCN) as an electrolyte additive capable of delivering up to 100% active K ions. During initial charging, KSCN undergoes oxidative decomposition at 3.6 V, releasing active K ions and forming the cosolvent thiocyanogen ((SCN)2). This molecule, meeting diverse electrochemical properties, was identified using unsupervised machine learning and cheminformatics. The approach demonstrated full KSCN conversion and excellent compatibility with all cell components. The presence of (SCN)2 cosolvent enhanced the rate capability of anodes by promoting K&#8208;ion desolvation. In a hard carbon|K0.5Mg0.15[Mn0.8Mg0.05]O2 pouch cell, this approach tripled the capacity through supplying 58% active K ions, showcasing a practical solution for active K&#8208;ion compensation in K&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Adsorption at the Inner&#8208;Helmholtz Plane Directs Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (CEI) on cathode surface constitutes the foundation of realizing high&#8208;voltag&#173;e Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet its formation, a highly heterogeneous process involving irreversible reactions between electrolyte components and cathode materials, remains poorly understood. Herein, combining multiple in&#8208;situ/operando interfacial characterization techniques, we establish the correlation between interfacial structure and interphasial chemistry, and reveal the key role played by adsorptive behavior of various electrolyte components in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane during CEI formation. Quartz crystal microbalance equipped with dissipation modification detects that difluorooxalatoborate (DFOB&#8208;) anion preferentially adsorbed on LiCoO2 tends to expel carbonate solvents from the adsorption layer, thus suppressing their electrochemical decomposition at high voltages and leading to a more compact CEI derived from anions with limited contribution from organic ingredients. Consequently, the CoO2 lattice structure protected by the dense CEI remains intact despite near&#8208;complete delithiation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability for 4.7 V operation of LiCoO2 cathode. The atomistic&#8208;level insight into the key factors that govern CEI formation provides directive knowledge that accelerates electrolyte design for high&#8208;voltage batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine&#8594;borane Functionalized Pyrenes and Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with N&#8594;B Lewis pairs, so called borylative fusion, has recently emerged as a simple and powerful mean to modulate their electronic and photophysical properties thanks to extension of the p system. Herein, we considered a new class of PAHs appended with phosphine&#8594;borane Lewis pairs and investigated pyrene as well as anthracene derivatives. In these compounds, strong P&#8594;B interactions are enforced geometrically, but the p&#8208;system is not extended. Nevertheless, such P&#8594;B functionalization was found to significantly impact the optical and electrochemical properties. The P,B&#8208;functionalized PAHs display noticeably reduced HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps and enhanced fluorescence. Both the number and position of P&#8594;B units turned to play a significant role.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Mechanistic Control of Nonadiabatic Tunnelling in Triplet Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Experiments on three chemically similar triplet carbenes observed the reaction of one at 10 K, another only when heated to 65 K, whereas the third remained stable despite heating. As the products are singlets, it is clear that the reactions involve intersystem crossing in addition to intramolecular hydrogen transfer. Here, instanton theory is used to study various possible reaction mechanisms, including sequential&#160;and concerted&#160;pathways.&#160;The latter describes a new reaction mechanism which involves changing spin state (a nonadiabatic process) while heavy atoms tunnel underneath a barrier (an adiabatic process). In each case, we find that the concerted pathway dominates the rate at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures it switches to a sequential mechanism. The existence of a crossover temperature is the key to explaining the experimental observations and demonstrates that temperature can control the reactivity of triplet carbenes via nonadiabatic tunnelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8208;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8208;3 S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100 hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90 nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCsis&#160;influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar [5] arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8208;). The higher permeability of Ch+&#160;channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+&#160;and Ch&#8208;&#160;channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8208; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8208;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8208; group in Ch&#8208;&#160;channels. K+&#160;ions concentrated around the COO&#8208;&#160;groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8208;&#160;ions around the NH3+&#160;groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing functional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5 &#215; 10&#8208;2 to 1.3 &#215; 10&#8208;1 S cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH MOFs with built&#8208;in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity&#8208;dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH3 and NO2 using a low driving voltage of 0.1 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts Enabling Efficient Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Blue&#8208;Emitting Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials are a class of highly efficient and stable host materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), composed solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Despite recent great advancements in PHC research, their applications are still mainly limited to phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs). Thus, expanding PHC materials into other types of OLEDs is critical for advancing organic electronics. In this study, we designed a series of&#160;high&#8208;triplet PHC materials based on a multi&#8208;substitution approach of the 9,9'&#8208;spirobifluorene (SBF) backbone and used them, for the first time, as host in blue&#8208;emitting phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) OLEDs. Devices based on 2,6&#8208;Bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)boron (DtBuCzB) emitter, using FIrpic or fac&#8208;Ir(tpz)3 as the sensitizer, achieved high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values ranging from 29.1% to 33.9%. Additionally, blue MR&#8208;TADF OLED devices based on v&#8208;DABNA with a phosphorescent sensitizer (CN&#8208;Ir), demonstrated outstanding electroluminescent performance, with EQEmax of approximately 31% notably due to an excellent molecular orientation induced by the PHC hosts. All devices exhibited narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum spectra and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. This study marks the first application of PHC hosts in phosphorescence&#8208;sensitized MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation of blue OLEDs</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Strained Electron&#8208;Rich Molecular Bowl and Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing two pyrrole rings at the armchair edges of perylene creates the small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl&#160;1, which can be viewed as a nitrogen&#8208;doped end&#8208;cap of C70. Despite numerous attempts since 2008, its synthesis has been hindered by strain and synthetic challenges. In this study, we present the synthesis and property analysis of molecular bowl&#160;1&#160;and its dimer, the wavy&#8208;shaped nanographene&#160;2. Substituents on nitrogen atoms significantly affect the bowl depth, intermolecular interactions, and supramolecular behaviors. Consequently, the butyl&#8208;substituted molecular bowl&#160;1a&#160;forms unusual polar crystals with all bowls oriented similarly, suggesting potential pyroelectric or ferroelectric applications.&#160;Due to the electron&#8208;rich nature, compounds&#160;1&#160;exhibit significantly strong binding affinity towards fullerene, with&#160;1a&#160;forming a sandwich structure with C70. Furthermore, neutral bowls&#160;1&#160;display counter&#8208;rotating ring currents similar to corannulene, while their dications exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The wavy&#8208;structured nanographene&#160;2&#160;demonstrates two continuously reversible oxidation processes, and its dication&#160;22+&#160;shows remarkably high stability under ambient conditions.&#160;In summary, this work constructs a small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl and its nanographene dimer, highlighting their exceptional properties, promising applications, and potential as foundations for future advanced nanostructure fabrication.</dc:description>

         <title>Broadband&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition and Thermoinduced Cycloreversion&#8208;Powered Dynamic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion of pyrenylvinylpyrylium salt elicit bending of its crystals by exposure to visible light and straightening by heating. This example represents a novel concept of energy conversion where the energy stored in the bonds of the strained cyclobutane ring is converted to work of dynamic molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanically responsive dynamic molecular crystals are central to developing efficient, rapid, and robust materials capable of conversion of light energy to mechanical work. However, unlike some other, mainly photochromic molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems, solids that undergo photoinduced [2+2] cycloaddition have not been thoroughly explored for powering reversible actuation, despite that this reaction system carries potential in the heavily strained bonds of the cyclobutane ring. In this study, we propose that broadband&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition can be used to store energy and actuate dynamic organic crystals by irradiation with visible light. The prototypical material, pyrenylvinylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (1&#8211;PVPyL), undergoes a topochemical [2+2] cycloaddition induced not only by ultraviolet radiation (365&#8197;nm) but also by monochromatic green light (532&#8197;nm), red light (620&#8197;nm) and broadband visible light in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) manner, causing its crystals to bend. The crystals effectively act as energy depots, where the reverse deformation can be initiated by heating and the stored energy is released via thermal cycloreversion reaction. Given the ubiquity of the [2+2] cycloaddition in the solid state, the current study invites the development of new dimeric MOST architectures that utilize sunlight for energy storage and thermal triggers for energy release. Within a broader scope, this approach provides a platform for fabrication of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven crystal actuators capable of harnessing sunlight.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area, Ultra&#8208;thin Organic Films with Both Photochromic and Phosphorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doped materials used the most common plastic polymers (terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride) as hosts exhibited visible photochromic and room temperature phosphorescence phenomena simultaneously. A large&#8208;scale industrial&#8208;grade film that exhibited excellent photostability was successfully fabricated, enabling direct application.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most commonly used polymers in plastic products. Therefore, endowing these polymers with unique optical properties would significantly enhance their overall technological value. Herein, we synthesized a phosphorescent molecule, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuran (DBF), with notable reversible photochromic properties (switching between colorless and deep red) as the guest and constructed a doped system with the above polymers as the hosts. All doped materials exhibited both room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and reversible photochromic properties. The guest molecule exhibited strong reversible cyclization activity and small conformational changes during the reaction process, as well as moderate rigidity of the host matrix, which enabled the uncommon coexistence of these two properties in the doped system. Finally, DBF/PET was successfully formed into a transparent and uniform film with a length of 200&#8197;m, a width of 20&#8197;cm, a thickness of only 60&#8211;70&#8197;&#956;m. This film exhibited excellent thermal&#8208;stability, sensitivity, and resistance to photo&#8208;fatigue, indicating its applicability in industrial production.

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic Cycle of Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graph illustrates the complete electrochemical ammonia oxidation catalytic cycle by a ruthenium complex, capturing most intermediates. The pathways bifurcate at [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+, highlighting competitive steps including dimerization, nucleophilic attack, and disproportionation.







Abstract
This study presents a mechanism of ammonia oxidation catalyzed by [RuII(NH3)][PF6]2 (Ru=Ru(tpy)(dmabpy)) complexes. All intermediates, including the elusive [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuIV(NH)]2+, were detected, with several intermediates characterized spectroscopically. The catalytic cycle follows multiple reaction pathways branching at the key intermediates [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+. The competition between the pathways is influenced by ammonia concentration and the local proton concentration generated during electrooxidation at the anode. In the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming steps, dimerization of [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and nucleophilic attack of [RuIV(NH)]2+ by ammonia compete, while in the subsequent [RuII(N2H4)]2+ oxidation, direct oxidation competes with proton&#8208;catalyzed disproportionation. These findings provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the catalytic cycle and offer guidance for developing more efficient ruthenium&#8208;based ammonia oxidation catalysts.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Reduction and Biosynthesis towards Sustainable CO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) into long&#8208;chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value&#8208;added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO2 reduction to energy&#8208;rich sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8208;ZnO). The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8208;ZnO preferentially reduces CO2 to CH4 with a production rate of 1539.1 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 90%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#946;+). Subsequently, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene using photocatalytically&#8208;obtained CH4 as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9 mg L&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a green, low&#8208;energy pathway for the synthesis of long&#8208;chain compounds from CO2 as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long&#8208;term energy demands and sustainable CO2 upcycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferritin&#8211;Inspired Encapsulation and Stabilization of Gold Nanoclusters for High&#8211;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are highly promising for applications in photothermal conversion due to their exceptional surface area and optical properties. However, their high surface energy often leads to aggregation, compromising stability and performance. To address this, we developed a ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage with a near&#8208;enclosed cavity to physically stabilize AuNCs. This superphane cage coordinates with Au3+ ions, forming highly stable and uniform AuNCs upon reduction. The encapsulated AuNCs exhibit broad absorption (250&#8211;2500 nm) and achieve remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.8% under 808 nm laser irradiation. At low power densities (0.5 W/cm2), temperatures reach 150&#176;C, and under one&#8208;sun illumination (1 kW/m2), the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation efficiency reaches 95.1%, with a water evaporation rate of 2.35 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Even after 20 seawater desalination cycles, the system maintains a stable evaporation rate of 2.24 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, demonstrating excellent salt tolerance and durability. This ferritin&#8208;inspired strategy offers a robust platform for enhancing the stability and performance of AuNCs, advancing sustainable energy and water purification technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;induced Electrochemical Ion&#8208;Solvent Cointercalation in Pillared Titanate Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions are an avenue to reach improved kinetics compared to the corresponding intercalation of desolvated ions. Here, we demonstrate the impact of different structural pillar molecules on the electrochemical Li+ intercalation mechanism in expanded hydrogen titanate (HTO) electrode materials. We show that interlayer&#8208;expansion of HTO with organic pillars can enable cointercalation reactions. Their electrochemical reversibility is drastically improved when non&#8208;cross&#8208;linking pillars are employed that expand and separate the host material&#8217;s individual layers, underlining the impact of the electrochemo&#8208;mechanics of the nanoconfined interlayer space. This pillared HTO structure results in an increased Li+ storage capacity and reversibility compared to pristine HTO. We derive structural models of the pillared HTO host materials based on combined experiments and theoretical calculations, and employ electrochemical operando experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the nanoconfinement&#8208;induced cointercalation mechanism in pillared HTO electrode materials. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoconfined pillar molecules to modify host materials and enable highly reversible cointercalation reactions with improved capacity and kinetics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Double deprotonations of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts (IPr&#8208;Ar)X (1&#8208;Ar)X (IPr&#8208;Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Ar = Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with nBuLi afford the so&#8208;called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (2&#8208;Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}2). 2&#8208;Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid&#8208;state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]n (3&#8208;Ar) dimeric (n = 2) or trimeric (n = 3) molecular structure for 2&#8208;Ar. Treatment of 3&#8208;Ar with Et3B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt3)] (4&#8208;Ar) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. 3&#8208;Ar readily undergoes reactions with CO2 and N2O to form the ring&#8208;closing products Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] (5&#8208;Ar) and Li[(ADC)N2O] (6&#8208;Ar), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98% conversion, 99% selectivity, and 85% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Localization Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Argyrodite&#8208;based sulfide electrolytes have received considerable attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries owing to their high ionic conductivity and good mechanical property. However, the reactivity between sulfide electrolytes and lithium anode leads to continuous interfacial reactions and dendrites growth, which severely hinders their practical applications. We propose an electron localization strategy by modulating the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization within the PS4 tetrahedral structure of Li6PS5Cl through homogeneous incorporation of yttrium (Y) and oxygen (O). The introduction of Y strengthens the Madelung energy with sulfur (S) atom and induces the electronic localization of S atom, which suppresses the interaction between lithium metal and S atom of the tetrahedron. The air&#8208;stability is also enhanced due to oxygen introduction. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ formation of Li2O interphase acts as a protective barrier, synergistically mitigating the interfacial reactions between lithium metal and Li6PS5Cl. The Li symmetric cell with the modulated Li6PS5Cl electrolyte achieves stable lithium plating/stripping for over 4800 h. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with LiCoO2/Li&#8208;In electrode display a remarkable long cycle performance with 100% retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C. This study presents a distinct strategy that employs the electron localization driven by modulating orbital hybridization to achieve ultra&#8208;stable interface in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

However, the reactivity between sulfide electrolytes and lithium anode leads to continuous interfacial reactions and dendrites growth, which severely hinders their practical applications. We propose an electron localization strategy by modulating the d-p orbital hybridization within the PS4 tetrahedral structure of Li6PS5Cl through homogeneous incorporation of yttrium (Y) and oxygen (O). The introduction of Y strengthens the Madelung energy with sulfur (S) atom and induces the electronic localization of S atom, which suppresses the interaction between lithium metal and S atom of the tetrahedron. The air-stability is also enhanced due to oxygen introduction. Furthermore, the in-situ formation of Li2O interphase acts as a protective barrier, synergistically mitigating the interfacial reactions between lithium metal and Li6PS5Cl. The Li symmetric cell with the modulated Li6PS5Cl electrolyte achieves stable lithium plating/stripping for over 4800 h. The all-solid-state batteries with LiCoO2/Li-In electrode display a remarkable long cycle performance with 100% retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C.

         <title>A Multicomponent Reaction Integrating Selenium(II)&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Chemistry and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tools for rapidly constructing compound libraries with sufficient molecular diversity and complexity. Herein, to fully leverage a third aspect of molecular diversity enabled by the selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) reaction between alkynes and benzoselenazolones, a novel CuI&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction has been successfully developed. This reaction integrates SeNEx with CuAAC click chemistry, enabling rapid and regioselective synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high atom economy and good to excellent yields (65 examples, 50&#8208;95%). Notably, this MCR demonstrates excellent functional group tolerance and features modular, predictable, robust, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity (air and water compatibility). Extensive mechanism studies have revealed that this reaction proceeds by a unique SeNEx&#8208;CuAAC tandem reaction pathway, distinguishing it from conventional copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reactions. Importantly, a mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide Cu1 was synthesized and confirmed to be an efficient catalyst for the SeNEx reaction. This discovery provides crucial mechanistic insights into the preferential reactivity of alkynyl groups towards SeNEx over CuAAC. Furthermore, preliminary biological activity screening identified compound 14 as a potent inhibitor of&#160;Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase (EcGUS), with an IC50 value of 3.16 &#956;M. These findings underscore the significant potential of this MCR in synthetic chemistry, medical chemistry, and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided development of chemically tailored peptide binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 to enable versatile design of membrane protein&#8208;targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted membrane protein degradation using cell surface E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represents an effective strategy for treating membrane drug targets that cannot be fully inhibited using traditional inhibitors. Several ingenious chimeras have been developed to tether RNF43/ZNRF3 to target membrane proteins, resulting in the degradation of targets at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently available RNF43/ZNRF3 binders are genetically encoded and have poor plasticity, which limits the design and promotion of such PROTACs. Here, we exploited the alphafold predicted complex structures of ligand&#8208;bound RNF43/ZNRF3 and developed a class of chemically tailored peptide binders for ZNRF3/RNF43. With these peptide binders that can be conveniently prepared by de novo peptide synthesis, we established a new membrane protein degradation platform that allows versatile modular design and targeted degradation of clinically relevant membrane proteins, i.e. PD&#8208;L1 and EGFR. This study presents a new subtype within the PROTAC field to develop therapeutic peptides targeting membrane proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Crystal Packing in Heterocycloarenes by an Atom Engineering Strategy for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing (hetero)cycloarenes, an emerging class of ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications remains significantly constrained due to their synthesis challenge and limited diversity of available materials. Herein, a series of coplanar chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains were synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form, and chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes was investigated in detailed. As a result, sulfur&#8208;fused NS exhibits a closest herringbone crystal packing with &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance as low as 3.11 &#197;, resulting in a record&#8208;high hole mobility of 3.13 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped OSCs. Remarkably, selenium&#8208;fused NSe without intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in its crystalline state, also manifests a second&#8208;high mobility up to 2.11 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, which is attributed to the presence of extensive short&#8208;range edge&#8208;to&#8208;face Se&#8230;&#960; and C&#8211;H&#8230;&#960; interactions. Meanwhile, these heterocycloarenes exhibit a selective supramolecular interaction with C70, following a trend in binding constants: NS &lt; NO &lt; NSe. Overall, this work not only systematically elucidates the guide of atom engineering on heterocycloarenes for the first time, but also paves the way for practical applications of the emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSC materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13% to 18.58%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04% was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Multisite Cross&#8208;Linked Ligand Suppressing Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution&#8208;processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD&#8208;based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross&#8208;linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour&#8208;saturated green CsPbBr3&#8208;based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6% together with an operational lifetime of 1340 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd m&#8211;2, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15 min.), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6h) preponderant increased in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, i.e. proteins involved in the inflammatory response.
Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents have become increasingly important in modern synthetic chemistry. Previous studies have investigated electrophilic reagents featuring zero or one inactive bond; however, reactions involving electrophilic reagents with two inactive bonds remain unexplored. This study presents the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction under mechanical conditions, involving aryl ethers and aryl fluorides, both of which contain inactive bonds. The reaction successfully synthesized a series of multifunctional biphenyl compounds, specifically including several sparingly soluble substrates that are challenging to prepare in a solvent system. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that nickel and magnesium play a crucial role in the activation of C&#8208;F bonds. This novel coupling reaction offers a beneficial approach for polymer degradation and the development of luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pre&#8208;coordination of substrates to heterobimetallic complexes plays a key role in facilitating challenging bond activations and catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a family of low&#8208;valent phenyl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal nickelates containing a &#951;4&#8208;coordinated biphenylene ligand and demonstrate how the coordination and solvation preferences of the alkali&#8208;metal cation (Li, Na or K) influence the rate of C&#8211;C bond oxidative addition at nickel through combined structural, spectroscopic and computational studies. The rate of C&#8211;C bond cleavage can be further manipulated by replacing the two phenyl&#8208;carbanionic ligands with a cyclic 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl scaffold, which affords thermally stable and symmetric spirocyclic nickelates upon ring&#8208;opening.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver Molybdate Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy through Pyroptosis Conversion and Ferroptosis Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMO is synthesized via a rapid solvothermal method. After entering tumor cells, AMO consumes GSH and degrades H2O2 to generate ROS, while also produces MoO42&#8722; and Ag+. The intracellular GSH consumption and ROS induction lead to ferroptosis. In addition, MoO42&#8722; upregulates intracellular GSDME, and in combination with the stimuli of ROS and Ag+, the cells undergo caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Further, ferroptosis and pyroptosis synergistically enhance the immune response.







Abstract
Pyroptosis holds great potential in tumor therapy due to its strong immunogenicity. Several strategies, including ion interference therapy (IIT), are developed to induce pyroptosis. However, the mechanism by which metal oxoanions induced pyroptosis remained unclear. It was reported that MoO42&#8722; ions could stimulate immune responses, but their pyroptosis&#8208;inducing mechanisms were not fully understood. Herein, we synthesized uniform and dispersed silver molybdate (Ag2MoO4) nanoparticles (AMO) via a solvothermal method. AMO responded to H2O2 and glutathione (GSH) stimuli, releasing Ag+ and MoO42&#8722; ions, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and depleting GSH, thereby inducing ferroptosis and pyroptosis. The MoO42&#8722; also inhibited cell migration and upregulated GSDME expression, converting apoptosis into caspase&#8208;3/GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Additionally, DNA damage and ROS activated the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, enhancing innate immunity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of AMO and the immune checkpoint inhibitor &#945;PD&#8208;1 significantly inhibited tumor growth. This combination promoted dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, increased effector T cell numbers, induced M1 macrophage polarization, and alleviated immunosuppression. This study contributed to a deeper understanding of metal oxoanion&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, supporting its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Acetaldehyde Production from CO2 and H2O via Synergistic Vacancies and Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO2 represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd0.6Zn0.4S (CZS) photocatalyst co&#8208;modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8208;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO2 and H+, thereby promoting CO2 conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C2 intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 80% via photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53% at 400&#8201;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO2 conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Antimony Borosulfates Unveil a Modular System MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII=Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI=H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+)</title>

         <dc:description>
The second known three&#8208;dimensional borosulfate anionic topology demonstrates remarkable adaptability to hosting mono&#8208; and trivalent cations including the very first antimony borosulfates. Distinct one&#8208;dimensional channels accommodate these ions, with varying combinations leading systematically to different space groups. Our initial characterization includes single crystal as well as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermal analysis.







Abstract
Recently we reported the synthesis and characterization of Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4, at that time representing only the second tectosilicate analogous borosulfate. Inspired by this structure type, we herein present the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry. MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII=Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI=H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) were synthesised under solvothermal conditions and show a large variability towards their mono&#8208; and trivalent cation while retaining the same three&#8208;dimensional anionic network. Based on their combination, the titled compounds crystallize in the tetragonal space groups I

         <title>Defect Imide Double Antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi) as Potential Solar Cell Absorber Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonothermal method enabled the synthesis of antiperovskites with NH2&#8722;&#8208;groups instead of N3&#8722;&#8208; ions, which introduces vacancies and replaces the octahedral unit by square&#8208;pyramidal units. These imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi) showcase a new route to structurally engineer antiperovskites with cation&#8208;deficiencies. Their direct band gaps have been confirmed and density functional theory calculations revealed good band dispersion, transport properties and optical properties suitable for solar cell absorber materials.







Abstract
An abundance of oxide, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have been explored, demonstrating outstanding properties, while the emerging nitride perovskites are extremely rare due to their challenging synthesis requirements. By inverting the ion type in the perovskite structure, the corresponding antiperovskite structure is obtained. Among them, ternary antiperovskite nitrides X3AN (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg; A=As, Sb) have recently been identified as exhibiting excellent optoelectronic properties. To explore the unrealized composition space of nitride perovskites, the ammonothermal method was applied, yielding three new layered quaternary imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites, namely AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi). These new compounds feature distorted square&#8208;pyramidal coordination around the imide&#8208;group (Ca5NH). Layers with Ca2+ vacancies are found with an alternating As3&#8722; and Pn3&#8722; (Pn3&#8722;=Sb3&#8722;, Bi3&#8722;) coordination along the A&#8208;site, forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure. All three AE5AsPn(NH)2 compounds show suitable direct band gaps within the visible light spectrum. Density functional theory calculations reveal favorable band dispersion, as well as transport and optical properties, especially along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, demonstrating their 3D character of electronic transport. The narrow tunable direct band gaps and favorable charge carrier properties make AE5AsPn(NH)2 promising candidates for solar cell absorber materials.

         <title>The Ratio of sp2 and sp3 Hybridized Carbon Determines the Performance of Carbon&#8208;based Catalysts in H2O2 Electrosynthesis from O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, carbon&#8208;based catalysts are widely adopted. Our statistical analysis connivingly reveals that the ratio of sp2 to sp3 hybridized carbon, rather than the widely believed oxygen functional groups, is the key structural property determining the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Introducing oxygen&#8208; or carbon&#8208;containing functional groups is a widely adopted strategy to optimize the performance of carbon&#8208;based catalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR). Nevertheless, the specific contributions of these functional groups to enhance activity and selectivity are not well&#8208;defined and continue under debate. In this study, we systematically modified carbon materials by controlling the contents of oxygen functional groups (OFGs) and carbon functional groups (CFGs). Surface compositions were accurately quantified using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR performance was evaluated using a rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Through reliable statistical analyses, including partial least squares regression and linear regression, we explored the correlations between the surface compositional features &#8211; specifically the ratios of OFGs, CFGs, and sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon &#8211; and the catalytic performance metrics such as onset potential and H2O2 selectivity. Our findings challenge existing paradigms by demonstrating that the sp2/sp3 ratio is a critical factor in determining catalytic selectivity and a certain correlate with the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR onset potential. By tuning this ratio, we achieved nearly 100&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0.4&#8211;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and onset potential approached the thermodynamic potential (0.766&#8197;V vs. RHE for the O2/HO2&#8208; process), pointing a new direction in designing and developing advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Inert Weakly Solvating Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Micro&#8208;Sized Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) is designed to enable stable cycling of micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes in subzero environments. Through elaborate regulation of competitive coordination, the TIWSE preserves a temperature&#8208;independent anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and exhibits weak solvent coordination, enhancing the capacity retention and rate capability of &#956;Si anodes. This work addresses low&#8208;temperature challenges of high&#8208;energy &#956;Si||Ni&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes with high specific capacity are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but face significant volume changes during cycling. Constructing anion&#8208;derived, inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by electrolyte engineering is considered a viable strategy for stabilizing &#956;Si anodes. However, at low temperatures, temperature&#8208;dependent anion&#8208;dominated solvation and sluggish Li+ desolvation hinder cyclability and capacity retention. Here we introduce a unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) that preserves the anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and has weak solvent coordination capability, enabling stable cycling of &#956;Si anodes in subzero environments. The crucial role of NO3&#8722; anions with a high donor number in regulating competitive coordination in TIWSE is unveiled. As a result, &#956;Si||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with TIWSE demonstrate impressive capacity retention of 91.8&#8201;% at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 80.8&#8201;% at 30&#8201;&#176;C after 100 cycles, along with a high specific capacity of 137.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C. Furthermore, a 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell of Si&#8722;C||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 shows remarkable cycling stability with 89.3&#8201;% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 77.3&#8201;% retention at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating the practical applicability. This work highlights the importance of solvation chemistry in addressing low&#8208;temperature challenges and offers new insights into high&#8208;energy &#956;Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating under harsh conditions.

         <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Constrained Flexibility for Benchmark Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D ligand metal&#8722;organic framework ZUL&#8722;C6 with an alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system, obtains high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving separation for hexane isomer mixtures in a wide pressure range, benefiting from its constrained flexibility which is driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation and distortion of the coordination units with a high deformation energy barrier, achieving benchmark hexane isomer separation performance.Twitter/X handle: vigaryang76749.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for adsorptive separations, but achieving a balance among flexibility, adsorption capacity, and selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible MOF, Ni(bhdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL&#8722;C6), incorporating hybrid three&#8208;dimensional alkane&#8208;bridged ligands, which realizes high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving for hexane isomer separation &#8208; a critical process in the petroleum industry. The alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system within the ZUL&#8722;C6 framework facilitated a strong affinity for n&#8208;hexane and 3&#8208;methylpentane. However, the narrow pore size and the constrained flexibility limited the uptake of 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane (&lt;4.0&#8197;mg/g), accompanied by a high gate&#8208;opening pressure. The gating behavior was elucidated by guest&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal (SC) X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which revealed a unique SC to SC transformation driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation of the 3D bhdc linker and distortion of the metal cluster and pillar units, along with a high deformation energy barrier. As a result, ZUL&#8722;C6 exhibited not only significantly higher uptake and selectivity than the industrially used 5&#8197;A molecular sieve, but also the record&#8208;high nHEX/3MP breakthrough uptake (92.8/73.9&#8197;mg/g) and unprecedented 22DMB producing time (309.2&#8197;min/g, corresponding to the productivity of 770&#8197;mmol/kg and yield of 92.8&#8201;%) among reported MOFs.

         <title>A Green and Efficient Recycling Strategy for Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Neutral Solution Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the overuse of strong acids and bases in the conventional hydrometallurgy process, a delicate strategy has been proposed, which is pioneeringly applied in the neutral solution environment. Particularly, in situ primary battery effect based on the solid&#8208;solid reduction is designed and constructed, which can effectively enhance the reduction efficiency of high&#8208;valent metals by leveraging electron transfer during the neutral leaching. Thus, it can achieve ultrafast efficiency with reduced chemical consumption and corrosive wastewater, thus providing a promising and economic pathway for the battery recycling.







Abstract
Traditional acid or/and ammonia leaching techniques are usually applied to extract valuable metals during hydrometallurgical recovery of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the excessive and repeated use of acids and bases inevitably increases the environmental burden and safety threats. Herein, considering the advantages of neutral pH solution system in terms of safety and environmental protection, neutral leaching has been pioneeringly proposed to achieve a low&#8208;cost and harmless hydrometallurgical process. Specifically, benefited from the ligand complexation reaction of glycine, the valuable metals can be efficiently leached within neutral environment. More importantly, a strategy of solid&#8208;solid reduction with primary batteries effect is employed to achieve an efficient neutral leaching within rapid time, breaking through the reaction limitation of shrinking core model. As anticipated, an efficient leaching of 99.99&#8201;% Li, 96.86&#8201;% Ni, 92.35&#8201;% Co, and 90.59&#8201;% Mn can be achieved within 15 minutes, which has extended applications for various kinds of layered cathodes. Therefore, it is sturdily confirmed that the intractable problem, the effective extraction is available only under the aggressive acid/alkali&#8208;ion conditions, is well&#8208;solved within a mild leaching atmosphere. This green and efficient strategy in neutral solution environment opens a new pathway to realize the large&#8208;scale pollution&#8208;free recycling of spent batteries.

         <title>Pathway Engineering in Pd&#8208;Based Supramolecular Cage Synthesis via Inner&#8208;Outer Steric Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of ligand LA with palladium can selectively generate three types of assemblies: Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4. By changing the reaction conditions, the three assemblies can be transformed into each other. Based on this, introducing ligand LB can prepare Pd2LA3LB through 10 pathways, and the synthesis path of trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 can reach up to 16.







Abstract
For artificial supramolecular architectures designed to mimic biological systems, achieving different pathway synthesis is challenging due to the requirement of multiple stable and interconvertible intermediates. Here, we propose a novel &#8220;inner&#8208;outer steric synergy&#8221; strategy and investigate controllable pathway engineering for the synthesis of specific structures. Firstly, three structures (Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3 and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4) with interconversion properties were selectively formed by assembling externally modified ligand LA with Pd(II). Furthermore, Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2 can further assemble with the ligand LB with inner steric hindrance to generate heteroleptic trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 cage, while Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, as an intermediate, can assemble with LB to form Pd2LA3LB. It is noteworthy that Ring&#8208;Pd2LA2, Bowl&#8208;Pd2LA3, and Cage&#8208;Pd2LA4 can interconvert under specific conditions, enabling the synthesis of Pd2LA3LB and trans&#8208;Pd2LA2LB2 through 10 and 16 pathways, respectively. This research not only introduces a novel strategy for constructing heteroleptic cages but also demonstrates the achievement of pathway engineering.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Mass Discovery and High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Fluoroether&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Stability Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning (ML)&#8208;driven workflow was developed for electrolyte screening from vast chemical space through the fast assessment of the high&#8208;voltage stability of electrolytes, solvation ability of solvents to dissolve lithium salts and synthesizability of solvents. Among the recommended candidates, two solvents were synthesized and tested for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMB) application.







Abstract
Developing novel fluoroether electrolytes with high&#8208;voltage stability is an effective strategy to improve the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, the vast chemical space of fluoroether is underexplored due to the absence of effective tools to evaluate the potential used in high&#8208;voltage LMB. Herein, a framework was developed in combination of Voting ensemble algorithms and graph convolution neural network (GCNN), allowing the fast assessment of oxidative stability of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, synthesizability of solvents as well as the solvation ability of them to dissolve lithium salts. Potential fluoroether solvent candidates for high&#8208;voltage LMB were screened out from a virtual library comprising 5576 electrolytes constructed by a combination of 1510 solvents and 4 salts. Among them, two fluorinated ethers, 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) propane and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3,12&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5,10,13&#8208;tetraoxatetradecane, were successfully synthesized and showed satisfactory high&#8208;voltage stability, sufficient solvation ability and satisfactory cycling with almost 99.5&#8201;% coulombic efficiency in Li||NMC811 full cell. This work provided an efficient framework for the discovery of solvents with high&#8208;voltage tolerance in a vast structural space prior to experimental synthesis, accelerating the development of advanced electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Patternable and Healable Polymer Semiconductor Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Disulfide Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing functions have been successfully integrated into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor with relatively high charge mobility for the first time, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups. The results show that thin film of P3 exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity of 210&#8197;mJ&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and contrast of 1.2. Moreover, the scratched patterned thin films can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored.







Abstract
Apart from charge transport property, polymer semiconductors with patternable and healable functions are highly demanding for the fabrication of organic circuits. Herein, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups, we successfully integrate photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing capabilities into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor for the first time. The results show that the thin film of DPP&#8208;based conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor polymer with TA groups in the side chains exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity (S) of 210&#8197;mJ&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and contrast (&#947;) of 1.2. Importantly, the patterning process has minimal impact on thin film morphology, interchain stacking, and charge transport mobility. Moreover, the patterned thin films, which were initially scratched, can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored. In comparison, the scratched thin film of PDPP4T without TA groups in the side chains achieves only 82.6&#8201;% recovery of scratch depth and 54.5&#8201;% recovery of charge mobility under the same conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing multifunctional polymer semiconductors by incorporating TA groups in the side chains, offering a new pathway to lithography&#8208;compatible, self&#8208;healing smart flexible devices.

         <title>Metabolism&#8208;inspired chemical reaction networks for chemically driven dissipative oligoesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Metabolism is a complex network of chemical reactions in which transient biomolecules are continuously produced and degraded. Mimicking this dynamic process in synthetic systems poses a considerable challenge, as it requires designs that enable the exchange of energy and matter among transient molecules. In this study, we explored a chemically driven oligoesterification process operating within a highly intricate reaction network and constructed a dynamic library of transient oligoesters. Our kinetic analysis uncovered an intriguing phenomenon: oligoesters undergo parasitic exchanges, consuming one another to sustain the system's dynamics before reaching thermodynamic equilibrium. This discovery opens new opportunities for designing synthetic systems that replicate the complexity and self&#8208;sustaining behavior of metabolic processes.

         <title>An Artificial Copper&#8208;Michaelase Featuring a Genetically Encoded Bipyridine Ligand for Asymmetric Additions to Nitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient artificial copper&#8208;dependent Michaelase featuring a metal&#8208;binding unnatural amino acid, e.&#8201;g. bipyridyl alanine (BpyA), was optimized through directed evolution and applied in catalytic asymmetric additions of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes. Various chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Moreover, the reaction was performed at preparative scale and the product was used in follow&#8208;up derivatization reactions towards various high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are an attractive approach to achieving &#8220;new to nature&#8221; biocatalytic transformations. In this work, a novel copper&#8208;dependent artificial Michaelase (Cu_Michaelase) comprising a genetically encoded copper&#8208;binding ligand, i.&#8201;e. (2,2&#8208;bipyridin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)alanine (BpyA), was developed. For the first time, such an ArM containing a non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding amino acid was successfully optimized through directed evolution. The evolved Cu_Michaelase was applied in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes, yielding various &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives, which are precursors for a range of high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds, with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Additionally, the evolved variant could be further used in a preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, providing chiral products for diverse derivatizations. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis confirmed the binding of Cu(II) ions to the BpyA residues and showed that, in principle, there is sufficient space for the 2&#8208;acetyl azaarene substrate to coordinate. Kinetic studies showed that the increased catalytic efficiency of the evolved enzyme is due to improvements in apparent KM for both substrates and a notable threefold increase in apparent kcat for 2&#8208;acetyl pyridine. This work illustrates the potential of artificial metalloenzymes exploiting non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding ligands for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis.

         <title>An Azo Polymer with Abundant Active Sites and Extended Conjugation as a Stable Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel azo polymer (PTAP) with high site density and extended conjugated structure. The azo groups not only facilitate long&#8208;distance delocalization of &#960; electrons, but also act as an active center for the two electrons transfer to increase site density. The improved charge storage efficiency, excellent anti&#8208;solubility and rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer of PTAP endow zinc&#8208;organic batteries with high capacity, excellent rate performance, and remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Developing stable cathodes with high capacity and rapid redox kinetics is pivotal for aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A huge challenge lies in balancing the density of active sites and electronic conductivity of organic cathodes. Herein, an azo polymer from 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene&#8208;tetraone (PTAP) possessing high active components and extended conjugated structure was achieved. The extended conjugated system linked by the azo groups facilitates extensive electron delocalization and a low band gap, which endows the PTAP with enhanced electronic conductivity reaching 4.26&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1. The azo groups themselves serve as active centers for two&#8208;electron transfer, leading to a significant increase in the density of redox&#8208;active sites and charge storage efficiency. Moreover, strong intramolecular interactions and unique solvation structure bolster the anti&#8208;solubility of PTAP. Consequently, PTAP&#8208;based ZOBs exhibited high reversible capacities and rate performance, delivering 442.45&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining 248.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a ZOB showed remarkable long&#8208;term stability after cycling over 900&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies further revealed that multi&#8208;step coupling of carbonyl and azo groups accompanied by the Zn2+/H+ dual&#8208;ion insertion is responsible for rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer in PTAP. This work provides new insight into the rational design of advanced organic cathodes for high capacity and long life ZOBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerated Controllable Phase Transformation for Practical Liquid Metal Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable phase transformation electrode (PTE) was constructed, which enabled the NaK anode to process in near&#8208;solid to overcome the assembly difficulties of liquid electrodes, and then in&#8197;situ phase transformed to liquid within the battery for working to inhabit dendrites growth. The mechanism of self&#8208;induced liquid metal mediated solid&#8208;state reaction was proposed to promote this transition. Based on these, cylindrical cell with liquid NaK anode was successfully matched with outstanding electrochemical performances. The challenge of practical application of liquid electrodes is expected to be solved.







Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity, the deposition of solid alkali metals can trigger dendrites growth, causing safety risk, capacity and life decay. While liquid NaK alloy is dendrite&#8208;free, their fluidity may cause leakage or even short circuit. In this work, a novel controllable phase transformation strategy was proposed enabled NaK anode to be processed in near&#8208;solid and work in liquid, effectively overcoming the challenges of dendrite formation and leakage. Specifically, a near&#8208;solid anode was fabricated by liquid metal (LM)&#8208;assisted mechanochemistry reaction, which can be easily shaped and integrated into batteries without leakage risk. Then self&#8208;accelerated phase transformation continues within the battery, driven by an LM&#8208;mediated in&#8197;situ replacement reaction, converts the near&#8208;solid electrode into liquid state and enabling dendrite&#8208;free operation. For the first time, a cylindrical cell with liquid NaK alloy anode was successfully matched and demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances. This innovation not only enhances safety but also advancing the practical application of liquid metal electrodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Derived Halogen Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;derived halogen bond donors show much improved performance in anion binding and in organocatalysis compared to established neutral halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids like polyfluorinated terphenyls. This superior activity is most clearly demonstrated in the catalysis of a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction.







Abstract
Multidentate neutral halogen bonding catalysts based on iodinated icosahedral ortho&#8208;carborane moieties are introduced. Co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;studies, calorimetric measurements, and 1H NMR titrations demonstrate their strong binding to halides and neutral compounds, further underlined by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Thus, their superior Lewis acidity compared to traditional perfluorinated halogen&#8208;bond donors has been shown. The iodocarborane catalysts also outperformed the latter in a halide abstraction reaction and catalyzed a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction, which was previously out of reach for neutral halogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Ethylene or Ethanol via Tuning *OH Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the rational design of Cu defect sites with different *OH affinities for the selective CO2 reduction to produce C2H5OH or C2H4. Grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;rich Cu gives weaker *OH favors C2H5OH formation and amorphous Cu defect sites showed stronger *OH facilitates C2H4 formation. We achieved a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 29.0&#8201;% for C2H5OH and an impressive high full&#8208;cell EE of 25.6&#8201;% for C2H4, respectively.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) into ethylene (C2H4) or ethanol (C2H5OH) is a high challenge. In this study, the rational manipulation of Cu defect sites was realized for the selective formation of C2H5OH and C2H4. Low&#8208;coordination amorphous and medium&#8208;coordination grain&#8208;boundary Cu defect sites with different *OH affinity were found to play a decisive role in the selective protonation of CH2CHO*. In particular, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;rich Cu (denoted as Cu&#8208;1) that weakly adsorbed *OH and CH2CHO* favored the protonation on &#946;&#8208;C of CH2CHO*, leading to the selective production of C2H5OH. In contrast, amorphous Cu defect sites (denoted as Cu&#8208;3) showed strong *OH adsorption and then strong CH2CHO* adsorption, facilitating C&#8722;O breaking and C2H4 formation. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configuration, a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 29.0&#8201;% for C2H5OH on Cu&#8208;1 and an impressive high full&#8208;cell EE of 25.6&#8201;% for C2H4 on Cu&#8208;3 were observed. In addition, a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.4&#177;1.5&#8201;% was achieved on Cu&#8208;3 at a notable current of 12.5&#8197;A with a 25&#8197;cm&#8722;2 MEA configuration. These results provided crucial insights into the significance of defect sites in manipulating the adsorption of *OH for the selective production of C2H4 or C2H5OH.

         <title>Pyridoxal&#8208;Inspired Photo&#8208;Decarboxylase Catalysis: Photochemical Decarboxylation of Unprotected Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the decarboxylation (deCO2) of unprotected amino acids inspired by pyridoxal&#8208;dependent decarboxylases is described. Catalytic condensation of amino acids onto a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables hyperconjugation&#8208;enabled photoexcitation can occur, which in combination with a thiol hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) co&#8208;catalyst facilitates a net biomimetic transformation via non&#8208;natural photo&#8208;decarboxylase catalysis.







Abstract
A photochemical organocatalytic method for the protodecarboxylation of unprotected amino acids is reported. Inspired by pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent decarboxylase enzymes, the catalytic activation of amino acid substrates by 3&#8208;hydroxyisonicotinaldehyde enables a photochemical decarboxylation event, which can be leveraged in combination with a thiol co&#8208;catalyst. The necessary and sufficient structural features of the pyridoxal&#8208;like framework for photoactivity are determined using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy. A broad scope of unprotected amino acids can be decarboxylated in this system, with selectivity between multiple carboxylates realized on the possible basis of hyperconjugation. The ability to engage simple amino acids in decarboxylative functionalization at ambient conditions using a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables new possibilities for the translation of biogenic amino acids into medicinally valuable amines.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity in Aerobic Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol over TiO2 Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen (O2) through a two electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), thereby reducing the unwanted &#8901;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening reaction of aromatics to significantly enhance selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol using molecular oxygen (O2) is a promising alternative to the traditional cumene process. However, the selectivity toward phenol is often poor due to the ring&#8208;opening reaction induced by the superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;), which is predominantly produced from the single&#8208;electron reduction of O2. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) facilitates the activation of O2 through a two&#8208;electron reduction process instead of a single&#8208;electron reduction. This effectively suppresses the generation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, thereby reducing phenol decomposition and significantly enhancing the selectivity. In addition, these OVs can trap the electrons to promote chare separation and serve as the adsorption sites for O2 activation. As a result, the introduction of abundant OVs on the surface of TiO2 not only enhances phenol yield but also importantly improves selectivity toward phenol. This finding enriches our understanding of how OVs influence reaction pathways and product selectivity, providing valuable insights for the design and tailoring of OV&#8208;rich photocatalysts for selective organic oxygenations.

         <title>Direct Photopatterning of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks via Photoinduced Fluorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a mild UV exposure dose (10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2), fluorinated azide molecules covalently bind to ZIFs via hydrocarbon insertion, resulting in fluorination and significantly increasing their stability in water. This method successfully realizes large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution direct lithography by selective exposure and water immersion.







Abstract
Precise and effective patterning strategies are essential for integrating metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into microelectronics, photonics, sensors, and other solid&#8208;state devices. Direct lithography of MOFs with light and other irradiation sources has emerged as a promising patterning strategy. However, existing direct lithography methods often rely on the irradiation&#8208;induced amorphization of the MOFs structures and the breaking of strong covalent bonds in their organic linkers. High&#8208;energy sources (such as X&#8208;rays or electron beams) and large irradiation doses &#8211; conditions unfavorable for scalable patterning &#8211; are thus required. Here, we report a photoinduced fluorination chemistry for patterning various zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) under mild UV irradiation. Using UV doses as low as 10&#8197;mJ&#8201;cm&#8722;2, light&#8208;sensitive fluorine&#8208;containing molecules covalently bond to ZIFs and enhance their stability in water. This creates a water&#8208;stability contrast between ZIFs in exposed and unexposed regions, enabling scalable direct photolithography of ZIFs with high resolution (2&#8197;&#956;m) on 4&#8208;inch wafers and flexible substrates. The patterned ZIFs preserve their original crystallinity and porous properties while gaining increased hydrophobicity. This allows for the demonstration of a water&#8208;responsive fluorescent MOFs array with implications in sensing and multicolor information encryption.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte prepared via diluting the ionic liquid electrolyte with non&#8208;solvating 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzene co&#8208;solvent facilitates the deposition of Emim+ and Al&#8722;Cl species for the formation of a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Al&#8722;Se batteries. This prevents the dissolution of poly&#8208;selenides and their deposition on Al metal anode, ultimately enhancing the cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Al&#8722;Se batteries (ASeBs) with high theoretical specific capacity and discharge voltage are promising energy storage devices. However, the detrimental shuttle effect occurring in conventional ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) challenges their development. Herein, a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is constructed via employing locally concentrated IL electrolytes (LCILEs) to overcome these issues. It is demonstrated that LCILEs facilitate the incorporation of Emim+ into the electrode/electrolyte interphases, and, meanwhile, more Al&#8722;Cl species deposits are observed in the CEI. The formed CEI effectively prevents the dissolution of poly&#8208;selenides, inhibiting their related parasitic reactions. These result in ASeBs, employing the LCILE, to deliver a specific discharge capacity of 218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while the cell using the neat ILE only maintains 38&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the same conditions. Moreover, an Al&#8722;S cell operated in LCILEs reaches 578&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles, which is also significantly better than 317&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the neat ILE. This study provides an LCILE&#8208;based strategy to reinforce the CEI in order to suppress the shuttle effect, realizing Al&#8208;chalcogen batteries with better performance.

         <title>Highly Effective and Durable Integrated&#8208;Chainmail Electrode for H2 Production through H2S Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust integrated electrode that features a dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam is developed to enhance H2S electrolysis for green hydrogen production. The unique integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly improves both the activity and stability of the nickel foam. This chainmail electrodes realizes efficient hydrogen production at a high power of 224&#8197;W with 43&#8201;% electricity consumption reduction.







Abstract
H2S is a prevalent yet toxic gas commonly encountered during fossil fuel extraction, whose electrolysis not only addresses pollution concerns but also facilitates hydrogen production. However, the advancement of H2S electrolysis at high current density has been impeded by the lack of stable and highly active electrodes that can endure the corrosive effects of H2S poisoning. Herein, we present an integrated&#8208;chainmail electrode that features dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam (Ni@NC foam) to enhance H2S electrolysis. The electrode comprises a primary chainmail, formed by graphene coating on the surface of nickel foam, and a secondary chainmail, created by graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles. This integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly enhances both the activity and stability of nickel foam, which delivers an industrial&#8208;scale high current density exceeding 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, above five times higher than nickel foam. Moreover, the Ni@NC foam remains stable over 300&#8197;hours of test, demonstrating a lifespan at least ten times longer than nickel foam. In a demo for H2S removal from simulated natural gas, the Ni@NC foam as the electrodes exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 272&#8197;ml&#8201;min&#8722;1, while reducing electricity consumption by 43&#8201;% compared with traditional water electrolysis.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Uric Acid Oxidation via Interdistance&#8208;Dependent Switching Pathways in Correlated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Boosting Sensing Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlated ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts (Ru c&#8208;SACs) with tailored single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) of 9.3&#8197;&#197;, 7.0&#8197;&#197;, and 6.2&#8197;&#197; were prepared via organometallic design. The Ru c&#8208;SAC with 6.2&#8197;&#197; SAD exhibited superior uric acid electrooxidation activity due to the optimal inter&#8208;atomic distance facilitating a three&#8208;electron transfer pathway, substantiated by comprehensive experimental studies and theoretical computations, and unveiling atomic&#8208;level SAD&#8208;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The overly simplistic geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a significant bottleneck in the field of single&#8208;atom sensing, impeding both the design of highly efficient electrochemical sensors and the establishment of structure&#8211;activity relationships. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy to boost the sensing performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts by precisely tuning the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs). A series of Ru&#8208;based c&#8208;SACs (Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197;, Rud=7.0&#8201;&#197;, and Rud=9.3&#8201;&#197;) are synthesized with predetermined SAD values, which are comprehensively characterized by various techniques. Electrochemical studies on uric acid (UA) oxidation reveal that Rud=6.2&#8201;&#197; demonstrates an extraordinary sensitivity of 9.83&#8197;&#956;A &#956;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;2, which is superior to most of electrochemistry biosensors reported previously. Kinetic analysis and product examination unveil that the 6.2&#8197;&#197; Ru SAD instigates a distinctive three&#8208;electron oxidation of UA, with an extra electron transfer compared to the conventional two&#8208;electron pathway, which fundamentally enhances its sensitivity. Density functional theory calculations confirm the optimal SAD facilitates dual&#8208;site UA adsorption and accelerated charge transfer dynamics. This investigation provides novel insights into the strategic engineering of high&#8208;performance SAC&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by precisely controlling the atomic&#8208;scale structure of active sites.

         <title>Chemoselective Functionalization of Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds of Allylic Ethers: Enantioconvergent Access to sec,tert&#8208;Vicinal Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel dual photoredox/nickel catalytic system that enables chemo&#8208; and enantioselective functionalization of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds in allyl ethers through the generation of nucleophilic &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ni intermediates. This methodology establishes a versatile platform for constructing highly functionalized homoallylic sec, tert&#8208;vicinal diol frameworks, demonstrating exceptional stereocontrol (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee), broad functional group tolerance, and compatibility with diverse substrates.







Abstract
While enantioenriched alcohols are highly significant in medicinal chemistry, total synthesis, and materials science, the stereoselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with two adjacent stereocenters remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a dual catalysis approach utilizing photoredox and nickel catalysts to enable the unprecedented chemoselective functionalization of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds in allyl ethers instead of cleaving the C&#8722;O bond. The resulting allyl&#8208;Ni intermediates can undergo coupling with various aldehydes, facilitating a novel enantioconvergent approach to access extensively functionalized homoallylic sec,tert&#8208;vicinal diols frameworks. This protocol exhibits nice tolerance towards functional groups, a broad scope of substrates, excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggested that allyl&#8208;NiII acts as the nucleophilic species in the coupling reaction with carbonyls.

The enantiomers thus showed single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPL) and also exhibited white circularly polarized electroluminescence in white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a color rendering index (CRI) of 82 at CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33).







Abstract
A pair of multi&#8208;emission enantiomers, (R)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ and (S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ, was designed and synthesized by integrating Se&#8208;induced conformationally isomeric donors with a chiral carbonyl&#8208;containing acceptor into a unified molecular framework. The enantiomers showed white emission with blue, yellow and red multi&#8208;emission bands in solution and film at CIE coordinates of (0.39, 0.35) and (0.33, 0.34), respectively. Doped film of the enantiomers achieved a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 42&#8201;%, accompanied by mirror&#8208;image white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPPL) signals with a |gPL| value of 2.6&#215;10&#8722;3. Moreover, the enantiomers also showed white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33) and EQEmax of 3.1&#8201;%. Notably, this work represents the first single&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;emission WCPL materials and achieved the highest performance for white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule organic materials with phosphorescent properties. Furthermore, leveraging Bragg reflection from dual&#8208;layer cholesteric liquid crystals, the enantiomers achieved |gPL| and |gEL| values of 1.85 and 1.88, respectively, marking the highest reported values for WCPPL and WCPEL to date.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether from Syngas over Nanoparticle&#8208;Derived Bifunctional Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether (STD) process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial process that utilizes Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. Here, we report a highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, in which Pd colloids dispersed in a nanoscale CeO2 matrix serve as the key building block for the methanol&#8208;active component, efficiently catalysing the STD reaction. For Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 with a high Pd&#8208;CeO2 interface concentration, CO conversion and dimethyl ether yield are significantly increased compared to Pd supported on Al2O3. Systematic investigations using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques reveal the formation of highly dispersed palladium clusters/particles confined within the nanoparticulate CeO2 matrix. The superior catalytic performance in both activity and stability observed for the Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 in the STD reaction stems from the active cationic palladium interfacial species and the presence of adjacent O vacancies.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainability&#8208;inspired upcycling of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer on continuous&#8208;flow reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing requirement for phosphorus resources and their shortage in nature, cyclic utilization of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer might offer a sustainable approach to achieve the recycling of phosphorus. Herein, we first report the selective degradation of organophosphorus pollutants (such as HEDP and glyphosate), via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and sodium percarbonate (SPC), into phosphates, which are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on the continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Quenching experiments, EPR result, electrochemical analysis, and DFT calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e. &#8729;OH, &#8729;O2&#8208;, 1O2 and CO3&#8729;&#8208;) for HEDP degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.2% decrease in COD and 37.8% decrease in TOC after 90 min. Indeed, HPLC confirms that glyphosate is completely degraded in 90 min with the formation of 271.93 &#956;mol/L of o&#8208;PO43&#8208;, which is further converted into phosphatic fertilizer by the precipitation of struvite with 87.2% yield on continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Finally, biotoxicity of glyphosate to zebrafish and wheat seeds are significantly deceased after treatment of PMS/SPC system by zebrafish toxicology assays and germination tests of wheat seeds.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni Bridge in Ordered Macroporous Interface for Electrochemical Urea Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La&#8208;induced three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49 V @ 80 &#176;C) and 280 h stability test at 1 A cm&#8211;2 current density (25 &#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV&#8208;vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&#948;+ (&#948; &#8805; 3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR&#8208;IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation Engineering to Strengthen Interface Contacts in Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance. Herein, we report strengthening crystal/substrate contact by nucleation engineering based on in situ growth strategy. Through modulating the hole transport layer (HTL) to induce the nucleation process at substrate surface, interface residual solution, voids, and small&#8208;sized crystals are eliminated, thus ensuring intimate interface contact physically. Combining with strong interaction between perovskites and HTL, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed nonradiative recombination are achieved. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% is obtained, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Moreover, the thermal&#8208;induced peeling&#8208;off of crystals from substrates is mitigated, which improves the device thermal stability distinctly.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzobisoxazole Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have attracted extensive interest in solar energy to hydrogen conversion. However, insufficient light harvesting and difficult exciton dissociation severely limit the improvement of photocatalytic activity for COFs, thereby impeding the progression of this advanced field. In this work, two benzobisoxazole bridged and fully conjugated 2D&#8208;COFs with triazine (COF&#8208;JLU44) and pyrene (COF&#8208;JLU45) units were constructed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation, and they hold long&#8208;range ordered structures, largely acceptable surface area and fascinating photoelectric properties. Significantly, COF&#8208;JLU45 exhibits an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and superior reusability in the presence of 1.0 wt% Pt under light irradiation, coupled with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9% at a long wavelength of 600 nm. Multiple spectroscopy and theoretical simulation demonstrate the ingenious design of COF&#8208;JLU45 widen its light absorption and effectively promote the exciton dissociation. This finding contributes valuable insights for constructing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting the Kinetics of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via the Facet&#8208;Dependent Activation of Acetylene over Silver Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic silver (Ag) sites exhibit a robust ability to suppress undesired C&#8722;C coupling in the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) into ethylene (ESAE), leading to satisfactory selectivity and stability. However, the relatively low reaction kinetics still hinder its practical value. Here, the facet&#8208;dependent ESAE performance is first evaluated to increase the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics and provide mechanistic insight for subsequent catalyst design. As a result, the Ag nanocubes with {100} surfaces demonstrate a partial current density of 337 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.5 V vs. RHE, greatly outperforming their counterparts with {111} surfaces exposed. Further comparisons of H2O splitting and C2H2 hydrogenation reveal that the activation of C2H2 is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of ethylene electrosynthesis. Additionally, experimental and theoretical mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that stronger C2H2 adsorption over the {100} surface strengthens the &#960; conjugation of C2H2, leading to the delocalization of &#960; electrons to promote the activation of C2H2 for enhanced hydrogenation kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulated Multicomponent Reaction Pathway by Pore&#8208;Confinement Effect in MOFs for Highly Efficient Catalysis of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of flue gas CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond&#8208;formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free framework (Cu&#8208;TCA) was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO2 by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5 &#197; &#215; 6.5 &#197; in Cu&#8208;TCA selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger&#8208;sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO2 and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in Cu&#8208;TCA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of Cu&#8208;TCA with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.</dc:description>

         <title>Target Agnostic Photoaffinity Labelling by Sulfonylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonyl hydrazones were identified as new photo&#8208;crosslinkers exploiting their base catalyzed low&#8208;energy photoactivation that leads to reactive carbenes. The amino acid promiscuity, their usefulness in proteomics application and the range of labelled targets including enzymes, a PPI target and a transcription factor suggests that sulfonyl hydrazones might be a target agnostic alternative to current photoaffinity tags. Their synthetic availability and the option of late&#8208;stage formation make them beneficial in both chemical biology and drug discovery applications.







Abstract
Photoaffinity labeling is a widely used methodology for interrogating small molecule&#8208;protein interactions. However, these applications are limited by the few photo&#8208;crosslinkers that typically modify the affinity and the binding mode of the original ligand. Here, we report the development of new target agnostic photoaffinity warheads, sulfohydrazones that form a reactive carbene upon UV irradiation. Careful optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to effectively label five different amino acid residues in proteins. Our approach turned biologically relevant hydrazones and sulfohydrazones to intrinsically irreversible covalent binders without structural modifications by photoactivation as demonstrated on monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) enzyme and STAT5b (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b) transcription factor. Sulfohydrazones are readily accessible by transforming the corresponding carbonyl group of a ligand or a suitable tag that extends the application domain of the method for any ligands exemplified by conditional labelling of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme and the oncogenic mutant of GTP&#8208;ase KRasG12D.

         <title>Lactate&#8208;Modulating Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial Respiration Block for Tumor Immunosuppression Remodeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;dopped copper nitride (Cu3N&#8722;C) acts as a lactate oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme. C doping enhances n&#8722;&#963;* delocalization of the oxygen lone pair from lactate C&#8722;OH bond, weakening hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H for efficient lactate dehydrogenation, which benefits tumor immunosuppression remodeling. The as&#8208;generated pyruvate is further blocked for influx into mitochondrial respiration via inhibition of PDH complex by Cu3N&#8722;C.







Abstract
Abnormal lactate metabolism in tumor cells leads to immune escape in the tumor microenvironment. Intervening in specific lactate metabolic pathways while blocking downstream pyruvate influx holds great promise for overcoming conventional lactate&#8208;targeted therapy limitations such as short half&#8208;life, insufficient lactate consumption, and pathological microenvironment elasticity. Herein, a nanocatalytic medicine based on carbondoping engineered copper nitride enzyme (Cu3N&#8722;C NE) with enhanced lactate oxidase (LOX) activity was carefully designed. Computational results revealed that the introduction of C favors activation of the hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H bond in lactate by the polarization of adjacent hydroxyl groups, correspondingly facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the desired &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;H groups in lactate via the hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) process. The Cu3N&#8722;C NEs could downregulate lactate levels in tumor cells for robust remodeling of the immunosuppressive microenvironment and further block as&#8208;generated pyruvate to influx into the mitochondrial respiration, achieving lactate homeostasis reprogramming. Our study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of next&#8208;generation lactate&#8208;modulation nanomedicine via heteroatom&#8208;doping and evolution with the additional potential to expedite the industrial production of lactate to pyruvate.

         <title>Quantum Chemical Understanding of the O2 Release Process from Nature's Water Splitting Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations reveal that O2 release from nature's water splitting cofactor is initiated by the Mn3&#8722;O5 bond cleavage, without an initial conformational change of the peroxide [O5&#8208;Ox]2&#8722; group. This pathway is kinetically dominant because of the maximum stability of the rate&#8208;limiting transition state.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis plays a vital role in the supply of energy and oxygen necessary for the survival of biological organisms. The current leading proposal of the O&#8722;O bond formation in photosystem II suggests the coupling between the central &#956;&#8208;oxo (O5) and the additional oxygenic ligand (Ox) of the manganese&#8208;calcium oxide cofactor.

&lt;p&gt;Quantum chemical calculations reveal that O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release from nature's water splitting cofactor is initiated by the Mn3&#8722;O5 bond cleavage, without an initial conformational change of the peroxide [O5-Ox]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group. This pathway is kinetically dominant because of the maximum stability of the rate-limiting transition state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural photosynthesis plays a vital role in the supply of energy and oxygen necessary for the survival of biological organisms. The current leading proposal of the O&#8722;O bond formation in photosystem II suggests the coupling between the central &#956;-oxo (O5) and the additional oxygenic ligand (Ox) of the manganese-calcium oxide cofactor. However, the subsequent process through which molecular dioxygen is formed and released remains elusive. In this report, quantum chemical calculations reveal that the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release process is initiated by the cleavage of the Mn&#8722;O5 bond, without a preliminary conformational change of the peroxide [O5-Ox]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group. Subsequently, the [O5-Ox] moiety is converted from the superoxide to the weakly bound quasi-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the Mn&#8722;Ox bond is cleaved, and after a twist of the quasi-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit, the free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is ultimately released. Alternative pathways display significantly slower kinetics, due to the lower structural stabilities of the rate-limiting transition states. The cause of the difference is associated with the Jahn-Teller axial orientation and the local ring strain within the Mn cluster. These findings contribute to unravelling the intricate mechanism involved in an important step of photosynthetic oxygen evolution for a deeper understanding of nature's water oxidation catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Generation of Negative Hydrogen with Bimetallic&#8208;Ternary&#8208;Structured Catalysts for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) with in situ negative hydrogen (H&#8208;) has received extensive attention as an alternative to conventional high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation processes. However, the insufficient activity of hydrogen production and unclear the conversion process of hydrogenation remain a great challenge. In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary&#8208;structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1&#8208;TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H&#8208; donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716 min&#8208;1. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 achieved &gt;90% yields within 3&#8208;4 hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB. Mechanistic studies revealed that the high hydrolysis activity was due to that the Ru SA and Co SA sites of the bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalyst required the lowest energy for the activation of AB and H2O, respectively. Remarkably, the Co SA and Ru clusters exhibited an obvious synergistic effect in the TH process, which promoted the tandem hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. This work demonstrated an efficient approach to generate H&#8208; donor with bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts in TH process and further provided new inspiration on the development of multifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary-structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1-TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H- donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1-TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716 min-1. The Ru1+nCo1-TiO2 achieved &amp;gt;90% yields within 3-4 hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide bandgap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8208;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8208;P bond distinguishes SrIn3Si4P11 from the kindred SrIn3Si4P9, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30&#8208;fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50 eV broadening in bandgap compared to SrIn3Si4P9. Theoretically calculated analysis reveals that the &#960; interactions and the significant polarization anisotropy of the P&#8208;P bond are critical factors contributing to the enhancement of NLO performance. The present study uncovers the pivotal significance of P&#8208;P bond in structural design and NLO properties optimization, and delineates a clear research direction for the extensive advancement of phosphides NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transmission and Amplification from Cellulose Derivative to Achiral Helical Polymer for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of cellulose derivative and racemic helical polyacetylene achieves full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The elegant combination of solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transmission and fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption further enables the CPL handedness and intensity to be easily tunable, providing a novel strategy for the construction and performance regulation of cellulose&#8208;based chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Cellulose derivatives represent a promising natural chiral platform for creating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials owing to their excellent processability and structural diversity. However, achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions based on cellulose derivatives remains challenging. The present work reports the first success in achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions leveraging chirality transmission and amplification from cellulose derivative to achiral helical polymer. Importantly, such chirality transfer displays a dependence on the hydrogen bond accepting ability of solvent, making it effortless to precisely regulate chiral intensity by single or combined solvents. Moreover, the induced chirality in helical polymer is further transferred to the introduced racemic fluorescent dyes, resulting in full&#8208;color and white&#8208;light CPL emissions with a maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and 62.9&#8201;%, respectively. Further spatially separating the chiral and fluorescent components allows inversion of CPL handedness and precise modulation of CPL intensity. Notably, circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and chiral logic gate with multiple information outputs are successfully developed. This work gives an impetus to construct cellulosic chiroptical materials, offering more insights into chirality transfer between biomacromolecules and synthetic helical polymers.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insight into the Enantioselectivity of (R)&#8208;Selective Styrene Monooxygenases: A Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Proximal and Distal Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of an (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenase (SeStyA) revealed that the sizes of two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312) relative to the C=C bond govern substrate binding orientation by a distinct &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; mechanism that determines enantioselectivity. Based on this mechanism, a series of SeStyA variants were engineered to produce both enantiomers with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Group E flavoprotein monooxygenases (GEMs) are well&#8208;known for catalyzing enantioselective epoxidation reactions. However, engineering their enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge, largely due to a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Among these enzymes, (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenases ((R)&#8208;SMOs) stand out due to their unusual enantio&#8208;switch behavior when catalyzing the reactions of p&#8208;substituted styrenes. This unique property provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate the enantiocontrol mechanisms within GEMs. In this study, we resolved the first crystal structure of an (R)&#8208;SMO, SeStyA, derived from Streptomyces. By integrating this structural information with molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified four key residues critical to enantiodivergency: two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312). Strikingly, a &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; mechanism was revealed through saturation mutagenesis, wherein the side&#8208;chain sizes of proximal and distal residues exerted opposing influences on enantioselectivity at the C=C bond. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we successfully engineered SMOs with excellent (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity.

The process of Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (pCO2RR) into valuable chemicals is a contributing step to a sustainable future. Perovskites have high light absorption capacity in the visible spectrum, and reduction in dimensionality from 3D to 2D changes the structural and chemical properties. The review focuses on unfolding the unique properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Perovskites that make them favorable photocatalysts. The motive is to highlight and discuss their recent advances in pCO2RR using solid&#8208;vapor and liquid&#8208;solid methods, along with a basic structural discussion. This review also emphasizes innovative material design strategies and catalysis developments in 2D perovskites to enhance pCO2RR.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of Carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals is one of the most promising approaches to addressing the CO2 emission problem. However, several issues still need to be resolved to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Perovskites possess superior light absorption capacity, tunable band gaps, high defect tolerance, and diverse dimensionality. Among them, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are more stable under photocatalytic conditions and have exciting excitonic characteristics compared to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites.&#160;2D perovskites have unique physical and chemical properties, such as high stability, polaron formation, quantum well structures, and high exciton binding energies, which remain underexplored for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (pCO2RR). Tuning these properties is easier in 2D perovskites than in 3D perovskites by varying the layer thickness and spacer cations. Therefore, 2D perovskite photocatalysts are emerging as promising materials for reducing CO2 into valuable products. This review discusses the classification and synthesis methods of 2D perovskites, the unique properties that make them favorable for photocatalysis, and recent advances in applying 2D perovskites for pCO2RR by monitoring the operational methodology. It also emphasizes the potential for future developments in photocatalysis using 2D perovskites.

         <title>Catalytic Amino Group Transfer Reactions Mediated by Photoinduced Nitrene Formation from Rhodium&#8208;Hydroxamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photoinduced generation of Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoids and their catalytic nitrene transfer reactivity using thermally stable, yet photoactive Rh&#8208;hydroxamate. Combined EPR, mass, and DFT studies suggested that Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid species could be furnished via the photoactivation of Rh&#8208;hydroxamates. Further catalytic amidation reactivity of hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to form new C&#8722;N, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds was explored.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic platform to access transient nitrenoids by designing photo&#8208;responsive neutral rhodium&#8208;hydroxamate complexes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and mass spectrometric analysis, suggest that electrophilic Fischer&#8208;type Rh&#8208;acylnitrenoid intermediates could be generated via photoactivation of corresponding Rh&#8208;hydroxamates via N&#8208;O bond homolysis and redox event. Moreover, catalytic acylnitrenoid transfer was explored toward the amidation of various hydrocarbons, amines, and alcohols to furnish new N&#8722;C, N&#8722;N, and N&#8722;O bonds.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zinc Halogen Aqueous Battery Exploiting [BrCl2]&#8722; Storage in Ketjenblack by Reconstructing Electrolyte Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance zinc halogen aqueous battery has been developed by creating new [Br2Cl]&#8722;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8722;/Cl&#8722; redox couples, utilizing sophisticated nanopore confinement within a Ketjenblack host and coordination chemistry via reconstructing electrolyte structure, which delivers an impressive discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g|KB&#8722;1 and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg|KB&#8722;1.







Abstract
Halogen redox couples offer distinct merits due to high redox potential and low cost, but they usually suffer from poor reversibility. Here, we report highly reversible [Br2Cl]&#8722;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8722;/Cl&#8722; redox couples via harnessing interhalogen chemistry within nanoporous Ketjenblack (KB) carbon as a host for zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries. The tunable halogen reactions are facilitated by controllable coordinating chemistry of [ZnCl4&#8208;xBrx]2&#8722; in a hydrated deep eutectic solvent electrolyte comprising ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and choline chloride (C5H14ClNO). In an optimized electrolyte, the KB electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;gKB&#8722;1 or 214&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 when the stored [BrCl2]&#8722; is counted at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an average discharge voltage of ~1.6&#8197;V, and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgKB&#8722;1 or 315&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, when considering the mass of [BrCl2]&#8722; as well. Benefiting from the interhalogen coordination chemistry and KB pore host, the pouch cell delivers an areal capacity of 2.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, storing an energy density of ~80&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of both electrodes. This work offers a new strategy to enhance the reversibility of static aqueous halogen batteries for energy storage applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Synergism&#8208;Enhanced Liquid Metal Locomotion for Unrestricted Circuit Substrate Patterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal is demonstrated, incubating the method for efficiently and precisely patterning liquid metal over a broad range of substrates, where the gallium redox states&#8208;mediated synergistic electrochemical energy transduction drives the enhanced liquid metal locomotion behaviour.







Abstract
The critical challenge in advancing liquid metal circuits (LMCs) lies in achieving interfacial compatibility with diverse substrates while dynamically balancing fabrication efficiency and quality to ensure robust conductive stability. Here we introduce an electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal (E&#8208;rsLM) that enables the controllable generation of diverse intermetallic bond transition layers (Cu, Au, or Fe&#8208;based) between liquid metal and unrestricted substrate surfaces, applicable in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. It involves enhanced locomotion of the liquid metal, driven by synergistic electrochemical energy transduction from cyclic changes in gallium redox states. Characterized by expansion&#8208;contraction&#8208;expansion, it enables unique self&#8208;propelled bouncing, tuning spreading speed (up to ~26.8&#8197;mm/s) and elongation rate (up to 1192&#8201;%) with a volume of only 80&#8197;&#956;L. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of E&#8208;rsLM fabrication across 30 different substrates, highlighting its versatility. The patterning displays the superimposed efficiency and self&#8208;indicated quality, leading to superior conductivity (with time&#8208;cost savings of 30.7&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;% in heating&#8208;cooling cycles, and a nearly 90&#8201;% reduction in output resistance). The practical viability of these circuits is further showcased by the assembly of integrated circuits, marking a significant step in expanding LMCs applications beyond laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes.

         <title>Surface&#8208;like NOx Reduction at an Atomically&#8208;Precise Tricopper Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. We report catalytic total denitrification of nitric oxide (NO) at a surface&#8208;like tricopper cluster complex. This process is shown to proceed via an oxygen atom transfer pathway that leverages the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity of the polynuclear core. Stoichiometric deoxygenation of nitrite and nitrate are also demonstrated, mapping out the complete denitrification cycle.







Abstract
The combustion of nitrogen&#8208;containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen&#8208;rich fertilizers is accumulating NOx pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NOx remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface. Starting from a molecular tricuprous &#956;3&#8208;oxo complex (1), an unusually reduced and highly reactive surface&#8208;like cluster (2) has been prepared.

     alt="Surface-like NOx Reduction at an Atomically-Precise Tricopper Cluster"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert text for Table of Contents here. We report catalytic total denitrification of nitric oxide (NO) at a surface-like tricopper cluster complex. This process is shown to proceed via an oxygen atom transfer pathway that leverages the metal-metal cooperativity of the polynuclear core. Stoichiometric deoxygenation of nitrite and nitrate are also demonstrated, mapping out the complete denitrification cycle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combustion of nitrogen-containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers is accumulating NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond-making and bond-breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface. Starting from a molecular tricuprous &#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-oxo complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), an unusually reduced and highly reactive surface-like cluster (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) has been prepared. Characterization data and electronic structure calculations are consistent with &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; featuring &#963;-aromaticity that primes the tricopper core for two-electron chemistry. Cluster &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; mediates catalytic reductive coupling of NO to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, proceeding through N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, via sequential oxygen atom transfer steps. Stoichiometric reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is also disclosed, mapping the complete denitrification cycle at an atomically-precise molecular cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Ultralong Phosphorescence and Optical Waveguiding Switches in Silver&#8211;Organic Complex via Reversible Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light&#8208;emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)&#8208;organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Ag+ ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag&#8208;based complex displays reversible solvent&#8208;responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent&#8208;mediated single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color&#8208;tunable active optical waveguides and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polarization switching. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for creating dynamically controllable ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic complexes and advances the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive 1D photonic systems for promising information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8208;Pt bridge site&#8594; Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Atomic&#8208;level designed electrocatalysts, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts, have attracted extensive interests due to their maximized atom utilization efficiency and increased activity. Herein, a new electrocatalyst system termed as &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221;, that marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, was proposed. In atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst, single&#8208;atom MNx and local carbon defects formed under a specific thermodynamic condition, act synergistically to achieve high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency. This symbiotic&#8208;catalyst shows greater structural precision and preparation accessibility than those of dual&#8208;atom catalysts owing to its reduced complexity in chemical space. Meanwhile, it outperforms the intrinsic activities of conventional single&#8208;atom catalysts due to multi&#8208;active&#8208;sites synergistic effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom MnN4 moieties and abundant sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon defects was constructed for low&#8208;temperature zinc&#8208;air battery, which exhibited a high peak power density of 76 mW cm&#8208;2 with long&#8208;term stability at &#8208;40 &#8451;, representing a top&#8208;level performance of such batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;bromine Battery with Highly Reversible Bromine Conversion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Br2/Br conversion reaction with a high operating potential (1.85 V vs. Zn2+/Zn) is promising for designing high&#8208;energy cathode in aqueous Zn batteries. However, the ultrahigh solubility of polybromides causes significant shuttle effects, capacity deterioration, and self&#8208;discharge, rendering the study of static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries in infant stage. Here, various aqueous zinc salt electrolytes are first screened, showing that compared to other salts, ZnSO4 is more suitable for Br&#8208;based cathodes benefiting from its higher negative charge density and lower cost. Nevertheless, the significant shuttle effect of polybromides remains in such electrolyte. We further develop a targeted sequestration strategy to fundamentally confine polybromides migration from KBr cathode into electrolyte. In the high&#8208;mass loading (22 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) pouch cells, the average Coulombic efficiency enhances from 92.3% to 99.8%, and self&#8208;discharge performance dramatically improves from 17.4% capacity retention to 85.2% after 72 h of resting, indicating the effectiveness of our strategy in confining the shuttle effects. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell delivers an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.88% and a zinc utilization of 22% at a high rate of 3 C. Our findings also pave a pathway for the design of advanced Br&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4 mAh cm&#8208;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average Coulombic efficiency (over 99.90%).

         <title>Crystallization Modulation and Comprehensive Defect Passivation by Carbonyl Functionalized Spacer Cation towards High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inverted cesium/formamidinium (CsFA)&#8208;based methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells possess great potential in simultaneously realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent stability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization process and poor film quality hinder further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, we propose a synergistic modulation strategy of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. L&#8208;Alanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (L&#8208;ABEHCl) containing carbonyl functionalized ammonium cation is incorporated into perovskite precursor solution, increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the crystal growth rate because of its strong interaction with precursor components, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. No 2D perovskite is formed for L&#8208;ABEHCl as additive whereas 2D perovskite is formed upon L&#8208;ABEHCl post&#8208;treatment. The L&#8208;ABEHCl passivates defects at GBs in the form of organic salts and passivates interface defects in the form of 2D perovskite. Consequently, the inverted devices using synergistic modulation strategy achieve a maximum PCE of 25.77% (certified stabilized PCE of 25.59%), which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported based on vacuum flash evaporation method. The unencapsulated target device maintains 90.85% of its initial PCE after 2300 h of continuous maximum power point tracking.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating&#8208;Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic dinitrogen reduction reaction under ambient conditions offers a promising approach for sustainable and decentralized green ammonia production. Conventionally, the general understanding on the reaction path is that the N2 reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N2 activation and selective NH3 production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; hybrid pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH + NH3&#8221; step to boost NH3 synthesis with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;product formation for guaranteeing high NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency. Such &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; hybrid pathway was validated by a set of in situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations. In a neutral media, an average ammonia production rate of 82.8 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 37.3 % were attained on the amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst at a mild potential of &#8722;0.2 V, along with an impressive durability of over 40 hours. This work validated an unconventional mechanism in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, which might be extended to other catalytic process with multiple possible reaction paths.</dc:description>

         <title>Twist and Shine: Ultra&#8208;Narrow Red Emission from Nitrogen and Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes, known for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have garnered significant interest for their tunable electronic structures, particularly through heteroatom doping. Herein, we report the synthesis of two twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes (h&#8208;NGs) co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen via a three&#8208;step strategy, where the tandem Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization and ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution serve as a key step. Both h&#8208;NGs incorporate a unique bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene (BFDAC) core, with one further extending the &#960;&#8208;system via peri&#8208;fusion of four benzopyran units. Single&#8208;crystal analyses reveal that BFDAC core of both h&#8208;NGs adopts a highly twisted geometry, whereas the benzopyran&#8208;fused one has enhanced rigidity. Theoretical studies confirm a global aromaticity with 30 &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized along BFDAC periphery. Notably, co&#8208;doping enables precise electronic tuning, with pyridinic nitrogen lowering the LUMO level and benzopyran oxygen raising the HOMO level. Both h&#8208;NGs display the red photoluminescence (PL), and the benzopyran&#8208;fused derivative exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19 nm, among the narrowest reported for organic red&#8208;emitting materials. Both h&#8208;NGs exhibit acid&#8208;responsive optical behavior including near&#8208;infrared absorption shift and PL quenching, providing additional functional versatility.</dc:description>

         <title>Borohydride Oxidation as Counter Reaction in Reductive Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient reaction at the counter electrode is of key importance for the success of net oxidative and net reductive electrochemical transformations. For electrooxidative processes, cathodic proton reduction to H2 serves as the benchmark counter reaction. In contrast, net reductive electrochemical transformations have less attractive oxidative counter reactions to choose from and commonly rely on dissolution of a sacrificial anode that effectively results in stoichiometric metal consumption for the processes. In this study, we demonstrate that anodic borohydride oxidation has great potential to successfully replace the use of such sacrificial anodes for a variety of electroreductive organic transformations. This anodic transformation effectively serves as the inverse of cathodic proton reduction, producing H2 using inert carbon&#8208;based electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Repurposing Post&#8208;consumer Polyethylene to Access Cross&#8208;linked Polyethylene with Reprocessability, Recyclability, and Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced plastic but accumulation and resistance to degradation has significantly contributed to the plastic waste crisis. Upcycling has presented promising solutions to transform PE waste into value&#8208;added products. Herein, mixed post&#8208;consumer PE was successfully repurposed into reprocessable and chemically recyclable cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE). This process involved converting PE into telechelic oligomers, followed by repolymerization using a hybrid cross&#8208;linking system consisting of a dynamic cross&#8208;linker 2,4,6&#8208;triethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TETA) and non&#8208;dynamic cross&#8208;linker tris(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)isocyanurate (Tri&#8208;HDI). In the resulting XLPE, TETA facilitated iterative reprocessing with minimal property degradation across cycles, while Tri&#8208;HDI helped preserve functional performance throughout service life. Compared to PE, XLPE exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, reduced creep deformation under application&#8208;relevant temperatures, and high temperature structural stability. Notably, copolymerizing PE oligomers with commercial macrodiols was employed to create composite XLPEs, enabling tuning material properties. After use, XLPE can be efficiently and selectively depolymerized under mild conditions, even when mixed with commercial insulator cables. This depolymerization allows for the recovery of the constituent building blocks, enabling purification and subsequent repolymerization for reuse. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing plastic waste into sustainable materials and fostering the development of a circular economy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ionogels from Dynamic Polyrotaxane&#8208;based Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The swelling of a polymer matrix by ionic liquids and additional lithium salts may lead to the formation of ionogel electrolytes. However, the introduction of additional ions usually results in a decreased lithium&#8208;ion transference number, because of the trapping of the lithium ions in clusters and polymer&#8208;ion complexes. Achieving highly efficient lithium&#8208;ion migration and increasing lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium&#8208;ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and tLi+=0.45 at 20 &#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium&#8208;lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000 hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20 &#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03%).</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Short Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network Enhancing Hydrophilicity in Biomimetic Membranes with Artificial Water Channels for Efficient Removal of Dyes and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an integrated biomimetic membrane capable of rejecting both dyes and salts in a single step, while sustaining stable water permeation, presents a promising solution for textile wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a novel integrated biomimetic membrane integrating an I&#8208;quartet artificial water channel (AWC) with sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide (PA&#8208;SO&#8323;H), which can stably reject both dyes and inorganic salts. The I&#8208;quartet channels (2.68 &#197;), formed via self&#8208;assembly of alkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole (HC8) molecules, facilitate selective water transport and rejection of both dyes and inorganic salts. Concurrently, the sulfonic acid groups (&#8208;SO&#8323;H) could grab water molecules, forming dynamic short hydrogen&#8208;bonding network (O&#8213;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O). These hydrogen bonds not only serve as jumping force, lowering the energy barrier for water transport through the alternating hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic matrix, but also act as an effective antifouling barrier, significantly reducing membrane fouling. The optimal HC83.0&#8208;PA&#8208;SO&#8323;H membrane exhibits a water permeance of 13.4 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 MPa&#8208;1, approximately 2.7&#8208;fold higher than that of the pristine PA membrane, and both high dyes and salts rejection efficiency. Moreover, the membrane sustains stable antifouling characteristics throughout a 19&#8208;day endurance test. This innovative membrane design provides a promising solution for the efficient separation of both dyes and inorganic salts in textile wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Dynamics of Interpenetrated Porous Frameworks for Inverse C2H6/C2H4 Separation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective adsorption of ethane (C2H6) from mixtures containing ethylene (C2H4) is of interest for the direct production of high purity C2H4. However, the extremely similar molecular properties of these gases make this process challenging, particularly at elevated temperatures, an implication of saved energy consumption. To address such challenge, we present a new approach for regulating the temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics in hydrogen&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks. As a single H&#8208;bond linked interpenetrated porous framework, NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 exhibits emerging structural dynamics in response to C2H6 (37 kPa) and C2H4 (53 kPa) and has shown a record ability to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (15.7 mL g&#8208;1) at 328 K, as the shifting of the interpenetrated frameworks here requires a relatively weak stimulus, allowing the optimization of adsorption at a higher temperatures range. Meanwhile, the robust and conveniently prepared NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 shows good cyclic separation performance. In comparison, the framework response of the percussor NTU&#8208;101, connected by three H&#8208;bonds, occurs at 293 K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2 mL g&#8208;1). This work showcases the first adsorbent for direct C2H4 purification at elevated temperatures, and the insights into the hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks will pave the way for designing soft families capable of challenging separations with reduced energy requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Triple&#8208;Atom Sites Combined with Oxygen Vacancy for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Propionic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon products is an emerging approach for achieving carbon neutrality; however, the design of active sites that effectively promote multistep C&#8208;C coupling remains a challenge. Here, we propose a straightforward defect engineering approach to construct asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (named CWO&#8208;OVs). The optimized CWO&#8208;OVs achieve a photochemical synthesis rate of propionic acid (C3H6O2, PA) of 86.46 &#177; 2.92 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with an electron&#8208;based selectivity of 89.27%, which exhibits a remarkable advantage in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations corroborate the prominent role of OVs in inducing the triple&#8208;atom sites: (1) the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+ triggers the first step of C1&#8208;C1 coupling to form *CH2CH3; (2) Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+ facilitates subsequent C2&#8208;C1 bonding, ultimately leading to PA production. This charge&#8208;asymmetric cascade reaction system offers new insights into the design of efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, using L/D&#8208;cysteine&#8211;threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods with a g&#8208;factor of 0.026 at 724 nm. These had a distinct spiral four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating &#8220;hot spots&#8221; that produced a potent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The L&#8208;Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly two&#8208;fold stronger SERS response to A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils than the D&#8208;Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the L&#8208;Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical CSF samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the A&#946;42/A&#946;40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD, with a cut&#8208;off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hollowed&#8208;Out Heterometallic Cluster for Catalytic Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural lanthanide&#8208;nickel clusters Ln132Ni78 (Ln=Gd, Eu) were synthesized by the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ln3+ and Ni2+ in the presence of iminodiacetate. Both clusters feature a hollow truncated tetrahedral structure with trumpet&#8208;shaped passageways that connect the exterior and the interior of the cluster cage. The solution&#8208;stable cluster has been shown to catalyze size&#8208;selective Knoevenagel condensation and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;containing clusters are synthetically challenging and with significant chemical and materials applications. Herein, two isostructural heterometallic clusters of the formula (NO3)12@[Ln132Ni78(OH)292(IDA)48(CH3COO)96(NO3)12(H2O)78]Cl44&#8901;xH2O&#8901;yCH3OH (IDA=iminodiacetate; Ln=Gd 1, x=110, y=0; Ln=Eu 2, x=95, y=40) were obtained via co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ln3+ (Gd3+ or Eu3+) and Ni2+ in the presence of iminodiacetate (IDA). Crystallographic studies show that each features a truncated tetrahedral core of Ln132Ni78 within which a void of 1.1&#8197;nm in diameter; connecting the central cage and its exterior are four trumpet&#8208;like passageways surface&#8208;decorated with dinuclear units of [Gd(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2Gd]. Mass spectroscopic analyses indicate that both clusters maintained their structural integrity in aqueous solution, with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy providing the most convincing visual evidence in support of the cluster&#8216;s solution stability. Size&#8208;selective Knoevenagel condensation, believed to occur in the passageways on the basis of experimental and molecular modeling results, was achieved in the presence of 1. The application of 1 as a uniquely structured molecular reactor and a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst was further illustrated by the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically significant 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Two isostructural lanthanide-nickel clusters Ln&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt; (Ln=Gd, Eu) were synthesized by the co-hydrolysis of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of iminodiacetate. Both clusters feature a hollow truncated tetrahedral structure with trumpet-shaped passageways that connect the exterior and the interior of the cluster cage. The solution-stable cluster has been shown to catalyze size-selective Knoevenagel condensation and one-pot three-component synthesis of 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyran derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanthanide-containing clusters are synthetically challenging and with significant chemical and materials applications. Herein, two isostructural heterometallic clusters of the formula (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;@[Ln&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;292&lt;/sub&gt;(IDA)&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;96&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8901;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH (IDA=iminodiacetate; Ln=Gd &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=110, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;=0; Ln=Eu &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=95, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;=40) were obtained via co-hydrolysis of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of iminodiacetate (IDA). Crystallographic studies show that each features a truncated tetrahedral core of Ln&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;78&lt;/sub&gt; within which a void of 1.1&#8197;nm in diameter; connecting the central cage and its exterior are four trumpet-like passageways surface-decorated with dinuclear units of [Gd(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Gd]. Mass spectroscopic analyses indicate that both clusters maintained their structural integrity in aqueous solution, with cryo-electron microscopy providing the most convincing visual evidence in support of the cluster&#8216;s solution stability. Size-selective Knoevenagel condensation, believed to occur in the passageways on the basis of experimental and molecular modeling results, was achieved in the presence of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The application of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; as a uniquely structured molecular reactor and a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst was further illustrated by the one-pot three-component synthesis of biologically and pharmaceutically significant 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyran derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking HFIP for Fluoroalkylation with Molecular Photoelectrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofluorine compounds bearing the hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate fluoroalkylation reagents. Herein we report a molecular photoelectrocatalysis method for the C&#8722;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent.







Abstract
Despite the increasing interest in radical&#8208;based fluoroalkylation techniques, the organofluorine compounds bearing the partially fluorinated hexafluoroisopropyl group remain extremely scarce due to the lack of appropriate reagents. Herein we report an unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic method for the C&#8722;H hexafluoroisopropylation of indoles and tryptophan peptides, utilizing the readily available hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) as the fluoroalkylation reagent. In this process, HFIP is converted into hexafluoroisopropyl radicals, enabling fluoroalkylation reactions. This study broadens the potential applications of molecular photoelectrocatalysis, highlighting its capacity to enable transformations that are difficult to accomplish through traditional electrochemical or photochemical approaches.

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>

Thermoplastic elastomers: Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene, ethylene butadiene rubber and highly crystalline polyethylene segments are prepared using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization. They display low&#8208;viscosity above the melting point of PE and high elastic performances upon crystallization of PE segments.







Abstract
Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt;150&#8201;&#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions on Functionalized Porous Aromatic Cages for Gold Recovery from Complex Aqueous with High Capacity</title>

         <dc:description>
Preparation of a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for efficient high&#8208;capacity gold recovery. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner. The theoretical calculations and dedicated experiments suggest that anion&#8208;&#960; interactions between the [AuCl4]&#8722; and TFP fractions on T&#8208;PAC cooperated with S/N boning and redox effects play the decisive role for the highly efficient gold&#8208;recovery performance.







Abstract
High capacity, selective recovery and separation of precious metals from complex aqueous solutions is essential but remains a challenge in practical applications. Here, we prepared a thiophene&#8208;modified aromatic porous organic cage (T&#8208;PAC) with high stability for precise recognition and recovery of gold. T&#8208;PAC exhibits an outstanding gold uptake capacity of up to 2260&#8197;mg/g with fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption selectivity. It's also used to selectively recover gold from a variety of complex aqueous solutions in a stable and efficient manner. The theoretical calculations and dedicated experiments suggest that anion&#8208;&#960; interactions between the [AuCl4]&#8722; and TFP fractions on T&#8208;PAC cooperated with S/N boning and redox effects play the decisive role in the highly efficient gold recovery performance.

         <title>Multiple Structural and Phase Transformations of MOF and Selective Hydrocarbon Gas Separation in its Amorphous, Glass Phase States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiple structure transformation and phase evolution within MOF provide a vivid example showing the diverse MOF dynamic chemistry under both room and high temperature. The generated disordered hierarchical pores in amorphous and glassy MOFs different to the crystalline precursor, contributes to efficient separation of either C2H2/C2H4 or C3H6/C3H8 gases mixture for the first time in breakthrough experiments.







Abstract
The first wide&#8208;view image of multiple structural and phase transformations for MOFs, ranging from crystal state transformations to the extreme limit approaching liquid/glass phase, was presented. The process involves i) an initial crystalline transformation from square&#8208;layer framework [Co2(pybz)2(CH3COO)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (Co2) to a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated and ordered vacancies contained framework [Co(pybz)2(CH3OH)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH (CoM) due to in situ disassemble&#8208;reassemble, ii) thermal induced departure of a pair of cis&#8208;form coordinated methanol in CoM leads to amorphous framework a&#8208;dCoM, iii) glass transition to super&#8208;cooled liquid scl&#8208;dCoM, iv) obtaining MOF glass g&#8208;dCoM upon quenching the super&#8208;cooled liquid, and v) re&#8208;crystallization of super&#8208;cooled liquid generates 6&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia&#8208;net framework [Co(pybz)2]6n (rec&#8208;dCoM) under further heating. The access to glass from CoM, provides a new self&#8208;perturbation strategy to create MOF glasses without melting. The wider pore size distribution in amorphous/glassy MOFs than crystalline precursor achieved the first time selective hydrocarbon gas separation by breakthrough experiments, which bring efficient separation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;99&#8197;C2H2/C2H4 by either a&#8208;dCoM or g&#8208;dCoM and produce polymer grade C2H4 with purity&#8805;99.5&#8201;% after a single adsorption process. Furthermore, the mixture of 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;C3H6/C3H8 can be separated by a&#8208;dCoM.

The generated disordered hierarchical pores in amorphous and glassy MOFs different to the crystalline precursor, contributes to efficient separation of either C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; gases mixture for the first time in breakthrough experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first wide-view image of multiple structural and phase transformations for MOFs, ranging from crystal state transformations to the extreme limit approaching liquid/glass phase, was presented. The process involves i) an initial crystalline transformation from &lt;i&gt;square-&lt;/i&gt;layer framework [Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(pybz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (&lt;b&gt;Co2&lt;/b&gt;) to a 3-fold interpenetrated and ordered vacancies contained framework [Co(pybz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH (&lt;b&gt;CoM&lt;/b&gt;) due to in situ disassemble-reassemble, ii) thermal induced departure of a pair of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-form coordinated methanol in &lt;b&gt;CoM&lt;/b&gt; leads to amorphous framework &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt;, iii) glass transition to super-cooled liquid &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;scl&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt;, iv) obtaining MOF glass &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt; upon quenching the super-cooled liquid, and v) re-crystallization of super-cooled liquid generates 6-fold interpenetrated &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;dia&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;net framework [Co(pybz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;rec&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt;) under further heating. The access to glass from &lt;b&gt;CoM&lt;/b&gt;, provides a new self-perturbation strategy to create MOF glasses without melting. The wider pore size distribution in amorphous/glassy MOFs than crystalline precursor achieved the first time selective hydrocarbon gas separation by breakthrough experiments, which bring efficient separation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;99&#8197;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by either &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt; and produce polymer grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with purity&#8805;99.5&#8201;% after a single adsorption process. Furthermore, the mixture of 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; can be separated by &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-dCoM&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Controlled Protein Switches: Development and In Vitro and In Vivo Applications</title>

Engineering artificial allosteric protein switches controlled by rare earth elements allows the development of assays, construction of bioelectronic devices, and REE&#8208;controlled microorganisms.







Abstract
Lanthanides, which are part of the rare earth elements group have numerous applications in electronics, medicine and energy storage. However, our ability to extract them is not meeting the rapidly increasing demand. The discovery of the bacterial periplasmic lanthanide&#8208;binding protein lanmodulin spurred significant interest in developing biotechnological routes for lanthanide detection and extraction. Here we report the construction of &#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;lanmodulin chimeras that function as lanthanide&#8208;controlled enzymatic switches. Optimized switches demonstrated dynamic ranges approaching 3000&#8208;fold and could accurately quantify lanthanide ions in simple colorimetric or electrochemical assays. E.coli cells expressing such chimeras grow on &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics only in the presence of lanthanide ions. The developed lanthanide&#8208;controlled protein switches represent a novel platform for engineering metal&#8208;binding proteins for biosensing and microbial engineering.

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinel oxide, Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen is developed by high&#8208;throughput methods. The lattice oxygen activation is facilitated by Cr oxidation (Cr3+&#8594;Cr6+), accompanied by cation migration from octahedral to tetrahedral sites. This geometric conversion generates oxygen non&#8208;bonding states essential for lattice oxygen oxidation. Oxidized oxygen species are stabilized through dimerization with CrO4 tetrahedra (d0 Cr6+). The oxide demonstrates high activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with outstanding stability for over 170&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6 octahedrons to CrO4 tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non&#8208;bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8722;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.

We demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based organic spacer cations. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and use them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior performances and enhanced operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptional potential in converting solar energy to electric power in photovoltaics, yet their application is hampered by limited operational stability. This stimulated the development of hybrid layered (two&#8208;dimensional, 2D) halide perovskites based on hydrophobic organic spacers, templating perovskite slabs, as a more stable alternative. However, conventional organic spacer cations are electronically insulating, resulting in charge confinement within the inorganic slabs, thus limiting their functionality. This can be ameliorated by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the spacer cations. We demonstrate the capacity to access Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper and Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskites incorporating for the first time aryl&#8208;acetylene&#8208;based (4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methylammonium (BMAA) and buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylbis(4,1&#8208;phenylene)dimethylammonium (BDAA) spacers, respectively. We assess their unique opto(electro)ionic characteristics by a combination of techniques and apply them in mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells that show superior device performances with a power conversion efficiency of up to 23&#8201;% and higher operational stability, opening the way for multifunctionality in layered hybrid materials and their application.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced G&#8208;Quartets: Robust Supramolecular Polymers Exhibiting Heating&#8208;Induced Aqueous Phase Transitions Into Gel or Precipitate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) forms robust, thermoset, and redox&#8208;responsive G&#8208;quadruplex (G4.Cu+) supramolecular polymers (SPs) through unique metallophilic interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic forces. Interestingly, these SPs undergo aqueous phase transitions into a hydrogel via slow dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking below the cloud temperature (Tcp) and fast, complete dehydration into a solid precipitate above Tcp, exhibiting LCST behavior.







Abstract
Certain proteins and synthetic covalent polymers experience aqueous phase transitions, driving functional self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we unveil the ability of supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by G4.Cu+ to undergo heating&#8208;induced unexpected aqueous phase transitions. For the first time, guided by Cu+, guanosine (G) formed a highly stable G&#8208;quartet (G4.Cu+)/G&#8208;quadruplex as a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure with temperature tolerance, distinct from the well&#8208;known G4.K+. The G4.Cu+ self&#8208;assembled in water through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, metallophilic and hydrophobic interactions, forming thermally robust SPs. This enhanced stability is attributed to the stronger coordination of Cu+ to four carbonyl oxygens of G&#8208;quartet and the presence of Cu+&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Cu+ attractive metallophilic interactions in Cu+&#8208;induced G&#8208;quadruplex, exhibiting a significantly higher interaction energy than K+ as determined computationally. Remarkably, the aqueous SP solution exhibited heating&#8208;induced phase transitions&#8212;forming a hydrogel through dehydration&#8208;driven crosslinking of SPs below cloud temperature (Tcp) and a hydrophobic collapse&#8208;induced solid precipitate above Tcp, showcasing a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. Notably, this LCST behavior of G4.Cu+ SP originates from biomolecular functionality rather than commonly exploited thermo&#8208;responsive oligoethylene glycols with supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, exploiting the redox reversibility of Cu+/Cu2+, we demonstrated control over the assembly and disassembly of G&#8208;quartets/G&#8208;quadruplex and gelation reversibly.

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>

TOC illustrates an approach to hydrogen release using low&#8208;load Pt on ALD&#8208;TiO2&#8208;modified &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 pellets for the dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), such as methylcyclohexane and hydrogenated biphenyl/diphenylmethane mixture. The cost&#8208;efficient catalytic reactor is crucial for LOHC import scenarios, enabling effective hydrogen storage, release and transport within existing infrastructure.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.

         <title>Optimization of Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemical Probes for the Pseudoknot RNA of the Frameshift Element in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>

The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 frameshift element pseudoknot plays a crucial role in viral replication. Using various techniques, especially NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vitro frameshift assays, we have developed and optimized chemical probes that serve as fundamental structures for potential inhibitors targeting viral RNAs.







Abstract
Targeting the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a viable option for antiviral drug development. We explored three ligand binding sites of the core pseudoknot RNA of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 frameshift element. We iteratively optimized ligands, based on improved affinities, targeting these binding sites and report on structural and dynamic properties of the three identified binding sites. Available experimental 3D structures of the pseudoknot element were compared to SAXS and NMR data to validate its dominant folding state in solution. In order to experimentally map in&#8197;silico predicted binding sites, NMR assignments of the majority of nucleobases were achieved by segmental labeling of the pseudoknot RNA and isotope&#8208;filtered NMR experiments at 1.2&#8197;GHz, demonstrating the value of NMR spectroscopy to supplement modelling and docking data. Optimized ligands with enhanced affinity were shown to specifically inhibit frameshifting without affecting 0&#8208;frame translation in cell&#8208;free translation assays, establishing the frameshift element as target for drug&#8208;like ligands of low molecular weight.

         <title>Dynamic, Single&#8208;cell Monitoring of RNA Modifications Response to Viral Infection Using a Genetically Encoded Live&#8208;cell RNA Methylation Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor allowing for dynamically monitoring of RNA m6A modification at single&#8208;cell resolution is reported, and has been used to elucidate the interaction between host&#8208;cell RNA modifications and the infection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants.







Abstract
RNA modifications, such as N6&#8208;methylation of adenosine (m6A), serve as key regulators of cellular behaviors, and are highly dynamic; however, tools for dynamic monitoring of RNA modifications in live cells are lacking. Here, we develop a genetically encoded live&#8208;cell RNA methylation sensor that can dynamically monitor RNA m6A level at single&#8208;cell resolution. The sensor senses RNA m6A in cells via affinity&#8208;induced cytoplasmic retention using a nuclear location sequence&#8208;fused m6A reader. It allows for simultaneously measure RNA m6A dynamics and viral invasion at single&#8208;cell level. Based on the single&#8208;cell analytical tool, we found that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection enhances host&#8208;cell RNA m6A level, and high&#8208;level RNA m6A modification in host cells, in turn, facilitates viral infection. Particularly, Omicron, a variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, that features as high infection capacity, however, exhibits a reduced facilitation of m6A modification in host cells. In addition, the sensor can estimate viral inhibition via measuring cellular m6A level, that was explored for screening potential antiviral drugs. The methylation sensor can serve for elucidating the interplay between pathogens and host&#8208;cell epigenetics at single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Nanocrystals with Aggregate Anionic Structure Enable Ion Transport Decoupling of Chain Segment Movement in Poly(ethylene oxide) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike classical poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes, single ion conductors, and crystalline polymers, this work discovered a novel ion transport mechanism mediated by PEO3: LiBF4 nanocrystals with aggregate anionic structure, which decouples the movement of PEO segments. The ultra&#8208;thin PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte exhibits balanced ion conductivity, Li+ transference number, and mechanical strength, extending the life of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes are promising for lithium batteries, but Li+ transport in these electrolytes relies on amorphous chain segment movement, leading to low Li+ mobility and poor mechanical strength. Here we propose a novel Li+ transport mechanism mediated by PEO3:LiBF4 nanocrystals (NCPB) with the aggregate (AGG) anionic structure, which enables a change from amorphous to crystalline phase dominated ion transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte. Experiments and simulations reveal that the interaction between Li+ and F in NCPB with AGG anionic structure simultaneously restricts anion transport and reorients anions within the free volume of NCPB, resulting in a three&#8208;coordination intermediate to facilitate Li+ transport. The unique Li+ transport mechanism through NCPB makes the PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte with a high Li+ transference number (0.73) and remarkably increased mechanical strength (storage modulus &gt;100&#8197;MPa) at 45&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, the Li|LiFePO4 batteries with the ultrathin self&#8208;supported PEO/LiBF4 electrolyte (10&#8197;&#956;m) exhibit significantly improved cycle life (97&#8201;% @ 468 cycles) compared to those with PEO/LiTFSI electrolyte (failed @ 68 cycles). This work demonstrates a novel ion transport mechanism for achieving selective and rapid Li+ transport.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike classical poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes, single ion conductors, and crystalline polymers, this work discovered a novel ion transport mechanism mediated by PEO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: LiBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals with aggregate anionic structure, which decouples the movement of PEO segments. The ultra-thin PEO/LiBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte exhibits balanced ion conductivity, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number, and mechanical strength, extending the life of all-solid-state batteries.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polyglycerol Nanogels for Periodontitis Treatment through Antibacterial and Pro&#8208;Angiogenesis Action</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex is armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO). Upon pH&#8208;stimuli, the complex can disintegrate and release the TCS and DFO in situ. By promoting tissue regeneration while eliminating microbial pathogens, the nanogel complex can effectively treat persistent periodontitis.







Abstract
Periodontitis is a microbe&#8208;driven inflammatory disease leading to bone resorption and tissue destruction. We propose a dual&#8208;functional nanogel complex armed with the antimicrobial drug triclosan (TCS) and the pro&#8208;angiogenesis medication deferoxamine (DFO) for combating microbial pathogens and promoting tissue regeneration. The nanogel system (NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO) that we fabricated from linear polyglycerol exhibits well&#8208;defined spherical morphology and a positively charged surface for bacteria adhesion. The rapid and sustained degradation of NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO in the acidic environment of an infection site induces the on&#8208;demand release of TCS and DFO. The NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO shows potent bacteria elimination of the gingivitis&#8208;causing bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis in both planktonic (99.9&#8201;%) and biofilm (99&#8201;%) states. Furthermore, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO can promote vascularization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Contributing to the synergistic effect of TCS and DFO, the NG&#8208;TCS&#8208;DFO demonstrates significant bone tissue regeneration and accelerated healing of periodontitis in vivo. This polyglycerol&#8208;based nanogel may therefore offer smart combined delivery of multiple therapeutics against bacteria&#8208;driven diseases.

         <title>A Highly Dispersed Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalyst for Efficient Domino Hydroformylation Reductive Amination of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly dispersed Co&#8722;N/C catalyst has been developed for the efficient hydroaminomethylation of alkenes using CO and H2. This heterogeneous catalyst enables the synthesis of a broad range of secondary and tertiary amines, including pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The catalyst shows excellent activity, reusability, and scale&#8208;up potential, offering a green and cost&#8208;effective alternative to noble metal catalysts for amine synthesis.







Abstract
The hydroaminomethylation of alkenes using CO and H2 proceeds efficiently in the presence of a heterogeneous Co&#8722;N/C catalyst with highly dispersed metal centers. Various secondary and tertiary amines can be effectively synthesized from cyclic and linear aliphatic alkenes using this specific material. The active sites of the optimal catalyst result from the synergistic effect of atomically dispersed Co sites with their surrounding N atoms, and the high surface area as well as structural defects of the NC support. The broad applicability (&gt;54 examples), including pharmaceutically relevant molecules, together with the high activity and reusability, underline the general applicability of this catalytic system.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizer Prodrug for Self&#8208;Amplified Immune Therapy Via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work proposes a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for tumors and reports the first activatable photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis. Unlike existing combination therapies, HDIM demonstrates a significantly enhanced synergistic and cascading anti&#8208;tumor effect. Using HDIM, systemic immune activity is successfully remodeled to prevent tumor infiltration and metastasis.







Abstract
Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment, but its application is hindered by tumors&#8217; low immunogenicity and the difficulty of immune cell infiltration. Here, to address above issues and achieve targeted tumor treatment, we designed the first activated small molecule photosensitizer immune&#8208;prodrug HDIM based on pyroptosis, and proposed a self&#8208;amplified immune therapy strategy (SITS) for enhanced tumor therapy. HDIM can be specifically activated by the tumor hypoxia and then simultaneously initiate immuno&#8208;therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;induced pyroptosis with NIR laser irradiation. Mechanism study demonstrated that the immunogenicity in tumor can be significantly enhanced by HDIM&#8208;induced pyroptosis and immune cells are recruited, thus effectively amplifying the therapeutic effect of the released immune drugs. As proof of application, we have utilized HDIM for primary tumor and distant tumor therapy. And the experiment results showed that compared to current monotherapy as well as simple combination therapy, the photosensitizer prodrug HDIM exhibited much superior tumor treatment effect owing to its synchronous activation of pyroptosis and immuno&#8208;therapy in tumor.

         <title>Converting Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;atom Catalyst to a New FeNxSey Cluster Catalyst for Proton&#8208;exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

This work successfully converts Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to an entirely new Fennessey cluster catalyst, which is highly active, selective, and strong H2O2&#8208;tolerance for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) single&#8208;atom catalyst is the most promising alternative to platinum catalyst for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however its high performance cannot be maintained for a long enough time in device operation. The construction of a new Fe coordination environment that is completely different from the square&#8208;planar Fe&#8722;N4 configuration in classic Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst is expected to break the current stability limits of Pt&#8208;free catalysts, which however remains unexplored. Here, we report, for the first time, the conversion of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to a new FeNxSey cluster catalyst, where the active Fe sites are three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) co&#8208;coordinated by N and Se atoms. Due to this unique Fe coordination configuration, the FeNxSey catalyst exhibits much better 4e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Specifically, the yields of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and &#8901;OH radicals on the FeNxSey catalyst are only one&#8208;quarter and one&#8208;third of that on the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart, respectively. Therefore, the FeNxSey catalyst exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, losing only 10&#8197;mV in half&#8208;wave potential E1/2 after 10,000 potential cycles, much smaller than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst (56&#8197;mV), representing the most stable Pt&#8208;free catalysts ever reported for PEMFCs. More significantly, the 3D co&#8208;coordination structure effectively inhibits the Fe demetallization of the FeNxSey catalyst in the presence of H2O2. As a result, the FeNxSey based PEMFC shows excellent durability, with the current density attenuation significantly lower than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C based device after accelerated durability testing. Our work provides guidance for the development of next&#8208;generation Pt&#8208;free catalysts for PEMFCs.

&lt;p&gt;Iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) single-atom catalyst is the most promising alternative to platinum catalyst for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), however its high performance cannot be maintained for a long enough time in device operation. The construction of a new Fe coordination environment that is completely different from the square-planar Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration in classic Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst is expected to break the current stability limits of Pt-free catalysts, which however remains unexplored. Here, we report, for the first time, the conversion of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst to a new FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; cluster catalyst, where the active Fe sites are three-dimensionally (3D) co-coordinated by N and Se atoms. Due to this unique Fe coordination configuration, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits much better 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR activity and selectivity than the state-of-the-art Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Specifically, the yields of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and &#8901;OH radicals on the FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst are only one-quarter and one-third of that on the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart, respectively. Therefore, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, losing only 10&#8197;mV in half-wave potential &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; after 10,000 potential cycles, much smaller than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst (56&#8197;mV), representing the most stable Pt-free catalysts ever reported for PEMFCs. More significantly, the 3D co-coordination structure effectively inhibits the Fe demetallization of the FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; based PEMFC shows excellent durability, with the current density attenuation significantly lower than that of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C based device after accelerated durability testing. Our work provides guidance for the development of next-generation Pt-free catalysts for PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Multi&#8208;Center&#8208;2&#8208;Electron Bonds for Carbene Metal&#8208;Hydride Nanocluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up approach leveraging preexisting m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds enables the synthesis of a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8208;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2. With superior stability to Stryker's reagent, DFT calculations attribute this stability to hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with &#960;&#8208;accepting carbenes. This bench&#8208;stable cluster serves as an efficient and selective copper&#8208;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst in several catalytic applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands possess the ability to stabilize metal&#8208;based nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. With respect to metal&#8208;hydride nanomaterials, however, carbenes are rare, which is surprising if one considers the importance of metal&#8208;hydride bonds across the chemical sciences. In this study, we introduce a bottom&#8208;up approach that leverages preexisting metal&#8208;metal m&#8208;center&#8208;n&#8208;electron (mc&#8208;ne) bonds to access a highly stable cyclic(alkyl)amino carbene (CAAC) copper&#8208;hydride nanocluster, [(CAAC)6Cu14H12][OTf]2 with superior stability compared to Stryker's reagent, a popular commercial phosphine&#8208;based copper hydride catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced stability stems from hydride&#8208;to&#8208;ligand backbonding with the &#960;&#8208;accepting carbene. This new cluster emerges as an efficient and selective copper&#8208;hydride pre&#8208;catalyst, thereby providing a bench&#8208;stable alternative for catalytic applications.

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocyclic Carbenes for Enhanced Stability and Reactivity in Nanoparticle Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for effective surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs) utilizing block copolymers containing nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes blocks and poly(reactive ester) block. This approach enhances NPs&#8242; reactivity and stability, and is applicable to metal, metal oxide, and even rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are emerging as effective substitutes for conventional thiol ligands in surface functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs), offering exceptional stability to NPs under harsh conditions. However, the highly reactive feature of NHCs limits their use in introducing chemically active groups onto the NP surface. Herein, we develop a general yet robust strategy for the efficient surface functionalization of NPs with copolymer ligands bearing various functional groups. The polymer ligands consist of a multiple NHCs block, utilized for surface binding on NPs, alongside a poly(reactive ester) block intended for incorporating functional groups. The multiple NHCs block enables NPs with excellent colloidal stability across a broader range of pH values (0&#8211;14), temperature variations (&#8211;78&#8201;&#176;C&#8208;100&#8201;&#176;C), and electrolyte concentrations (0&#8211;1000&#8197;mM). Through the in situ ammonolysis of the poly(reactive ester) block, various active functional groups can be individually or together introduced on the NP surface. We further demonstrate the chemical reactivity of these functionalized NPs, including addition polymerization, Diels&#8211;Alder and Schiff base reactions. This method is applicable to various types of NPs, including metal NPs, metal oxide NPs, and even upconversion NPs, thereby paving new pathways for the design and creation of nanoparticle&#8208;based functional materials.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Photosensitizers: Cyanine&#8208;Carborane Salts for Superior Photodynamic Therapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multifaceted assessment of novel cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds exhibit efficient tumor targeting through uptake by organic anion&#8208;transporting polypeptides (OATP). Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, cyanine&#8208;carborane salts generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering apoptosis and significantly suppressing tumor cell proliferation and migration. In vivo studies demonstrate anti&#8208;tumor activity with minimal systemic toxicity, highlighting their potential as next&#8208;generation PDT therapeutics.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising targeted treatment for cancer. However, current PDT is limited by low tissue penetration, insufficient phototoxicity (toxicity with light irradiation), and undesirable cytotoxicity (toxicity without light irradiation). Here, we report the discovery of cyanine&#8208;carborane salts as potent photosensitizers (PSs) that harness the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing [cyanine+] with the inertness of [carborane&#8722;]. The implementation of [cyanine+] [carborane&#8722;] salts dramatically enhance cancer targeting of the PSs and decrease cytotoxicity. We characterize the cellular uptake of the cyanine&#8208;carborane PSs, organelle localization, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the ability to cogenerate multiple ROS species, suppression of pro&#8208;metastatic pathways, and activation of apoptotic pathways. We further demonstrate the ability of optimized PSs to eliminate tumors in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. These newly developed [cyanine+] [carborane&#8722;] salt PSs introduce a potent therapeutic approach against aggressive breast cancer while decreasing side effects.

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous and heterogeneous fluorescence with versatile colors were achieved on single crystals of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed bicomponent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with permanent porosity. Focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and microscopic fluorescence spectroscopy on single crystals reveal structure and property relationship.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of multicomponent molecules in a non&#8208;stoichiometric composition have drawn great interest due to their tunable properties. However, the photobehavior of the single crystals of such mixed HOFs has not been explored. Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization and photobehavior of single crystalline non&#8208;stoichiometric HOFs (NS&#8208;HOFs). NS&#8208;HOFs (BTNT&#8208;1) with various composition ratios were successfully obtained as single crystals from two analogue tetratopic carboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores (NTTA and BTTA, respectively). The heterogeneous distribution of the components was thoroughly confirmed by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy and local crystallographic analysis using focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray radiation. The versatile fluorescence of BTNT&#8208;1 behavior depends on the composition ratio and distribution of the component in the single crystals. We observed not only fluorescence bands with various colors such as purple, blue, green and white, depending on the composition ratios, but also different emission bands from a single crystal. We provide details on their emission lifetimes following the composition, emission color and targeted region on the crystal. This work is the first example of single crystal studies applied to organic porous co&#8208;crystals and demonstrates unique and versatile optical properties of carboxylic acid&#8208;based NS&#8208;HOFs.

     alt="Single Crystalline, Non-Stoichiometric Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homogeneous and heterogeneous fluorescence with versatile colors were achieved on single crystals of non-stoichiometrically mixed bicomponent hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks with permanent porosity. Focused synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis and microscopic fluorescence spectroscopy on single crystals reveal structure and property relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of multicomponent molecules in a non-stoichiometric composition have drawn great interest due to their tunable properties. However, the photobehavior of the single crystals of such mixed HOFs has not been explored. Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization and photobehavior of single crystalline non-stoichiometric HOFs (NS-HOFs). NS-HOFs (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;-1&lt;/b&gt;) with various composition ratios were successfully obtained as single crystals from two analogue tetratopic carboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores (&lt;b&gt;NTTA&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BTTA&lt;/b&gt;, respectively). The heterogeneous distribution of the components was thoroughly confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence microscopy and local crystallographic analysis using focused synchrotron X-ray radiation. The versatile fluorescence of &lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;-1&lt;/b&gt; behavior depends on the composition ratio and distribution of the component in the single crystals. We observed not only fluorescence bands with various colors such as purple, blue, green and white, depending on the composition ratios, but also different emission bands from a single crystal. We provide details on their emission lifetimes following the composition, emission color and targeted region on the crystal. This work is the first example of single crystal studies applied to organic porous co-crystals and demonstrates unique and versatile optical properties of carboxylic acid-based NS-HOFs. The results provide a concept of creating functional mixed porous materials capable of different and tunable optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Stepwise Reduction of Aliphatic Carboxylic Esters to Aldehydes and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The method described here unlocks the puzzle of the photochemical reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters by sequential SET/HAT processes under the synergistic action of a phenolate&#8208;type photocatalyst and a thiol catalyst. The stepwise reduction of esters to aldehydes and alcohols under mild conditions provides a practical method for fundamental functional group transformation.







Abstract
The reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes and alcohols is a fundamental functional group transformation in chemistry. However, the inertness of carbonyl group and the instability of ketyl radical anion intermediate impede the reduction of carboxylic esters via photochemical strategy. Herein, we described the reduction of aliphatic carboxylic esters with synergistic dual photocatalysis via phenolate&#8208;catalyzed single electron transfer process and thiol&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer process. The competitive back electron transfer process was effectively inhibited by protonation of the ketyl&#8208;type radical anion. This protocol enabled the efficient reduction of carboxylic esters to alcohols under mild conditions. By interruption of the reduction with prolinol, the step&#8208;controlled reduction of carboxylic esters to aldehydes was accomplished. The developed process was also successfully applied to the preparation of deuterated alcohols and aldehydes from esters with D2O as the deuterium source.

         <title>A Stable Open&#8208;Shelled Au26 Nanocluster with Remarkable Performance in Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable open&#8208;shelled Au26 nanocluster with 15 valence electrons has been synthesized, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by magnetic measurements. This cluster shows high stability and excellent catalytic performance in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, achieving a record high TON of 100670 among atomically precise gold nanoclusters.







Abstract
Open metal sites are crucial in catalysis. We have used a &#8220;loose coordination strategy&#8221; (LCS) to preorganize open metal sites in gold cluster catalysts. A gold nanocluster with composition of [Au26(3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form)9(iPr2&#8208;imy)3(Me2S)](BF4)2 (iPr2&#8208;imy=1,3&#8208;Diisopropylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 3,4&#8208;Me2&#8208;Ph&#8208;form=N,N&#8242;&#8208;Di(3,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;phenyl)formamidine) (Au26) has been obtained by one pot synthesis, i.e. the direct reduction of Me2SAuCl in the presence of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and amidinate ligands. ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS reveals that the Me2S ligand is detached from the cluster to form open sites. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Surprisingly, Au26 has 15 valence electrons, and the presence of an unpaired electron is confirmed by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). This open&#8208;shelled Au26 not only shows unexpected high stability but also exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, achieving a remarkable turnover number up to 100670.

         <title>Isolated Neutral Organic Radical Unveiled Solvent&#8208;Radical Interaction in Highly Reducing Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated neutral helicene radical revealed the missing link in highly photoreducing consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) mechanism. Extensive mechanistic studies implied interaction of short&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive photoexcited radical and acetonitrile that generates reduced solvent. To that end, numerous extreme photoreduction have been showcased through useful functionalization of aryl halides using reduced solvent mediated conPET method.







Abstract
Diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics is a key mechanistic debate when consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) is discussed in photoredox catalysis. In&#8197;situ generated organic photoactive radicals can access catalytic systems as reducing as alkaline metals that can activate remarkably stable bonds. However, in many cases, the extremely short&#8208;lived transient nature of these doublet state open&#8208;shell species has led to debatable mechanistic studies, hindering adoption and development. Herein, we document the use of an isolated and stable neutral organic nPrDMQA radical as a highly photoreducing species. The isolated radical offers a unique platform to investigate the mechanism behind the photocatalytic activity of organic photocatalyst radicals. The involvement of reduced solvent is observed, formed by single electron transfer (SET) between the short&#8208;lived excited state nPrDMQA radical and the solvent. In our detailed mechanistic studies, spectroscopic and chemical affirmation of solvent reduction is strongly evident. Reduction of aryl halides, including difluoroarenes is presented as a model study of the conPET method. Further, the activation of N2O, a greenhouse gas that is yet to be activated by photoredox catalysis, is showcased in the absence of a transition metal.

         <title>Adamantane&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate Phosphors AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ via Medium&#8208;Pressure Ion&#8208;Exchange Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile method for the synthesis of nitridophosphate&#8208;based phosphors using hot isostatic pressing is presented. Ion exchange reactions starting from the Li&#8208;ion conductor Li10P4N10 enables the preparation of single crystals and bulk samples of compounds with the general formula AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10. Upon doping with Eu2+, these compounds exhibit remarkable luminescent properties across the green to red spectral range.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates have emerged as promising host compounds in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. Their industrial relevance has increased significantly, mainly due to recent advances in synthetic approaches under medium&#8208;pressure (MP) conditions, including ammonothermal synthesis and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary representatives CaxLi10&#8722;2xP4N10 (x=2, 2.7, 4) and Sr3Li4P4N10, prepared via a simplified ion exchange reaction under MP conditions, starting from the nitridophosphate&#8208;based lithium ion conductor Li10P4N10. The synthesis route allowed for the preservation of the anionic [P4N10]10&#8722; structural motif of the starting material, while simultaneously introducing potential doping sites for Eu2+ by incorporating divalent alkaline earth cations (Ca2+/Sr2+). Upon excitation of Eu2+ doped samples with blue light, strong luminescence due to parity&#8208;allowed 4f6(7F)5d1&#8594;4f7(8S7/2) transition can be observed in the red (Ca2Li6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=626&#8197;nm), yellow/orange (Ca2.7Li4.6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max1=506&#8197;nm, &#955;max2=592&#8197;nm and Sr3Li4P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=596&#8197;nm) and green (Ca4Li2P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=546&#8197;nm) spectral regions of the visible light. The compounds presented, together with the simplified synthetic approach, demonstrate the significant potential of ion exchange on Li ion conductors for the development of novel nitridophosphates in the future.

         <title>The Intrinsic Fluorescence of Peptide Self&#8208;Assemblies Across pH Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation deciphers the pivotal role of main&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding in peptide self&#8208;assembly as the primary source of intrinsic fluorescence. It demonstrates how pH&#8208;induced morphological diversity in peptides maintains fixed fluorescence peaks through the integrity of these bonding networks, while fluorescence intensity is modulated by structural variations. The study preliminarily unveils the fluorescence properties and regulatory mechanisms of self&#8208;assembled peptides.







Abstract
The regulation of solution pH on the structural and optical properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies remains a critical yet unresolved issue in peptide research. This study investigates the heptapeptide Ac&#8208;IHIHIQI&#8208;NH2 and its intrinsic fluorescence across a range of pH levels, demonstrating that variations in pH lead to significant changes in the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures. While the position of the fluorescence emission remains constant&#8212;due to the stability provided by the hydrogen bonding network of the peptide backbone&#8212;the intensity of the fluorescence exhibits a direct correlation with the degree of self&#8208;assembly. This finding underscores a dynamic relationship between structural morphology and optical properties. Notably, the ability of the peptide to self&#8208;assemble under diverse pH conditions is a novel observation that contrasts with previously reported literature. By employing a computationally driven approach, complemented by rigorous experimental validation, this work establishes a new paradigm for studying complex interacting systems such as peptide self&#8208;assembly. Our findings enhance the understanding of how environmental factors influence peptide behavior and pave the way for the design of innovative peptide&#8208;based materials with tunable optical characteristics, with potential applications in bioluminescent probes and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Coordinative Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;Electron Magnetic Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;coordinated polymers of &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins were fabricated by on&#8208;surface synthesis and coordination chemistry methods. Each porphyrinoid monomer features antiferromagnetic coupling and no interaction between nearest neighbors within the polymer backbone, behaving as a single magnetic entity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Electron magnetic compounds on surfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to interrogate spin interactions at the atomic scale, with great potential in spintronics and quantum technologies. A key challenge is organizing these compounds over large length scales, while elucidating their resulting magnetic properties. Herein, we offer a relevant contribution toward this objective, which consists of using on&#8208;surface synthesis coupled with coordination chemistry to promote the self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic porphyrin species. A porphyrin precursor equipped with carbonitrile moieties in a trans arrangement was prepared by solution synthesis and deposited on Au(111)/mica. Depending on the specific growth protocol, surface&#8208;promoted reactions led to the transformation of the precursor into non&#8208;magnetic Au&#8208;CN coordinated porphyrin monomers, covalent porphyrin dimers, and one&#8208;dimensional porphyrin polymers (based on porphyrin monomers or covalent porphyrin dimers), as revealed by scanning probe microscopy studies combined with theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the scanning tunneling microscopy tip could convert such closed&#8208;shell porphyrin units into open&#8208;shell species by the removal of some peripheral hydrogen atoms. The magnetic features (i.e., singlet or triplet ground state) of the porphyrin units comprising the polymers were investigated for polymers of different lengths. No magnetic exchange coupling between adjacent units was observed, suggesting protection of the magnetic entities.

         <title>Dendritic Molecular Baskets for Selective Binding of Toxic Methotrexate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic molecular baskets are biocompatible cavitands capable of including toxic methotrexate (MTX) in their aromatic cavity. The binding is chemoselective with the complex forming in competitive cell media. With the unique mode of recognition and modular structure, dendritic baskets are leading candidates for developing effective antidotes against MTX poisoning.







Abstract
We describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and bioactivity of dendritic basket 612&#8722;. This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (S)&#8208;glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self&#8208;association. 1H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between 612&#8722; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX2&#8722;) in water (Kd=9.2&#8197;&#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX2&#8722; folds inside 612&#8722; (&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N&#8208;methyl group. In consequence, 612&#8722; selectively binds MTX2&#8722; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC50&gt;150&#8197;&#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;6]14&#8722; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX2&#8722; as dihydrofolate reductase's affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of 612&#8722;. Nonetheless, considering the basket's biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.

This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self-association. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in water (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=9.2&#8197;&#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; folds inside &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N-methyl group. In consequence, &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectively binds MTX&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;150&#8197;&#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as dihydrofolate reductase's affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;12&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Nonetheless, considering the basket's biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Aromatic Linkers in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on the Performance of Monolithic Perovskite/Si Tandem Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PTZ&#8208;SAMs with various aromatic linkers and linking orientations were designed and synthesized as the hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). &#946;&#8208;NapPAPT could form dense and highly ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level alignment with the perovskite films.







Abstract
Aromatic linker&#8208;constructed self&#8208;assembled monolayers (Ar&#8208;SAMs) with enlarged dipole moment can modulate the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO), thereby improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. However, the specific role of the aromatic linkers between the polycyclic head and the anchoring groups of SAMs in determining the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we developed a series of phenothiazine&#8208;based Ar&#8208;SAMs to investigate how different aromatic linkers could affect molecular stacking, the regulation of substrate work function, and charge carrier dynamics. When served as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in PSCs and monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs), we found that the Ar&#8208;SAM with naphthalene linker along the 2,6&#8208;position axis (&#946;&#8208;Nap) could form dense and highly ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level alignment with the perovskite films. Using this strategy, the optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.86&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis, utilizing a 1.68&#8197;eV perovskite. Additionally, the encapsulated devices demonstrated enhanced stability under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2, 50&#8201;% RH, 65&#8201;&#176;C) with a T91 of 1000&#8197;hours. Notably, the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs, based on solution&#8208;processed micron&#8208;scale textured silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, achieved an efficiency of 28.89&#8201;% while maintaining outstanding reproducibility. This strategy holds significant promise for developing aromatic linking groups to enhance the hole selectivity of SAMs.

         <title>Locking up G&#8208;Quadruplexes with Light&#8208;Triggered Staples Leads to Increased Topological, Thermodynamic, and Metabolic Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

A photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) and intercalated motif (IM) structures enhances their stability, locks their topology, and increases enzymatic resistance while preserving biological activity. This method, applied to the Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) model and other G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, shows promise for future therapeutic applications, including more stable aptamers and molecular decoys in biological systems.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) are secondary, tetraplexed DNA structures abundant in non&#8208;coding regions of the genome, implicated in gene transcription processes and currently firmly recognised as important potential therapeutic targets. Given their affinity for human proteins, G4 structures are investigated as potential decoys and aptamers. However, G4&#8197;s tend to adopt different conformations depending on the exact environmental conditions, and often only one displays the specifically desired biological activity. Their less intensively studied counterparts, the elusive tetraplexed intercalated&#8208;motifs (IMs) are typically unstable at neutral pH, hampering the investigation of their potential involvement in a biological context. We herein report on a photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; such tetraplexed&#8208;structures, to increase their stability, lock their topology and enhance their enzymatic resistance, while maintaining biological activity. The chemical structure and topology of the stapled Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) was spectroscopically characterised and rationalised in silico. The method was then extended to other biologically relevant G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, hinting towards potential application of such stapled structures in a therapeutic context.

         <title>Buffered Hydroxyl Radical for Photocatalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative Methane Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven chemical cycle to generate &#8901;OH buffer, in which SO42&#8722; moderates &#8901;OH concentration by balancing &#8901;OH generation from excited&#8208;state [FeIII(SO4)(H2O)5]+ and the back reaction between &#8901;OH and Fe2+.







Abstract
Hydroxy radical (&#8901;OH) is a prestigious oxidant that allows the cleavage of strong chemical bonds of methane but is untamed, leading to over&#8208;oxidation of methane and waste of oxidants, especially at high methane conversion. Here, we managed to buffer &#8901;OH in an aqueous solution of photo&#8208;irradiated Fe3+, where &#8901;OH almost participates in methane oxidation. Due to the interaction between Fe3+ and SO42&#8722;, the electron transfer from OH&#8722; to excited&#8208;state Fe3+ for &#8901;OH generation is retarded, while excessive &#8901;OH is consumed by generated Fe2+ to restore Fe3+. When combined with a Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalyst, the buffered &#8901;OH converts methane to C2+ hydrocarbons and H2 with formation rates of 246 and 418&#8197;&#956;mol h&#8722;1, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches 13.0&#177;0.2&#8201;%, along with 10.2&#8201;% methane conversion and 81&#8201;% C2+ selectivity after 80&#8197;hours of reaction. Overall, this work presents a strategy for controlling active radicals for selective and efficient photocatalysis.

         <title>Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox Electrocatalyst for Durable Oxygen Evolution in Acid Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Cl&#8722;&#8208;assisted active site transfer strategy on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, achieving high OER selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic seawater. Typically, *Cl occupies the Ru site, shifting the OER center to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn, preventing metal site dissolution. Additionally, the active Mn sites create an environment that favors OER over CER, offering a selective and durable solution for acidic seawater electrolysis.







Abstract
Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir&#8208;based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non&#8208;precious Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200&#8197;hours. Different from the Cl&#8722;&#8208;free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER&#8208;insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER&#8208;favored local environment that inhibits CER.

&lt;p&gt;We report a Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-assisted active site transfer strategy on Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving high OER selectivity and long-term stability in acidic seawater. Typically, *Cl occupies the Ru site, shifting the OER center to CER-insensitive Mn, preventing metal site dissolution. Additionally, the active Mn sites create an environment that favors OER over CER, offering a selective and durable solution for acidic seawater electrolysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir-based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non-precious Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200&#8197;hours. Different from the Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER-insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER-favored local environment that inhibits CER. We introduce Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-assisted transfer of OER active sites to CER-insensitive Mn as a fundamental strategy for achieving highly selective and durable oxygen evolution in acidic seawater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25&#8201;%. These iCOFs are characterized by numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability, enabling efficient water vapor adsorption even at relatively low humidity levels. Through the use of various hygroscopic salt cations and precise control of ion concentration within the pores, the water state within the iCOFs pores can be effectively managed. Among the iCOFs, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li stands out with an impressive adsorption capacity of 0.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 from 0 to 22&#8201;% RH. Notably, due to its ionic porous structure, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li exhibits a significantly lower enthalpy of evaporation, measured at 967.04&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1, compared to bulk water with an enthalpy of 2387.40&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, under simulated conditions of 1.5 solar intensity at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the majority of the adsorbed water can be rapidly desorbed without the need for additional energy input. This efficient desorption process contributes to a high water collection rate of 0.092&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the final atmospheric water harvesting device. The development of these iCOFs offers a promising and cost&#8208;effective solution for obtaining fresh water in arid regions.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Olefins on Anorthic NaCoFe Alloy Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active (FexCoy)5C2 structure is developed through the synergistic effect of electronic (sodium) and structural (cobalt) promoters. This strategy facilitates the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into olefins at a low temperature of 240&#8201;&#176;C, achieving the highest STY of olefins at low temperatures, even better than a significant proportion under high&#8208;temperature operating conditions. Additionally, it retains the capability to synthesize olefins at 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins (CTO) represents an ideal pathway towards carbon neutrality. However, most current CTO catalysts require a high&#8208;temperature condition of 300&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C, resulting in high energy consumption and possible aggregation among active sites. Herein, we developed an efficient iron&#8208;based catalyst modified with high&#8208;sodium content (7&#8201;%) and low&#8208;cobalt content (2&#8201;%), achieving a CO2 conversion of 22.0&#8201;% and an olefin selectivity of 55.9&#8201;% at 240&#8201;&#176;C and 1000&#8197;mL/g/h, and it is even active at 180&#8201;&#176;C and 4000&#8197;mL/g/h with more than 25&#8201;% olefins in hydrocarbons. The catalyst was kept stable under continuous operating conditions of 500&#8197;hours. Numerous characterizations and calculations reveal high content of sodium as an electronic promoter enhances the stability of the active anorthic Fe5C2 phase at low temperatures. Further incorporating the above catalyst with cobalt, as a structural promoter, causes Fe species to form a FexCoy alloying phase, which in turn facilitates the formation of higher active anorthic (FexCoy)5C2 phase, different from the conventional carbides and alloy carbides. An in&#8208;depth investigation of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic promoters can improve catalyst performance, increase reaction efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and provide profound insights for understanding and optimizing CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Electron Transfer Mediator Modulates Type II Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Photosensitizers for Type I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal electron transfer&#8208;based strategy is introduced to modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This approach enables the conversion of existing Type&#8197;II MOFs into Type&#8197;I MOFs with hypoxic tolerance to function effectively under low&#8208;oxygen conditions, providing new insight into the development of Type&#8197;I MOFs.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive and effective local treatment, heavily depends on photosensitizer (PS) performance and oxygen availability. Despite the use of PS&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to address the solubility and aggregation issues of PSs, the inherent hypoxic intolerance of mainstream Type&#8197;II PDT remains challenging. Herein, we report an electron transfer strategy for the fabrication of hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type&#8197;I MOFs by encapsulating thymoquinone (TQ) into existing Type&#8197;II MOFs. With TQ serving as an effective electron transfer mediator, it facilitates the electron transfer process from the MOF ligand PS to oxygen, establishing the Type&#8197;I pathway and attenuating the original Type&#8197;II pathway. Four representative porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are synthesized to demonstrate the proposed strategy. Our findings reveal that TQ@MOF&#8208;1 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit enhanced anticancer activity under hypoxic conditions and superior in vivo antitumor efficacy compared to parent MOF&#8208;1 NPs. This work offers an effective and universal strategy to modulate ROS generation in PS&#8208;based MOFs, endowing hypoxic tolerance with improved PDT performance against solid tumors.

         <title>Tailoring the Reprocessability of Thiol&#8208;Ene Networks through Ring Size Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprocessing of thiol&#8208;ene networks was accomplished by carefully tuning the relative distance between two thioether functionalities and elevating the neighboring group participation concept. As a result we achieved a fast bond exchange at high temperatures. This allowed extrusion processing of cross&#8208;linked materials, while maintaining structural integrity below 70&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Recycling thermosetting materials presents itself as a major challenge in achieving sustainable material use. Dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking of polymers has emerged as a viable solution that can combine the structural integrity of thermosetting materials with the (re&#8722;)processability of thermoplastics. Thioether linkages between polymer chains are quite common, and their use dates back to the vulcanization of rubbers. While it is known that thioether bonds can be triggered to exchange through transalkylation reactions, this process is usually slow, as thioether moieties not only have to be activated by an alkylating agent, but the activated thioether also has to associate with a second thioether moiety in a classical SN2&#8208;type process. Here, we present the rational design of dynamic polymer networks based on simple dithiol&#8208;based monomers and a fatty acid derived triene. Two neighboring thioethers can undergo a much faster bond exchange reaction, and we found that the exchange dynamics can be further tuned over almost three orders of magnitude by tailoring the distance between two thioether functionalities. This resulted in thioether&#8208;cross&#8208;linked materials that could be processed by extrusion, a continuous reprocessing technique that was previously not accessible for this class of cross&#8208;linked materials, while still exhibiting appealing creep&#8208;resistance below 70&#8201;&#176;C.

     alt="Tailoring the Reprocessability of Thiol-Ene Networks through Ring Size Effects"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprocessing of thiol-ene networks was accomplished by carefully tuning the relative distance between two thioether functionalities and elevating the neighboring group participation concept. As a result we achieved a fast bond exchange at high temperatures. This allowed extrusion processing of cross-linked materials, while maintaining structural integrity below 70&#8201;&#176;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recycling thermosetting materials presents itself as a major challenge in achieving sustainable material use. Dynamic covalent cross-linking of polymers has emerged as a viable solution that can combine the structural integrity of thermosetting materials with the (re&#8722;)processability of thermoplastics. Thioether linkages between polymer chains are quite common, and their use dates back to the vulcanization of rubbers. While it is known that thioether bonds can be triggered to exchange through transalkylation reactions, this process is usually slow, as thioether moieties not only have to be activated by an alkylating agent, but the activated thioether also has to associate with a second thioether moiety in a classical S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-type process. Here, we present the rational design of dynamic polymer networks based on simple dithiol-based monomers and a fatty acid derived triene. Two neighboring thioethers can undergo a much faster bond exchange reaction, and we found that the exchange dynamics can be further tuned over almost three orders of magnitude by tailoring the distance between two thioether functionalities. This resulted in thioether-cross-linked materials that could be processed by extrusion, a continuous reprocessing technique that was previously not accessible for this class of cross-linked materials, while still exhibiting appealing creep-resistance below 70&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a perovskite quantum dot (QD)&#8208;dye system for efficient energy transfer (ET) from QDs to dyes occurring via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type interaction, at minimal donor&#8208;acceptor spectral overlap. Dyes containing a dimethyl iminium binding group as part of their conjugated system are chosen for high binding affinity to QD surface, crucial for donor&#8208;acceptor spatial wavefunction overlap for efficient ET.







Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes to CsPbBr3 surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications, such as lighting.

         <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products by Modulating the Surface Microenvironment of Electrode with Polyethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

PEG was incorporated into the Cu electrode, achieving an FEC2+ of 90.3&#8201;% at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This modification relaxes Nafion, increasing active site availability and enhancing *CO and *OH adsorption, promoting C&#8722;C coupling. Simultaneously, the restructured hydrogen bond network reduces active hydrogen species, suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Modulating the surface microenvironment of electrodes stands as a pivotal aspect in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, we propose an innovative approach by incorporating a small amount of linear oligomer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), into Cu2O catalysts during the preparation of the CuPEG electrode. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward multicarbon products (C2+) increases from 69.3&#8201;% over Cu electrode without PEG to 90.3&#8201;% over CuPEG electrode at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH in a flow cell. In situ investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that PEG molecules significantly modify the microenvironment on the Cu surface through hydrogen bond interactions. This modification leads to the relaxation of Nafion, increasing the availability of active sites and enhancing the adsorption of *CO and *OH, which in turn promotes C&#8722;C coupling. Concurrently, the reconstructed hydrogen bond network reduces the presence of active hydrogen species, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Strained Dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane Enabled Planar Chirality Construction and [2.2]Paracyclophane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical synthesis of strained dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane, a benzyne analogue of [2.2]paracyclophane was realized and it could be utilized in various strain&#8208;release nucleophilic or cycloaddition reactions to synthesize diverse functionalized [2.2]paracyclophanes. A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent alkynylation of this intermediate generated valuable planar chiral PCP building blocks and heterocycles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity. This method provides a new general platform for challenging planar chirality construction.







Abstract
Planar chirality found tremendous use in many fields, such as chemistry, optics, and materials science. In particular, planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) are a type of structurally interesting and practically useful chiral compounds bearing unique electronic and photophysical properties and thus have been widely used in &#960;&#8208;stacking polymers, organic luminescent materials, and as a valuable toolbox for developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts. However, the synthesis of chiral PCP derivatives remains a longstanding challenge. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on chiral preparative liquid chromatography separation or chemical and kinetic resolution reactions. Here, we report an enantioconvergent alkynylation of an in situ&#8208;formed dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane intermediate by asymmetric copper(I) catalysis. This approach enables the efficient synthesis of valuable planar chiral PCP building blocks and heterocycles with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. The success of this reaction lies in the development of a practical route to access strained dehydro&#8208;[2,2]&#8208;paracyclophane intermediates, which can also be utilized in various strain&#8208;release nucleophilic or cycloaddition reactions to synthesize diverse functionalized PCPs. DFT calculations of this reaction suggest that the enantioselectivity is determined by the aryne complexation with chiral copper(I) acetylide and the subsequent insertion reaction.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyzed Skeletal Rearrangement Enables the Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Xanthenes with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first example of a photocatalyzed intramolecular skeletal rearrangement strategy for constructing the xanthene scaffold. This approach has been successfully applied to synthesize highly functionalized xanthenes and to revise the structures of myrtucomvalones E and F. Furthermore, biological studies reveal that a xanthene demonstrates significant antiosteosarcoma activity both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Highly functionalized xanthenes possess an impressive range of bioactivities and daunting synthetic challenge due to their unique ring systems and stereocenters. Here, we report an unprecedented ketyl radicals&#8208;induced skeletal rearrangement reaction of spirodihydrobenzofurans, enabled by zero&#8208;valent iron as reducing agents via photoredox catalysis, facilitating the facile preparation of various highly functionalized xanthenes. The features of this protocol include high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, exceptionally mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, scalability to gram&#8208;scale quantities, and consistent delivery of good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies rationalize the function of this zero&#8208;valent iron&#8208;based reactivity in radical generation. Notably, this reaction was applied to the first asymmetric total synthesis of the complex polycyclic xanthene ent&#8208;myrtucomvalones E&#8722;F. Moreover, this work led to the discovery of an agent with highly effective antiosteosarcoma activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, potentially paving the way for the development of new xanthene&#8208;based candidates for osteosarcoma treatment.

         <title>The Role of Electron Transfer in Copper&#8208;Mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes were used to elucidate the mechanism of Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. For electron&#8208;rich substrates, a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism is followed, whereas electron&#8208;poor substrates follow CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr).







Abstract
We report copper(II) and copper(III) trifluoromethyl complexes supported by a pyridinedicarboxamide ligand (L) as a platform for investigating the role of electron transfer in C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. While the copper(II) trifluoromethyl complex is unreactive towards (hetero)arenes, the formal copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex performs C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide range of (hetero)arenes. Mechanistic studies using the copper(III) trifluoromethyl complex suggest that the mechanism of arene trifluoromethylation is substrate&#8208;dependent. When the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer is high, the reaction proceeds through a previously unidentified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, where an initial electron transfer occurs between the substrate and oxidant prior to CF3 group transfer. Otherwise, a CF3 radical release/electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism is followed. These studies provide valuable insights into the role of strong oxidants and potential mechanistic dichotomy in Cu&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.

         <title>Unlocking Mesoscopic Disorder in Graphitic Carbon with Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. Our combined experimental and theoretical work provides a roadmap for elucidating mesoscopic disorder in graphitic carbon electrode materials under potential bias.







Abstract
Intrinsic structural and oxidic defects activate graphitic carbon electrodes towards electrochemical reactions underpinning energy conversion and storage technologies. Yet, these defects can also disrupt the long&#8208;range and periodic arrangement of carbon atoms, thus, the characterization of graphitic carbon electrodes necessitates in&#8208;situ atomistic differentiation of graphitic regions from mesoscopic bulk disorder. Here, we leverage the combined techniques of in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations to reveal that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. With this platform, we identify graphitic regions from amorphous domains by discovering that they demonstrate opposing electric&#8208;field&#8208;dependent infrared activity under electrochemical conditions. Our work provides a roadmap for identifying mesoscopic disorder in bulk carbon materials under potential bias.

         <title>Achieving over 20&#8201;% Efficiency in Laminated HTM&#8208;Free Carbon Electrode Perovskite Solar Cells through In Situ Interface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a chemical&#8208;mechanical in situ interface reconstruction strategy for the fabrication of HTM&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c&#8208;PSCs) by laminating a free&#8208;standing carbon electrode onto perovskite film. Our new strategy overcomes the contact issues within the perovskite/carbon electrode interface and boosts the efficiency to 20.31&#8201;% with enhanced stability.







Abstract
Laminating a free&#8208;standing carbon electrode film onto perovskite film is a promising method for fabricating HTM (hole transport material)&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells (c&#8208;PSCs), offering more flexibility by decoupling the processes of carbon electrode and perovskite layer formation. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of laminated HTM&#8208;free c&#8208;PSCs (&lt;16.5&#8201;%) remains lower compared to c&#8208;PSCs with printed carbon pastes (&gt;20&#8201;%), primarily due to poor interfacial contact between the perovskite and carbon layers. Herein, we report a chemical&#8208;mechanical driven in situ interface reconstruction strategy to solve such interface contact issues. The in situ interface reconstruction is firstly triggered by methylammonium chloride (MACl) surface treatment to chemically activate the film and then mechanically laminate the carbon electrode onto the softened perovskite film under heating. The perovskite film undergoes in situ regrowth and the carbon film starts to cure simultaneously, dynamically reconstructing the perovskite/carbon electrode interface. A tighter and conformal contact is achieved, greatly facilitating the carrier transport and extract. Ultimately, a champion PCE of 20.31&#8201;% is achieved with enhanced stability. Our in situ interface reconstruction strategy which is combinating the chemical and mechanical process offers a new choice for the further design of low&#8208;cost and efficient HTM&#8208;free c&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polyesters and Polycarbonates by Magnesium&#8208;Based Lewis Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MgCl2 catalyst system exhibits high selectivity and compatibility towards the depolymerization of the aliphatic (co)polyesters and polycarbonates under mild, solvent&#8208;free conditions (up to 98&#8201;% monomer yields). This approach provides a promising solution to the circular utilization of plastic materials.







Abstract
Developing a simple and efficient catalyst system for closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers to monomers is an essentially important but challenging task for the recycle of polymer wastes and preventing the downcycle of plastic products. Herein, we employ inexpensive, commercially available Lewis acids (LAs) to achieve closed&#8208;loop recycling in bulk through the catalytic depolymerization of aliphatic polyesters and polycarbonates. The scope of LAs is screened by thermogravimetric analysis experiments and distillation experiments. MgCl2 shows the best catalytic performance that can efficiently depolymerize eleven aliphatic polyesters and polycarbonates (i.e. poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) and poly(trimethylene carbonate)), into monomers (up to 98&#8201;% yield) at temperatures significantly lower than the ceiling temperature. Moreover, this catalyst system exhibits high selectivity and compatibility towards the depolymerization of (co)polyesters as well as the blends of polyesters and polycarbonates in the presence of other commodity plastics, as well as excellent recycle and reuse catalyst performance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the closed&#8208;loop recycling of monomers is achieved through the random chain scission and terminal group cyclization.

         <title>Regulating Crystalline Phase/Plane of Polymer Electrolyte for Rapid Lithium Ion Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insight into the mechanism of crystal phase and plane exerts on the transfer of lithium ion in poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) based polymer electrolytes is investigated in depth. &#946;&#8208;phase&#8208;dominant segments are obtained by regulating dissolving process and the newly exposed (111/201)&#946; crystal planes are conducive to provide more ion transport channels, which is beneficial to the rapid and smooth transfer of lithium ion.







Abstract
Electronic&#8208;rich functional groups and flexible segments have long been perceived to be the decisive factors influencing lithium&#8208;ion transfer in polymer electrolytes, while crystallinity is regarded as the great scourge. Actually, the research on the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane is still in scarcity.

&lt;p&gt;A new insight into the mechanism of crystal phase and plane exerts on the transfer of lithium ion in poly(vinylidene fluoride)-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) based polymer electrolytes is investigated in depth. &#946;-phase-dominant segments are obtained by regulating dissolving process and the newly exposed (111/201)&#946; crystal planes are conducive to provide more ion transport channels, which is beneficial to the rapid and smooth transfer of lithium ion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic-rich functional groups and flexible segments have long been perceived to be the decisive factors influencing lithium-ion transfer in polymer electrolytes, while crystallinity is regarded as the great scourge. Actually, the research on the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane is still in scarcity. Herein, taking poly(vinylidene fluoride)-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) as an example, new (111/201) crystal planes (belonged to &#946;-phase) are regulated by dissolving process and clarified by Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and X-ray diffraction. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the newly exposed (111/201) crystal planes provide higher binding energy with lithium ions and are conducive to provide more ion transport channels. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li nuclear magnetic resonance of new crystalline planes contained PVDF-HFP based electrolyte shows lower field and sharper peak intensity, further proves the rapid lithium ion transfer. Therefore, a high ionic conductivity of 6.42&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a large lithium-ion transfer number of 0.7 are achieved.

         <title>Evolution of Supramolecular Coordination Assemblies Visually Monitored by Time&#8208;Dependent Multicolor Fluorescence</title>

The metastable nanofiber structures triggered by the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and coordination between zinc ions and the organic ligands evolved into nanosheet assemblies over time in water, accompanied by fluorescence changes that enabled visual monitoring. This strategy could be extended to multiple ions and offers applications in temporal dynamic fluorescence encryption.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination assemblies play an important role in both material science and biological systems. Despite significant efforts in their development, most existing examples are thermodynamically controlled, which lack the adaptability and autonomy essential for the creation of advanced materials. In this work, we have developed non&#8208;equilibrium coordination assembly systems that can evolve over time through a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic controls. The introduction of zinc ions resulted in the formation of metastable fiber assemblies in a kinetically trapped state, which autonomously converted to thermodynamically stable nanosheets over time. This evolution process can be regulated by external stimuli and visually monitored by the time&#8208;dependent multicolor fluorescence. The construction strategy was versatile across other various ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, offering inspiring insights for the design of complex systems that operated both in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Enhanced Photoiniferter Polymerization under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter polymerization operating efficiently under visible light is reported. Addition of biocompatible citric acid, accelerates photolysis, eliminating induction periods by enhancing chain transfer agent consumption and reaction rates. This method yields well&#8208;defined polymers with near&#8208;quantitative conversions in just two hours and demonstrates versatility across various monomers, including the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers.







Abstract
Photoiniferter (PI) is a promising polymerization methodology, often used to overcome restrictions posed by thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization. However, in the overwhelming majority of reports, high energy UV irradiation is required to effectively trigger photolysis of RAFT agents and facilitate the polymerization, significantly limiting its potential, scope, and applicability. Although visible light PI has emerged as a highly attractive alternative, most current approaches are limited to the synthesis of lower molecular weight polymers (i.e. 10,000&#8197;g/mol), and typically suffer from prolonged reaction times, extended induction periods, and higher dispersities when high activity CTAs (photoiniferters), such as trithiocarbonates, are employed. Herein, an acid&#8208;enhanced PI polymerization is introduced that efficiently operates under visible light irradiation. The presence of small amounts of biocompatible citric acid fully eliminates the lengthy induction period (21&#8197;hours) by enhancing photolysis, rapidly consuming the CTA, and accelerating the reaction rate, yielding polymers with narrow molar mass distributions (&#208; ~1.1), near&#8208;quantitative conversions (&gt;97&#8201;%), and high end&#8208;group fidelity in just two hours. A particularly noteworthy aspect of this work is the possibility to target very high degrees of polymerization (i.e. DP=3,000) within short timescales (i.e. less than five hours) without compromising the control over the dispersity (&#208; ~1.1). The versatility of the technique is further demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined diblock copolymers and its compatibility to various polymer classes (i.e. acrylamides, acrylates, methacrylates), thus establishing visible&#8208;light PI as a robust tool for polymer synthesis.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Interpenetration&#8208;Free Mesoporous Aromatic Frameworks by Manipulating Catalysts as Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning the size of the catalyst ligand, a mesoporous aromatic framework, PAF&#8208;333, was obtained. It was found that the steric hindrance of larger&#8208;sized ligands avoided the framework interpenetration. Thanks to its large pore volume (3.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), it could adsorb 13.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% of hydrogen at 77&#8197;K, 100&#8197;bar and 0.537&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 of methane at 298&#8197;K, 98&#8197;bar, making it an ideal candidate for large&#8208;scale on&#8208;board methane storage.







Abstract
Reticular chemistry allows the design and synthesis of mesoporous networks by extending the size of the building blocks. However, interpenetration of the nets easily happens against the designed mesoporous networks, thereby falling short of achieving the intended specific surface area and pore size. Controlling the framework interpenetration has always been a challenge in the synthesis section of reticular chemistry. In this work, based on our previously reported type of highly porous aromatic frameworks (named PAF&#8208;1), we extended the tetrahedral building blocks to target an iso&#8208;reticular mesoporous PAF&#8208;333. A series of Ni(0) ligands with different sizes were employed to confirm that suitable&#8208;sized catalyst ligands could successfully inhibit skeleton interpenetration in the coupling reaction through the steric hindrance effect. The obtained mesoporous PAF&#8208;333 possessed a pore size of approximately 3.2&#8197;nm matching well with the value from the predicted non&#8208;interpenetrated structure. PAF&#8208;333 showed great high&#8208;pressure hydrogen and methane storage potential with a 13.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 uptake at 77&#8197;K, 100&#8197;bar and a 0.537&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 CH4 uptake at 298&#8197;K, 98&#8197;bar, ranking at the top of the reported porous adsorbents in the gas storage applications.

         <title>Manipulating Interphase Chemistry for Aqueous Zn Stabilization: The Role of Supersaturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn4SO4(OH)6&#8901;xH2O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation&#8208;controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. Attributed to the supersaturated environment created by caprolactam, ZSH selectively exposes high&#8208;energy (001) plane and initiates a pseudo&#8208;coincidence interface that significantly boosts the Zn lifespan.







Abstract
The limited cycling durability of Zn anode, attributed to the absence of a robust electrolyte&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), remains the bottleneck for the practical deployment of aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn4SO4(OH)6&#8901;xH2O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation&#8208;controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. By judiciously creating local high&#8208;supersaturation environment with organic caprolactam to manipulate the precipitation manner of zinc sulfate hydroxide (ZSH), lattice&#8208;lattice matched heterogeneous nucleation of ZSH (001) and Zn (002) is realized in aqueous ZnSO4, producing a dense, pseudo&#8208;coincidence interface capable of functioning as decent SEI. The plating/stripping efficacy of Zn is significantly boosted, as reflected by the great improvement of the initial (from 59.9&#8201;% to 84.1&#8201;%) and average (from 94.0&#8201;% to 99.2&#8201;%) coulombic efficiency. Accordingly, the cyclic endurance of Zn anode is prolonged from 50&#8197;h to over 7000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, witnessing 140&#8208;fold lifespan extension. Profiting from supersaturation&#8208;mediated Zn stabilization, the performance deterioration of zinc&#8208;vanadium batteries is also alleviated, even with a low N/P ratio of 4.4. This work is anticipated to deepen current understanding on the control of the anodic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;We highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;xH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation-controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. Attributed to the supersaturated environment created by caprolactam, ZSH selectively exposes high-energy (001) plane and initiates a pseudo-coincidence interface that significantly boosts the Zn lifespan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited cycling durability of Zn anode, attributed to the absence of a robust electrolyte-derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), remains the bottleneck for the practical deployment of aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we highlight the role of local supersaturation in governing the fundamental crystallization chemistry of Zn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;xH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ZSH) and propose a subtle supersaturation-controlled morphology strategy to tailor the interphase chemistry of Zn anode. By judiciously creating local high-supersaturation environment with organic caprolactam to manipulate the precipitation manner of zinc sulfate hydroxide (ZSH), lattice-lattice matched heterogeneous nucleation of ZSH (001) and Zn (002) is realized in aqueous ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, producing a dense, pseudo-coincidence interface capable of functioning as decent SEI. The plating/stripping efficacy of Zn is significantly boosted, as reflected by the great improvement of the initial (from 59.9&#8201;% to 84.1&#8201;%) and average (from 94.0&#8201;% to 99.2&#8201;%) coulombic efficiency. Accordingly, the cyclic endurance of Zn anode is prolonged from 50&#8197;h to over 7000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, witnessing 140-fold lifespan extension. Profiting from supersaturation-mediated Zn stabilization, the performance deterioration of zinc-vanadium batteries is also alleviated, even with a low N/P ratio of 4.4. This work is anticipated to deepen current understanding on the control of the anodic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for embedding catalytically active polyoxovanadate (POV) into supramolecular assemblies was developed by utilizing host&#8208;guest interactions between pillararenes grafted on the cluster and ditopic linkers. The amphiphilic nature of the POV in the host&#8208;guest complex promoted responsive behavior of the assembly toward the solvent polarity. Lastly, the assembly showed enhanced catalytic properties compared to the parent POV.







Abstract
Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material for a given task. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as particularly interesting candidates to be used in supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in the fields of energy conversion/storage or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in the field of supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a POMcovalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene. By introducing a ditopic guest molecule that could interlink pillar[5]arene moieties, host&#8211;guest interactions were leveraged as the driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies incorporating hexavanadate clusters in a controlled manner. The enhanced catalytic performance of the resulting aggregates confirmed their potential application as functional catalytic materials. This novel approach for developing hexavanadate&#8208;based catalysts reported here showcases the potential of using host&#8211;guest interactions as a means to introduce catalytically active metal&#8208;oxo clusters into supramolecular frameworks.

         <title>Photomodulated Transient Catalytic Constitutional Dynamic Networks and Reaction Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation of dynamic DNA circuits/networks is demonstrated by photoprotection of an auxiliary caged unit yielding an oligonucleotide intervening with the temporally operating circuits. This is exemplified with photomodulation of DNAzyme or of dynamically operating DNA networks. The concept is applied to photomodulated network&#8208;guided inhibition of fibrinogenesis and controlling biocatalytic cascades.







Abstract
A method to photomodulate dynamically transient DNA&#8208;based reaction circuits and networks is introduced. The method relies on the integration of photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;phosphate ester&#8208;caged DNA hairpin with a &#8220;mute&#8221; reaction module. Photodeprotection (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) of the hairpin structure separates a fuel strand triggering the dynamic, transient, operation of the DNA circuit/network. By temporal photocleavage of the hairpin within the course of transient operation of the circuit, photomodulation of the systems are demonstrated. The modulation amplitude and rhythms are controlled by the time&#8208;interval and cycle numbers of photo&#8208;deprotecting the hairpin structure. The method is applied to transiently photomodulate the catalytic activities of a DNAzyme, enabling the photomodulation of the transient assembly of a constitutional dynamic network (CDN) and the transient reconfiguration of the CDN framework. The different systems are supported by computational kinetic models allowing to predict, and experimentally validate, the behavior of the systems under variable auxiliary conditions. Moreover, the photomodulated transient CDNs are implemented as functional frameworks guiding the thrombin&#8208;catalyzed coagulation of fibrinogen to fibrin (fibrinogenesis) and photomodulated operation of a biocatalytic cascade.

         <title>A FRET Autophagy Imaging Platform by Macrocyclic Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the robust assembly and broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of macrocyclic amphiphiles, we developed a FRET&#8208;based autophagy imaging platform that demonstrates versatility and convenience as a powerful tool for imaging organelle autophagy.







Abstract
Autophagy is a ubiquitous process of organelle interaction in eukaryotic cells, in which various organelles or proteins are recycled and operated through the autophagy pathway to ensure nutrient and energy homeostasis. Although numerous fluorescent probes have been developed to image autophagy, these environment&#8208;responsive probes suffer from inherent deficiencies such as inaccuracy and limited versatility. Here, we present a modular macrocyclic amphiphile F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) platform (SC6A12C/NCM, SN), constructed through the amphiphilic assembly of sulfonatocalix[6]arene (SC6A12C) with N&#8208;cetylmorpholine (NCM) for lysosome targeting. The hydrophobic fluorophore BPEA (FRET donor) was entrapped within the inner hydrophobic phase and showed strong fluorescence emission. Attributed to the broad&#8208;spectrum encapsulation of SC6A12C, three commercially available organelle probes (Mito&#8208;Tracker Red, ER Tracker Red, and RhoNox&#8208;1) were selected as SC6A12C guests (FRET acceptors). During autophagy process, the formation of intracellular host&#8211;guest complexes leads to strong FRET signal, allowing us to visualize the fusion of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus with lysosomes, respectively. This study provides a versatile and accessible platform for imaging organelle autophagy.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructed Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Enabling Subzero Capacity Unlocking of Cost&#8208;Effective and Long&#8208;Life Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8197;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst is shown to enhance redox kinetics of V2+/V3+ and selectively inhibit hydrogen evolution side reaction, achieving stable operation over 1200&#8197;cycles and enabling subzero capacity unlocking for cost&#8208;effective vanadium flow batteries.







Abstract
Vanadium flow battery (VFB) promises a route for achieving grid&#8208;scale power storage by harnessing renewable energy sources. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples and serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still restrict the further development of VFB. Addressing these challenges requires not only effective solutions but also ones that are cost&#8208;efficient and scalable to meet the demands of affordable energy storage. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst by incorporating metal ions into the electrolyte. The Cu core, encapsulated by the Cu6Sn5 shell, forms an excellent conductive pathway to the graphite felt electrode. Charge transfer between Cu and Sn within Cu6Sn5 shell accelerates the reaction kinetics of V2+/V3+ redox couple and selectively inhibits HER, as confirmed through in&#8197;situ weak measurement imaging method. The Cu@Cu6Sn5 battery achieves a peak power density of 1119.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operates stably for 1200&#8197;cycles without catalyst failure, and is available over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Furthermore, we identify a demand of subzero capacity unlocking. Achieving a 23.4&#8201;% theoretical capacity unlocking at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 1.75&#8197;V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost&#8208;effective VFB.

The Cu@Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; battery achieves a peak power density of 1119.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, operates stably for 1200&#8197;cycles without catalyst failure, and is available over a wide-temperature range. Furthermore, we identify a demand of subzero capacity unlocking. Achieving a 23.4&#8201;% theoretical capacity unlocking at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C with a cut-off voltage up to 1.75&#8197;V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost-effective VFB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 17.73&#8201;% Solar&#8208;To&#8208;Hydrogen Efficiency with Durably Active Catalyst in Stable Photovoltaic&#8208;Electrolysis Seawater System</title>

This study provides a forward&#8208;looking direction for the economically scalable production of green hydrogen and showcases an innovative insight for the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of interfacial&#8208;water dissociation&#8208;oxidation. The photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis system efficiently converts renewable energy sources into hydrogen, the integration of durable RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalyst promises industrial application viability. And the newly defined PVTH parameter sets a new benchmark for photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis systems.







Abstract
Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr&#8208;layered double hydroxide (RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units, in which low&#8208;loading Ru (0.32&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Rulds) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&#8722; repulsion by intercalated CO32&#8722; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units. The RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH&#8214;RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Employing RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73&#8201;% STH efficiency, corresponding photovoltaic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37&#8201;%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation&#8208;oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.

         <title>Adjacent&#8208;Ligand Tuning of Atomically Precise Cu&#8722;Pd Sites Enables Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation with a CO&#8208;Free Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing axial organic ligands to modify the atomically dispersed copper single atoms on the surface of Pd&#8208;metallene, we have constructed a catalyst with adjacent&#8208;ligand regulation effect to significantly enhance the catalytic performance of MOR.







Abstract
Whether the catalyst can realize the non&#8208;CO pathway is the key to greatly improve the catalytic activity and stability of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). It is feasible to optimize the reaction path selectivity by modifying organic ligands and constructing single&#8208;atom systems. At the same time, heterogeneous metal nanosheets with atomic thickness have been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of materials due to their ultra&#8208;high exposure of active sites and synergistic effects. Herein, we synthesize an ultra&#8208;thin heterogeneous alloy metallene with organic ligand&#8208;modified surface Cu single atom by one&#8208;pot wet chemical method, and further construct an efficient Cu&#8722;Pd active sites. The prepared octanoic acid ligand modified PdCu single&#8208;atom alloys metallene (SAA OA&#8722;Cu&#8208;Pdene) shows excellent catalytic activity and stability, with mass activity up to 5.64&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) up to 160.39&#8197;m2&#8201;gPd&#8722;1. Structural characterization and in situ experiment jointly indicate that ligand modulation brings about charge transfer, and the accompanying rapid migration of OH&#8722; greatly improves the selectivity of non&#8208;CO pathways while improving the catalytic activity. The results highlight the importance of adjacent&#8208;ligand regulation and provide a new strategy for the design of MOR catalysts with high selectivity of non&#8208;CO pathway.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Arene&#8208;Fused [n.1.1]&#8208;Bridged Molecules via Catalytic Cycloaddition and Rearrangement Reactions</title>

Boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of o&#8208;QMs or p&#8208;QMs with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in combination with selective Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements provides a collective approach for 6&#8197;types of medicinally attractive 2D/3D polycyclic compounds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] bridged scaffolds.







Abstract
Although great advancement has been made in synthesis of 3D bridged bicyclic[n.1.1]&#8208;bioisosteres, facile construction of 2D/3D merged molecules incorporating bridged rings, as novel chemical space in drug discovery, remains a significant challenge. Herein a collective, selective, and diversity&#8208;oriented approach for up to 6 types of 2D/3D polycyclic scaffolds featuring bicyclo[n.1.1] substructure is reported. A boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed [2&#963;+2&#960;] cycloaddition between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and ortho&#8208;quinone methides afforded spirocyclic compounds containing a bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes unit, which were used as intermediates for synthesis of three types of 2D/3D scaffolds via judiciously controlled Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements. The reaction and rearrangement of para&#8208;quinone methides worked analogously and provided another two polycyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Chloride Residues in RuO2 Catalysts Enhance Its Stability and Efficiency for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 catalysts and pure RuO2 catalysts with comparable morphology and crystallinity were synthesized to clarify the effects of chlorine residues on the performance of RuO2. Notably, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability in acidic OER by lowering the limiting potential and suppressing the LOM pathway, maintaining high performance for over 1200&#8197;hours at high current densities.







Abstract
. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 (RuO2&#8208;Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2&#8208;Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum&#8208;coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.

RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a lower overpotential of 176&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum-coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alloying Strategy Regulating Size and Electronic Structure of Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to Achieve High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by binary descriptors, 16 transition metal selenides are screened, and an alloying strategy is subsequently employed to controllably synthesize Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2/NG. This approach significantly reduces the surface energy while precisely tuning the band alignment and lattice matching between polysulfides and Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2/NG, thereby enhancing interfacial reaction kinetics and enabling the successful construction of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8722;&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of catalysts in lithium&#8722;&#8208;sulfur batteries has proven to be an efficacious avenue for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion. Specially, the size and electronic structure of catalysts play a pivotal role in harnessing the active sites and intrinsic catalysis activity. Outstanding MoSe2 and NbSe2 are were selected from 16 universal transition metal selenides based on the proposed binary descriptor. Then, an alloying strategy is was devised to prepare Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 flakelets for further improvement of the intrinsic catalysis. The integration of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that alloying Mo with Nb can regulate the surface energy and indexes of band match and lattice mismatch, thereby enabling Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to possess a small size, suitable adsorption energy and low reaction energy barrier. This optimization enhances the catalysis of sulfur reduction/evolution reaction and the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium. Consequently, an assembled Ah&#8208;level pouch cell is realized with dramatic cycle stability. With the electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.36&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8201;S&#8722;1, the cell can deliver a high energy density of up to 505.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1. This work pioneers a universal strategy for sculpting the geometric configurations and electronic structures of catalysts, to achieve enhanced catalytic activity and precise interpretation of structure&#8211;activity relationships.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 Electrocatalyst for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process results in the low conversion efficiency of NO3RR. Selenium&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 heterojunction is synthesized. The Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2 contributes to nitrate&#8208;deoxidation and hydrogenation, and Fe3O4 promotes water decomposition to provide H protons, which jointly promotes NO3RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8722; is a green and sustainable method that not only helps to treat industrial pollutants in wastewater, but also produces valuable chemicals. However, the slow dynamics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process results in a high barrier and low conversion efficiency. In this work, the Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 heterojunction was synthesized, which showed excellent electrochemical performance in 0.1&#8197;M nitrate reduction reaction, superior to most currently reported catalysts. The high activity of Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4 is due to the synergistic effect between FeSe2 and Fe3O4 to achieve relay catalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. Among them, the Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2 contributes to NO3&#8722; deoxygenation and subsequent hydrogenation, and Fe3O4 promotes H2O decomposition to provide H proton, jointly promote NO3RR. Finally, the online differential electrochemical mass spectra (DEMS), in&#8197;situ Raman and DFT calculation confirmed the optimal pathway for NO3RR to NH3 on Se&#8208;deficient FeSe2/Fe3O4(100). This strategy of relay catalysis provides a potential way to treat wastewater with high concentration nitrate.

The optimization of one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence through linker installation in an interpenetrated TPE&#8208;MOF. Both the crystal packing density and ligand conformations can be modulated by linker installation.







Abstract
Immobilizing organic chromophores within the rigid framework of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) augments fluorescence by effectively curtailing molecular motions. Yet, the substantial interspaces and free volumes inherent to MOFs can undermine photoluminescence efficiency, as they partially constrain intramolecular dynamics. In this study, we achieved optimization of both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence by incorporating linkers into an interpenetrated tetraphenylethene&#8208;based MOF (TPE&#8208;MOF). This linker installation strategy enables fine&#8208;tuning of both crystal packing density and ligand conformations. Strikingly, the desolvated MOFs exhibit remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections, reaching an impressive 8801&#8197;GM. Consequently, these materials demonstrate exceptional performance in one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited cellular imaging of HepG2 cells. Our work introduces an innovative approach to enhancing two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and broadens the scope of research into one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (1/2 PEF).

         <title>Decoupling H2 and O2 Release in Particulate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Using a Reversible O2 Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt) consisting of photoresponsive chip (HPCN), H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 ([Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+) is constructed to achieve the decoupling of particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes oxidize [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ into [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ and H+, while the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt through rGO for reduction of H+ to H2. Under visible irradiation, [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ is photolyzed back to [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ along with O2 evolution.







Abstract
H2 and O2 evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three&#8208;component photocatalyst, Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.

&lt;p&gt;Co(5&#8201;%)-HPCN/(rGO/Pt) consisting of photoresponsive chip (HPCN), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([Co(II)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is constructed to achieve the decoupling of particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes oxidize [Co(II)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into [Co(III)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, while the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt through rGO for reduction of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Under visible irradiation, [Co(III)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is photolyzed back to [Co(II)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; along with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost-effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three-component photocatalyst, Co(5&#8201;%)-HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Enantioselective Hydropyridylation of Dienes for the Synthesis of Chiral Diaryl Compounds via Concerted Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and 1,4&#8208;selective hydropyridylation has been developed. Using 2&#8208;fluoropyridine as the electrophile and a copper catalyst in conjunction with (R)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP, the desired chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl product was synthesized via a concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism.







Abstract
The synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds, particularly those containing a pyridine moiety, is of significant interest due to their pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hydropyridylation of conjugated dienes. Utilizing 2&#8208;fluoropyridine as the electrophile, CuOAc, and the chiral ligand Tol&#8208;BINAP, we optimized reaction conditions to achieve the desired chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl products containing both a pyridine and a cis&#8208;crotyl group. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the 1,2&#8208;hydrocupration step is enantio&#8208;determining, and the concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution proceeds via six&#8208;membered cyclic transition states.

         <title>Active Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Preferential Cleavage of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bonds in Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes decorated with Ni&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atoms is constructed for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The active *OH makes the GOR follow a direct oxidation pathway occurring at lower potentials. The optimized electronic state of Co single&#8208;atom regulated by Ni single&#8208;atom and Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy promotes *OH&#8208;mediated preferential cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds, leading to a high formate yield.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) to produce high&#8208;value formic acid (FA) is hindered by high formation potential of active species and sluggish C&#8722;C bond cleavage kinetics. Herein, Ni single&#8208;atom (NiSA) and Co single&#8208;atom (CoSA) dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy (Ni0.1Co0.9@NiSACoSA&#8208;NCNTs) are constructed for electrochemical GOR. Remarkably, it can reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of 1.15&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and realize a high formate selectivity of 93.27&#8201;% even at high glycerol conversion of 98.81&#8201;% at 1.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The GOR mechanism and pathway are systematically elucidated via experimental analyses and theoretical calculations. It is revealed that the active hydroxyl (*OH) can be produced during the GOR. The NiSA, CoSA, and Ni0.1Co0.9 synergistically optimizes the electronic structure of CoSA active sites, reducing the energy barriers of *OH&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds and dehydrogenation of C1 intermediates. This decreases the number of reaction intermediates and reaction steps of GOR&#8208;to&#8208;FA, thus increasing the formate production efficiency. After coupling GOR with hydrogen evolution reaction in a membrane electrode assembly cell, 14.26&#8197;g of formate and 23.10&#8197;L of H2 are produced at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 108&#8197;h.

         <title>Charge Manipulation of Porous Coordination Cages Tunes the Efficiency and Selectivity in Electrochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

The charge species of the porous coordination cages are regulated by ligand strategy. The charge&#8208;tunable porous coordination cages exhibit performance tweaking ability in the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, which can not only indirectly adjust the efficiency of nitrate electrosynthesis of ammonia, but also modulate the product selectivity of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals has been attracting growing interest owing to its environmentally benign reaction pathways. Among these processes, the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3), known as NO3RR, and the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) stand out as two cornerstone reactions; yet, their efficiency and selectivity pose ongoing challenges. In this study, we introduce a charge manipulation approach for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts tailored for the simultaneous coupling of NO3RR and HMFOR. We have synthesized a range of porous coordination cages (PCCs) that share the same topology and Co/Ni metal centers but incorporate different charged moieties, imparting them with distinct surface net charges. Electrocatalytic evaluations revealed that PCC&#8208;Co demonstrated a voltage&#8208;dependent activity in NO3RR. Conversely, PCC&#8208;Ni exhibited a precisely adjustable product selectivity in HMFOR, contingent upon the cage&#8216;s charge state. In situ analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations underscored the profound impact of catalyst charge on the differential adsorption of reaction intermediates and the lowest free energy change (&#916;G) during the pivotal reaction step, resulting in alterations to both activity and selectivity. These discoveries provide invaluable insights into the &#8220;structure&#8208;performance relationship&#8221; of NO3RR/HMFOR catalysts, highlighting PCCs as promising contenders for advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Lithiophilic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymer Modified Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was obtained and modified onto polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the lithiophilic triazine units, this ArMT@PP simplifies the solvation structure of Li+, facilitates the migration of Li+ and forms a stable solid electrolyte interface. The assembled LMBs achieved a capacity retention of 90.58&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
As traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries near their theoretical limits, the advancement of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) becomes crucial for achieving higher energy densities.

&lt;p&gt;A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was obtained and modified onto polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Due to the lithiophilic triazine units, this ArMT@PP simplifies the solvation structure of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, facilitates the migration of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and forms a stable solid electrolyte interface. The assembled LMBs achieved a capacity retention of 90.58&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As traditional lithium-ion batteries near their theoretical limits, the advancement of lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) becomes crucial for achieving higher energy densities. However, uncontrolled ion transport and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer are key factors inducing lithium dendrite growth, hindering the development of LMBs. Separator modification is an effective strategy to address the challenges of LMBs. To tackle the issues, a donor&#8211;acceptor polymer (ArMT) consisting of benzene rings and triazine was successfully synthesized and modified onto commercial polypropylene (ArMT@PP) as separators for LMBs. Benefitting from the highly lithiophilic triazine organic units, this ArMT exhibits affinity towards Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and simplifies the solvation structure of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during the diffusion process, thus decreasing the ion diffusion activation energy, thereby accelerating the migration of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, triazine organic units with appropriate pore size regulate the plating/stripping behavior of lithium metal anodes, thereby facilitating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. As a result, the assembled Li|ArMT@PP|Li symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping over 800&#8197;h.

This design strategy ensures a durable and dendrite-free anode and paves the way for the development of high-energy-density LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Antiaromatic Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage oxidation of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene regioisomers to their corresponding sulfones affords rationally designed molecules with varying degrees of donor/acceptor characteristics and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Depending on the fusion orientation of the donors and acceptors, the two most antiaromatic, oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30&#8211;40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of four donor/acceptor&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacenes via the late&#8208;stage oxidation of a family of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene&#8208;s&#8208;indacene regioisomers. A thorough study of their properties through experimental and computational analysis has revealed the effect of asymmetry on the molecular properties associated with antiaromaticity, as well as a strong correlation between antiaromaticity and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The strength of the charge transfer depends on the fusion orientation of the donor and acceptor motifs relative to the s&#8208;indacene core. The two most antiaromatic oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30 and 40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.

         <title>Promoting Alcohols Electrooxidation Coupled with Hydrogen Production via Asymmetric Pulse Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy was developed to promote the regeneration of active oxygen species which contribute to satble catalysis by noble metal catalysts for various alcohol oxidation reactions. Distinguished from conventional potentiostatic strategy, the operation time of stable glycerol oxidation electrocatalyzed by Pd was extended from 6&#8197;h to more than 2800&#8197;h under universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic organic oxidation coupled with hydrogen (H2) production emerges as a profitable solution to simultaneously reduce overall energy consumption of H2 production and synthetic high&#8208;value chemicals. Noble metal catalysts are highly efficient electrocatalysts in oxidation reactions, but they deactivate easily weakening the benefit in actual production. Herein, we report a universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy to achieve long&#8208;term stable operation of noble metals for various alcohol oxidation reactions and noble metal catalysts. For example, by pulsed potentials between 0.8&#8197;V and 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, palladium (Pd)&#8208;catalyzed glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation can continuously proceed for more than 2800&#8197;h with glyceric acid (GLA) selectivity of &gt;70&#8201;%. Whereas, Pd electrocatalyst becomes nearly deactivated within 6&#8197;h of reaction under conventional potentiostatic strategy. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated electrophilic OH* from H2O/OH&#8722; oxidation on Pd (denoted as Pd&#8722;OH*) acts as main active species for GLY oxidation. However, Pd&#8722;OH* is prone to be oxidized to PdOx resulting in performance decay. When a short reduction potential (e.g., 0&#8197;V vs. RHE for 5&#8197;s) is powered, PdOx can be reversibly reduced to restore the current. Moreover, we tested the feasibility of this strategy in a flow electrolyzer, verifying the practical application potential.

         <title>CO2 Reduction at a Borane&#8208;Modified Iron Complex: A Secondary Coordination Sphere Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bifunctional {Fe&#8208;H/Cp*&#8208;BCy2} (Cp* = C5Me5&#8722;) complex, which includes both iron&#8208;hydride and Lewis acid (borane) components, we demonstrate controlled CO2 reactivity to yield a formoxy borane&#8208;bound ferra(II)lactone [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5&#8208;CH2&#8208;CO2(BCy2O2CH))FeII(diphosphine)] that incorporates two equivalents of reduced CO2. With excess HBCy2, we additionally establish catalytic dihydroboration of CO2 to produce the bis&#8208;acetal, Cy2BOCH2OBCy2 at room temperature (TON = 220&#8197;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5&#8722;) &#8211; a well&#8208;studied family of organometallic complex &#8211; as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*&#8208;BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for transforming CO2 to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]. Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2 emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable &#8211; with such borane&#8208;containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal&#8208;ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.

         <title>Autocatalytic Nucleation and Self&#8208;Assembly of Inorganic Nanoparticles into Complex Biosimilar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoparticles multiply via autocatalytic nucleation. They also subsequently self&#8208;assemble into percolating chains via spatially restricted attachment. Structural analysis using graph theory (GT) reveals biomimetic organizational patterns akin to those found in biofilms. GT descriptors suggest a fundamental similarity in the mechanisms driving the emergence of complexity in both biological and abiological systems.







Abstract
Self&#8208;replication of bioorganic molecules and oil microdroplets have been explored as models in prebiotic chemistry. An analogous process for inorganic nanomaterials would involve the autocatalytic nucleation of metal, semiconductor, or ceramic nanoparticles&#8208;an area that remains largely uncharted.

&lt;p&gt;Silver nanoparticles multiply via autocatalytic nucleation. They also subsequently self-assemble into percolating chains via spatially restricted attachment. Structural analysis using graph theory (GT) reveals biomimetic organizational patterns akin to those found in biofilms. GT descriptors suggest a fundamental similarity in the mechanisms driving the emergence of complexity in both biological and abiological systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-replication of bioorganic molecules and oil microdroplets have been explored as models in prebiotic chemistry. An analogous process for inorganic nanomaterials would involve the autocatalytic nucleation of metal, semiconductor, or ceramic nanoparticles-an area that remains largely uncharted. Demonstrating such systems would be both fundamentally intriguing and practically relevant, especially if the resulting particles self-assemble into complex structures beyond the capabilities of molecules or droplets. Here, we show that autocatalytic nucleation occurs with silver nanoparticles, which subsequently self-assemble into chains through spatially restricted attachment. In dispersions containing &#8220;hedgehog&#8221; particles, these reactions produce complex colloids with hierarchical spike organization.

         <title>Constructing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Oxidative Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that demonstrate exceptional efficiency in H2O2 photosynthesis, coupled with the selective oxidation of organic molecules. These COFs have set a new benchmark for H2O2 production, achieving one of the highest performances reported to date. Additionally, they exhibit remarkable selectivity and yield in the oxidation of various organic substrates. This work represents a significant breakthrough in the development of COF&#8208;based photocatalytic platforms for dual&#8208;function co&#8208;production systems.







Abstract
The development of photocatalytic systems that enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 and value&#8208;added organic chemicals presents a dual advantage: generating valuable products while maximizing the utilization of solar energy. Despite the potential, there are relatively few reports on photocatalysts capable of such dual functions. In this study, we synthesized a series of donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as JUC&#8208;675 to JUC&#8208;677, to explore their photocatalytic efficiency in the co&#8208;production of H2O2 and N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine (BBAD). Among them, JUC&#8208;675 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 22.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 15.7&#8201;%, and its solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency was calculated to be 1.09&#8201;%, marking it as the most effective COF&#8208;based photocatalyst reported to date. Additionally, JUC&#8208;675 demonstrated a high selectivity (99.9&#8201;%) and yield (96&#8201;%) for BBAD in the oxidative coupling of benzylamine. The underlying reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated through validation experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the development of efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalytic platforms, offering new insights and methodologies for enhanced solar energy utilization and the synthesis of value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Unconventional Heterobidentate Coordination of 4&#8208;Hydroxypyridine Leading to Remarkably Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Zn(C5H4NO)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

Unusual heterobidentate coordination generates a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2, which shows a uniform alignment of microscopic polarization that generates the record&#8208;high bulk SHG among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unconventional heterobidentate coordination mode of conventional 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand in a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2. The strong heterobidentate coordination interactions between Zn2+ and 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands promote a uniform alignment of the polarization of each [ZnO2N2] tetrahedral building unit, resulting in remarkably strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) with an intensity that is the largest among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds reaching 13.6&#215;KDP. Moreover, Zn(C5H4NO)2 processes a suitable optical band gap of 4.40&#8197;eV, high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, excellent air stability, and strong water resistance, demonstrating great application potential. Additionally, Zn(C5H4NO)2 exhibits photoluminescence with a significantly enhanced lifetime of 558&#8197;ms, accompanied by a rare blue afterglow visible to the naked eye, lasting up to 5&#8197;s.

         <title>Non&#8208;Radical Mediated Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Conjugate&#8208;Enhanced Phenolic Resins with Ultrafast Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur&#8208;infused phenolic (RS) resin photocatalyst was meticulously designed at the molecular level to fine&#8208;tune its conjugation degree, thereby enhancing both its charge separation capability and hydrophilicity. This structural optimization enables the RS resin to achieve overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via non&#8208;radical pathways, resulting in an outstanding solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
It is essential for the development of highly efficient polymeric photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Nevertheless, the non&#8208;uniform molecular structures and sluggish reaction pathway of polymeric photocatalysts lead to low conversion efficiency. In this work, we report sulfur&#8208;contained phenolic resins with regulated conjugation for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Due to the substitution of sulfur for methylene in the phenolic resin structure, the conjugation degree of the material is adjusted, resulting in the formation of a built&#8208;in electric field. This effectively enhances the charge separation capability, enabling charge carriers to react faster with substrates. Through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we have unveiled that the introduction of sulfur can modulate the reaction pathway of phenolic resin materials, enabling a dual&#8208;pathway photocatalytic H2O2 production mediated by non&#8208;radical species. Impressively, the sulfur&#8208;contained resin photocatalyst showcases exceptional H2O2 production activity with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4&#8201;% exceeding most reported systems, and generates 25&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 of H2O2 under natural sunlight through large&#8208;scale equipment. This work provides a facile strategy to separate the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs of polymer photocatalysts to achieve efficient artificial photosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
The first wide&#8208;view image of multiple structural and phase transformations in MOFs is presented by Ming&#8208;Hua Zeng and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202411150). The MOFs exhibit dynamic chemistry covering crystal&#8208;crystal and crystal&#8208;amorphous&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal evolution. The disordered hierarchical pores in amorphous and glassy MOFs enable efficient separation of C2H2/C2H4 and C3H6/C3H8 gases mixtures.

A novel approach to H2 extraction from liquid organic hydrocarbon carriers (LOHCs) using ultralow loading of Pt nanoparticles on a modified alumina structure with an ALD&#8208;titanium oxide shell is shown by Yongmin Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202417598). This unique catalyst design efficiently releases hydrogen from LOHCs, outperforming equivalent Pt and commercial catalysts. The ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell enhances the catalytic activity while minimizing Pt usage.

Non&#8208;stoichiometric cocrystals of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework were constructed from two tetracarboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores. The single crystals showed versatile fluorescence, including not only homogeneous color such as purple, blue, green and white, but also heterogeneous bicolor such as blue&#8208;green and green&#8208;yellow depending on the component ratios and distributions. In their Research Article (e202419992), Ichiro Hisaki, Abderrazzak Douhal and co&#8208;workers revealed the relationship between crystal structures and fluorescent properties of single crystals.

Bifunctional complex design can enable selective activation of the strong C=O bonds in CO2. Much like a fiddler crab, the {Fe&#8208;H/Cp*&#8208;BCy2} complex employed by Marcus W. Drover and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202421599), features two distinct &#8221;claws&#8220; This study highlights that cooperativity between the iron hydride and pendant Lewis acidic borane is integral to facilitate the reduction of CO2 to a C1 product.

Br&#248;nsted Photoacids and Photobases represent a unique class capable of donating or accepting a proton only after excitation. Here, we review the utilization of such molecules to light&#8208;trigger the direction and amplitude of functional dynamic systems. We discuss the guidelines of how to use such molecules in various systems and give a futuristic outlook on the current technology gap for further utilization.







Abstract
Br&#248;nsted photoacids and photobases are a unique class of molecules that undergo a major change in their pKa values between their ground and excited states, resulting in donating or accepting a proton, respectively, but only after light excitation. This property of photoacids/photobases makes them an attractive tool for light&#8208;gating various dynamic processes. Here, we review the use of this property to manipulate functional dynamic systems with light. We discuss how a proton transfer event that can happen upon light excitation from a photoacid to a chemical moiety of a certain system or, vice versa, from the system to a photobase, can result in a shift in the equilibrium of the system, resulting in some dynamicity. We detail various systems, including self&#8208;assembly processes of nanostructures, self&#8208;propulsion of droplets, catalysis for hydrogen evolution or CO2 capturing, nanotechnological devices based on enzymatic processes, and changes in proton&#8208;conducting ionophores and materials. We detail the basic guidelines for using Br&#248;nsted photoacids and photobases in a desired system and conclude with the current technological gaps in further using these molecules.

         <title>Photoinduced Late&#8208;Stage Radical Decarboxylative and Deoxygenative Coupling of Complex Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylic acids serve as versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. This review highlights recent developments and trends in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by visible light photocatalysis. It discusses a variety of radical decarboxylative and deoxygenative coupling reactions, with particular emphasis on the reaction mechanisms involved, as well as potential future directions for the field.







Abstract
The simple and efficient conversion of carboxylic acids into structurally diverse organic molecules is highly desirable in chemical synthesis. This review covers recent developments in photocatalytic methodology for late&#8208;stage transformations of complex carboxylic acids and their derivatives enabled by radical decarboxylation and deoxygenation, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advancements are categorized based on the reactivity patterns exhibited by the carboxylic acids. Several activation modes to generate alkyl or aryl radical intermediates during decarboxylation of carboxylic acids are presented, namely, single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), SET reduction, and energy transfer (EnT) processes. On the other hand, direct activation of C&#8722;O bonds in carboxylic acids mediated by phosphoranyl radicals has been discussed and illustrates their potential synthetic application for the synthesis of complex aldehydes, ketones and amides.

Fasten your seat belt! Choose lightning&#8208;speed, photoactivated journeys for complexes by selecting the metal, its oxidation state, ligands and geometry. Track complexes through excited singlet (S) states, intersystem crossing (ISC) to triplet (T) states, energy/charge&#8208;transfer, luminescence, ligand substitutions and redox reactions. Pathways to novel drugs with new mechanisms of action. Unravelling excited metallomics on the way is challenging.







Abstract
Photoactivatable metal complexes offer the prospect of novel drugs with low side effects and new mechanisms of action to combat resistance to current therapy. We highlight recent progress in the design of platinum, ruthenium, iridium, gold and other transition metal complexes, especially for applications as anticancer and anti&#8208;infective agents. In particular, understanding excited state chemistry related to identification of the bioactive species (excited state metallomics/pharmacophores) is important. Photoactivatable metallodrugs are classified here as photocatalysts, photorelease agents and ligand&#8208;activated agents. Their activation wavelengths, cellular mechanisms of action, experimental and theoretical metallomics of excited states and photoproducts are discussed to explore new strategies for the design and investigation of photoactivatable metallodrugs. These photoactivatable metallodrugs have potential in clinical applications of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), Photoactivated Chemotherapy (PACT) and Photothermal Therapy (PTT).

         <title>Deciphering Polymer Interactions in Bioconjugates with Different Architectures by Structural Analysis via Time&#8208;Resolved Limited Proteolysis Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative time&#8208;resolved limited proteolysis (LiP) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to decipher interferon alpha 2a (IFN) interactions using &#8220;heavy&#8221; 15N&#8208;IFN wild type as an internal standard. We monitor tryptic cleavage dynamics of specific protein&#8208;protein interactions and transient non&#8208;specific polymer&#8208;protein interactions (IFN&#8208;bioconjugates) with different polymer architectures and click handles. LIP&#8208;MS may result in an enhanced future understanding of transient interactions&#8208;landscapes of bioconjugates.







Abstract
Therapeutic proteins are commonly conjugated with polymers to modulate their pharmacokinetics but often lack a description of the polymer&#8208;protein interaction. We deployed limited proteolysis mass spectrometry (LiP&#8208;MS) to reveal the interaction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PEG alternative polymers with interferon&#8208;&#945;2a (IFN). Target conjugates were digested with the specific protease trypsin and a &#8220;heavy&#8221; 15N&#8208;IFN wild type (IFN&#8208;WT) for time&#8208;resolved quantification of the cleavage dynamics. Interactions between IFN&#8208;&#945;2a and its high&#8208;affinity receptor were detailed by LiP&#8208;MS. Then, 10&#8197;kDa polymers of PEG, linear polyglycerol (LPG), and poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) (POX) with two different cyclooctyne linkers (BCN/DBCO) were used for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation to azide functionalized IFN&#8208;&#945;2a. Tryptic events at each cleavage site and in different structural environments (loops/helices) were compared. PEG and LPG were similar, and POX showed a reduced interaction profile with the IFN&#8208;&#945;2a surface. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations of IFN&#8208;DBCO&#8208;polymer conjugates revealed distinct and transient (below 50&#8197;ns) protein&#8208;interaction profiles for PEG, LPG, and POX. Cleavage dynamics of IFN&#8208;polymer conjugates from the BCN handle were homogeneous, pointing to a more conserved IFN structure than DBCO&#8208;polymer conjugates. In summary, time&#8208;resolved LiP&#8208;MS for quantification of cleavage events enhances the structural understanding of transient IFN&#8208;polymer interactions, which may be extended to other bioconjugate types.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a selenium&#8208;substitution strategy, a new selenium&#8208;based ligand, tetraseleno&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ), was synthesized, leading to the construction of a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer (Ag4TSHQ). Ag4TSHQ shares the same topological structure as its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ, but exhibits superior charge mobility of approximately 350&#8197;cm2/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of Ag4TTHQ. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced electrochemical energy storage capabilities. This research underscores the advantages of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) in optoelectronic devices and energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs), a novel class of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron&#8208;rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high&#8208;mobility semiconducting c&#8208;CPs. Despite their potential, c&#8208;CPs incorporating selenium&#8208;substituted ligands remain scarce due to the synthetic challenges associated with both the ligands and the coordination polymers. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraselenol&#8208;hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer, Ag4TSHQ. Ag4TSHQ exhibits room&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6&#8197;S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag4TTHQ (TTHQ=tetrathiol&#8208;hydroxyquinone), enabling precise band gap modulation from 0.6&#8197;eV to 1.5&#8197;eV via a mixed&#8208;ligand approach. Time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag4TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag4TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag4TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340&#8197;F/g&#8208;significantly outperforming Ag4TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294&#8197;F/g. These findings underscore the potential of selenium&#8208;ligand&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs for optoelectronic applications and energy storage technologies.

     alt="Selenium-Substitution Strategy for Enhanced Mobility, Tunable Bandgap, and Improved Electrochemical Energy Storage in Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a selenium-substitution strategy, a new selenium-based ligand, tetraseleno-hydroxyquinone (TSHQ), was synthesized, leading to the construction of a semiconducting three-dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer (Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ). Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ shares the same topological structure as its sulfur counterpart, Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ, but exhibits superior charge mobility of approximately 350&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V&#8901;s, which is twice that of Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced electrochemical energy storage capabilities. This research underscores the advantages of selenium-ligand-based coordination polymers (c-CPs) in optoelectronic devices and energy storage technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated coordination polymers (c-CPs), a novel class of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials, are distinguished by their unique structural characteristics and exceptional charge transport properties. The electronic properties of these materials are critically determined by the constituting coordination atoms, with electron-rich selenol ligands emerging as promising candidates for constructing high-mobility semiconducting c-CPs. Despite their potential, c-CPs incorporating selenium-substituted ligands remain scarce due to the synthetic challenges associated with both the ligands and the coordination polymers. In this study, we successfully synthesized a new tetraselenol-hydroxyquinone (TSHQ) ligand using a &#8220;4+2&#8221; design strategy and developed a semiconducting three-dimensional Ag&#8722;Se coordination polymer, Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ. Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ exhibits room-temperature electrical conductivity of up to 1.6&#8197;S/m and shares the same structural topology as Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ (TTHQ=tetrathiol-hydroxyquinone), enabling precise band gap modulation from 0.6&#8197;eV to 1.5&#8197;eV via a mixed-ligand approach. Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy reveals that the charge mobility of Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ in the dc limit is ~350&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s, which is twice that of its sulfur counterpart, Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ. Furthermore, our evaluations of their electrochemical energy storage capabilities demonstrate that Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TSHQ effectively utilizes its redox potential, achieving a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 340&#8197;F/g-significantly outperforming Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TTHQ, which has a capacitance of 294&#8197;F/g.

         <title>Rapid N2O Formation from N2 on Water Droplet Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen (N2) is regarded as a stable reservoir for the N element in the atmosphere. However, this study finds that the stable N2 can rapidly react with atmospheric oxygen and ozone on ubiquitous water droplet surfaces via a novel reduction&#8208;then&#8208;oxidation pathway, resulting in the formation of nitrous oxide &#8211; the third most impactful greenhouse gas.







Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) has long been considered as stable atmospheric reservoir for N element and has a persistence time of hundreds of years. This study reveals that oxygen (O2) at typical tropospheric concentrations can rapidly activate N2, leading to substantial production of nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most impactful greenhouse gas, at rates approaching 2.83&#177;0.41 ppmv hour&#8722;1 catalyzed by ubiquitous water droplets in experimental systems. Notably, ozone (O3), typically consumed by N2O in the stratosphere, can further accelerate N2O formation. In contrast, the produced N2O concentration is below detection limits in the absence of O2/O3 or water droplets. A novel reduction&#8208;then&#8208;oxidation (RTO) mechanism was proposed to account for the rapid formation of N2O on the water droplet surfaces facilitated by the cooperation of water droplets and O2/O3. Further extrapolation indicates that the RTO pathway contributes several Tg N N2O annually, far exceeding the most known sources of N2O. These findings have broad implications for tracing atmospheric N2O sources, enhancing understanding of climate&#8208;O2/O3 interactions, and paving avenues for developing new methodologies for N2O synthesis.

         <title>Identification of Oligosaccharide Isomers Using Electrostatically Asymmetric OmpF Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, the OmpF nanopore, was developed for detecting unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides at low concentrations.







Abstract
Glycans, unlike uniformly charged DNA and compositionally diverse peptides, are typically uncharged and possess rich stereoisomeric diversity in the glycosidic bonds between two monosaccharide units. These unique features, including charge heterogeneity and structural complexity, pose significant challenges for accurate analysis. Herein, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule oligosaccharide sensor, OmpF nanopore. The natural electroosmotic flow within OmpF generates a robust driving force for unlabeled neutral oligosaccharides, enabling detection at a concentration as low as 6.4&#8197;&#956;M. Furthermore, the asymmetric constriction zone of OmpF was employed to construct a stereoselective recognition site, enabling sensitive identification of glycosidic bond differences in cell lysate samples. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the OmpF nanopore achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.9&#8201;% for tetrasaccharides differing in only one glycosidic bond was achieved. This nanopore sensor provides a highly sensitive analytical tool with a broad dynamic range. It enables chiral recognition of oligosaccharides at low concentrations and is suitable for analysing both low&#8208;abundance and practical samples.

A robust regio&#8208; and stereoselective ROP approach was developed for the synthesis of isoenriched alt&#8208;PLGA (Regioselectivity up to 97&#8201;%, Pm up to 0.91) from rac&#8208;MG by the exploit of our spiro&#8208;salen scandium complexes, which represents a versatile platform for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability.







Abstract
Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed for various biomedical applications owing to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. The discovery of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric alternating PLGA pairs underscored its potential as high&#8208;performance biodegradable materials with diverse material properties and biodegradability. Herein, we have established a regio&#8208; and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach for the synthesis of stereocomplexed isoenriched alternating PLGA from racemic methyl&#8208;glycolide (rac&#8208;MG). The high sequence and tacticity control was accomplished by an optimized enantiopure scandium catalyst bearing a spiro&#8208;salen scaffold. Varying polymer stereoregularity Pm from 0.4 to 0.91 led to a transformation of the resulting alternating PLGA from amorphous to semicrystalline materials. Notably, the stereocomplexed alternating PLGA demonstrated enhanced melting transition temperature (Tm up to 191&#8201;&#176;C) and crystallization rate. This regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled polymerization represented a versatile approach for the preparation of high&#8208;performance biodegradable PLGA materials.

         <title>Precise Identification of Native Peptides with Posttranslational Proline Hydroxylation by Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally engineered nanopore was constructed to directly discriminate posttranslational proline hydroxylation in native peptides. By modeling the specific binding structure, hydrophobic region was introduced into aerolysin to transduce the hydrophobicity difference induced by hydroxylation. Precise identification of proline hydroxylation in hypoxia&#8208;induced factor protein was achieved without interference from adjacent oxidation.







Abstract
Hydroxylation, an extensive post&#8208;translational modification on proline, is critical for the modulation of native protein structures, further dominating their functions in life systems. However, current mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based identification, could hardly distinguish hydroxylation with the neighboring oxidation due to the same mass shifts, as well as challenges posed by low abundance and exogenous oxidation during sample preparation. To address this, an engineered nanopore was designed, capable of discriminating single hydroxyl group on proline, to achieve the identification of proline hydroxylation on individual native peptides directly in mixture. By modeling the interaction between hydroxylated proline and its specific recognition protein, we introduced a hydrophobic region in aerolysin lumen with A224Y/T274W mutations to enhance the sensitivity for proline residue. The results showed that the proline hydroxylation on native HIF&#8208;1&#945; fragments could be unambiguously identified without purification, which could be maintained even in the presence of neighboring oxidation. The voltage&#8208;dependent experiments further demonstrated the more relaxed peptide structure induced by hydroxylation that supported the great impact of hydroxylation on chemical properties of proline and the molecular mechanism of the specific recognition for hydroxylated proline in nature. These findings highlight the potential of nanopore for precise hydroxylation detection, offering a reliable platform for further uncovering the related functions in biological systems.

     alt="Precise Identification of Native Peptides with Posttranslational Proline Hydroxylation by Nanopore"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rationally engineered nanopore was constructed to directly discriminate posttranslational proline hydroxylation in native peptides. By modeling the specific binding structure, hydrophobic region was introduced into aerolysin to transduce the hydrophobicity difference induced by hydroxylation. Precise identification of proline hydroxylation in hypoxia-induced factor protein was achieved without interference from adjacent oxidation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroxylation, an extensive post-translational modification on proline, is critical for the modulation of native protein structures, further dominating their functions in life systems. However, current mass spectrometry (MS)-based identification, could hardly distinguish hydroxylation with the neighboring oxidation due to the same mass shifts, as well as challenges posed by low abundance and exogenous oxidation during sample preparation. To address this, an engineered nanopore was designed, capable of discriminating single hydroxyl group on proline, to achieve the identification of proline hydroxylation on individual native peptides directly in mixture. By modeling the interaction between hydroxylated proline and its specific recognition protein, we introduced a hydrophobic region in aerolysin lumen with A224Y/T274W mutations to enhance the sensitivity for proline residue. The results showed that the proline hydroxylation on native HIF-1&#945; fragments could be unambiguously identified without purification, which could be maintained even in the presence of neighboring oxidation. The voltage-dependent experiments further demonstrated the more relaxed peptide structure induced by hydroxylation that supported the great impact of hydroxylation on chemical properties of proline and the molecular mechanism of the specific recognition for hydroxylated proline in nature. These findings highlight the potential of nanopore for precise hydroxylation detection, offering a reliable platform for further uncovering the related functions in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Trifluoromethylazidation of Styrenyl Olefins Catalyzed by an Engineered Nonheme Iron Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic platform for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes has been successfully established. Through 11 rounds of directed evolution, an engineered variant of nonheme iron enzyme, BsQueD&#8208;CF3, was developed, enabling the production of a wide range of enantioenriched CF3&#8208;containing molecules. This platform based on metalloenzymes would open a new avenue for biocatalytic trifluoromethylation chemistry.







Abstract
Organofluorines, particularly those containing trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, play a critical role in medicinal chemistry. While trifluoromethylation of alkenes provides a powerful synthetic route to construct CF3&#8208;containing compounds with broad structural and functional diversity, achieving enantioselective control in these reactions remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we engineered a nonheme iron enzyme, quercetin 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsQueD), for the enantioselective trifluoromethylazidation of alkenes. Through directed evolution, the final variant BsQueD&#8208;CF3 exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of radical intermediates. This work expands biocatalytic organofluorine chemistry by reprogramming metalloenzymes for innovative trifluoromethylation reactions.

         <title>A Trithia&#8208;Bridged N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: The Hitherto Missing Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented triphenylamine with three sulfur ortho bridges has been developed as the very first representative of the hitherto elusive family of electron donors. The compound is readily oxidized to the corresponding radical cation with exceptional stability and forms crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with cyano&#8208;based acceptors.







Abstract
The very first representative of trithia&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene, a triphenylamine with sulfur atoms bridging the ortho&#8208;positions, was synthesized by a sequence of regioselective sulfenylation with phthalimidesulfenyl chloride followed by Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the polycyclic scaffold. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the optoelectronic properties. The title compound is a particularly strong electron donor forming a perfectly stable radical cation, which was analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron donor properties were further highlighted by the formation of crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors.

         <title>Secupyritines A&#8208;C, Three Natural Propellane Securinega Alkaloids: Structure Elucidation and Total Synthesis Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel polycyclic pyridine alkaloids (1&#8208;3) featuring a unique 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;6&#8208;aza[4.4.3]propellane skeleton were discovered from the twigs and leaves of Flueggea suffruticosa. Guided by a synthesis strategy based on the biogenetic building blocks, the first total synthesis of 1&#8208;3 was achieved through vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reaction, Suzuki coupling reaction, and intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction as key steps.







Abstract
Secupyritines A&#8208;C are unique polycyclic Securinega alkaloids isolated from medicinal plant Flueggea suffruticosa. They feature a distinctive 6/6/6/5/6 fused pentacyclic ring system with a highly strained 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;6&#8208;aza[4.4.3]propellane core. Their structures with absolute configurations were elucidated through a comprehensive approach involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and total synthesis. The total synthesis of secupyritines A&#8208;C was achieved in 14 or 16 steps, employing a synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks. Key elements of the synthetic procedures include a vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reaction to construct the sp3&#8208;sp2 attached&#8208;ring system, a Suzuki coupling reaction to build the piperidine ring, and an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction to establish the propellane skeleton. Formal asymmetric synthesis of secupyritines A&#8208;C was also presented.

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides has been developed, directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. The backbone&#8208;installed directing group facilitates site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides, including at internal residues. Removal of the amidoxime ether generates the parent amide enabling a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.







Abstract
Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted considerable attention as a pathway to late&#8208;stage modification of peptides. Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including unprecedented functionalization of internal residues of native peptides. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8722;H functionalization process.

         <title>Design of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Domain Antibodies via a Genetically Encoded &#946;&#8208;Lactam Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>

A genetically encoded &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;lysine (BeLaK) enables a spontaneous inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with a proximal lysine in a supercharged monobody, affording a rigidified cell&#8208;penetrating variant with enhanced thermostability, greater cellular uptake, and potent inhibitory activity.







Abstract
Domain antibodies such as monobodies provide an attractive immunoglobin fold for evolving high&#8208;affinity protein binders targeting the intracellular proteins implicated in cell signalling. However, it remains a challenge to endow cell permeability to these small and versatile protein binders. Here, we report a streamlined approach combining orthogonal crosslinking afforded by a genetically encoded &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;lysine (BeLaK) and genetic supercharging to generate cell&#8208;penetrating monobodies. When introduced to the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;strand of a series of supercharged monobodies, BeLaK enabled efficient inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with the neighbouring lysine. Compared to its non&#8208;crosslinked counterpart, a BeLaK&#8208;crosslinked, +18&#8208;charged monobody exhibited enhanced thermostability and greater cellular uptake at 40&#8197;nM. Moreover, this structurally rigidified, supercharged monobody inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in KYSE&#8208;520 esophageal cancer cell line at sub&#8208;micromolar concentration, indicating significant endosomal escape after endocytosis. Together, the discovery of this BeLaK&#8208;encoded, rigidified immunoglobin fold should facilitate the design of cell&#8208;penetrating monobodies targeting intracellular signalling proteins.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway in Dual Dynamic Covalent Polymeric Systems</title>

&#8220;One monomer for two materials&#8221;: Dual dynamic covalent chemistries diversify the pathway of molecular self&#8208;assembly and produce distinct polymeric materials as a function of evaporation rate.







Abstract
Kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly is garnering increasing interest in the field of supramolecular polymers and materials, yet examples involving dynamic covalent exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here we report an unexpected dynamic covalent polymeric system whose aqueous self&#8208;assembly pathway is strongly influenced by the kinetics of evaporation of water. The key design is to integrate dual dynamic covalent bonds&#8212;including disulfide bonds and boroxine/borate&#8212;into a dynamic equilibrium system of monomers, polymers, and materials. This dual dynamic covalent design allows polymer growth and crosslinking to occur with the same spatiotemporal characteristics, governed solely by solvent evaporation. We found that a single building block can assemble into two distinct types of polymeric materials, each characterized by unique crosslinking topologies, orders, solubility, and macroscopic properties. The dual dynamic nature of the materials imparts them with intrinsic reconfigurability, such as interfacial repairability and close&#8208;loop chemical recyclability.

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Unprecedent Layered Perovskite&#8208;Type Heterostructure Ferroelectric via Chemical Molecular Scissor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode. This work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.







Abstract
Precise stacking of distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rigid slabs to build heterostructures has renewed the portfolio of 2D materials, e.g., magic&#8208;angle graphene, due to the emergence of exotic physical properties. Recently, single&#8208;crystal heterostructures of layered perovskites have emerged as an exciting branch, while it remains scarce to achieve strong ferroelectricity in this new heterostructure family. Here, we present the first ferroelectric of 2D perovskite heterostructures as single crystal, (EA3Pb2Br7)EA4Pb3Br10 (1, EA=ethylamine), by precisely tailoring inorganic sheets via a chemical molecular scissor. It has notable ferroelectricity of large spontaneous polarization (Ps~5.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and high Curie temperature (Tc~375&#8197;K). Structurally, its inorganic framework adopts a unique 2D heterostructure that contains two different rigid slabs of {EA3Pb2Br7}n and {EA4Pb3Br10}n. This motif is self&#8208;assembled by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer clipping of rigid prototype sheets, using extra neopentylamine as a molecular chemical scissor. Unlike epitaxial growth, such a molecule&#8208;level stacking facilitates the growth of heterostructure single crystals. Combining its strong ferroelectricity and inherent anisotropy, crystal&#8208;based device of 1 exhibits an ultrahigh polarized&#8208;light sensitivity up to ~37 in self&#8208;powered mode, being the highest level of 2D perovskite ferroelectric family. Our work will facilitate the further development of ferroelectric materials for optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Anion Transport by Bambusuril&#8208;Bile Acid Conjugates: Drastic Effect of the Cholesterol Content</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bambusuril macrocycles were functionalized with bile acids of different polarities and studied as anion transporters. The bambusuril with the most polar bile acids was demonstrated to form a unimolecular anion channel. Furthermore, increasing the cholesterol content in the membrane of liposomes drastically decreased the ion transport activity, likely squeezing the bile acid arms together to close the channel.







Abstract
Artificial anion transporters offer a potential way to treat deficiencies in cellular anion transport of genetic origins. In contrast to the large variety of mobile anion carriers and self&#8208;assembled anion channels reported, unimolecular anion channels are less investigated. Herein, we present a unique example of a unimolecular anion channel based on a bambusuril (BU) macrocycle, a well&#8208;established anion receptor. The BU structure was expanded by appending various bile acid residues allowing a single molecule to span the membrane. Chloride transport mediated by BUs through lipid bilayers was investigated in liposomes and these studies revealed a surprisingly high dependence of the anion transport activity on the cholesterol content in the liposomal membrane.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Modulation of Li+ Solvation Structures towards Optimal Electrolyte Systems for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte has been successfully developed by aid of machine learning, which can show anion&#8208;induced ion&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordinated structures. As a result, a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI could be formed on anode, while large sized Li2O2 particles on cathode by regulating the growth pathway, enabling exceptional Li&#8722;O2 battery performance. These findings highlight the critical role of solvation structures and provide valuable theoretical guidance for rational design of next&#8208;generation electrolyte systems.







Abstract
As the &#8220;blood&#8221; of Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs), electrolytes with various solvation structures of Li+ can greatly influence the composition of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and the growth kinetics of Li2O2 on cathode, and further the battery performance. However, achieving delicate modulation of the multi&#8208;composition electrolytes remains significantly challenging to simultaneously give consideration to both the anode and cathode reactions. In this work, we employed Bayesian optimization to develop advanced electrolytes for LOBs, enabling the formation of a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, and modulation of Li2O2 morphologies. Thus obtained LOBs using the optimized dual&#8208;solvent electrolyte could deliver a discharge capacity of 14,063&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is far higher than those using the single&#8208;solvent electrolytes. This study not only highlights the critical role of the solvation structure for improving the battery performance, but also provides new insights and important theoretical guidance for delicate modulation of electrolyte compositions.

         <title>Electrochemical Cyclopropanation of Unactivated Alkenes with Methylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 9, February 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient method for the organo&#8208;mediated electrooxidative cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with methylene compounds has been developed. The method shows excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope that can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of biorelevant compounds.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive compounds, functioning as a significant structural motif. Although a series of methods have been developed for the construction of the cyclopropane skeleton, the development of a direct and efficient strategy for the rapid synthesis of cyclopropanes from bench&#8208;stable starting materials with a broad substrate scope and functional group tolerance remains challenging and highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the direct cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes using active methylene compounds. The strategy shows a broad substrate scope with a high level of functional group compatibility, as well as potential application as demonstrated by late&#8208;stage cyclopropanation of complex molecules and drug derivatives. Further mechanistic investigations suggest that Cp2Fe (Fc) plays an essential role as an oxidative mediator in generating radicals from active methylene compounds.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active 2&#8208;aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8208;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Electrochemical Biomass Oxidation and CO2 Reduction over Ultra&#8208;wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6 V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98% even after 100 hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal ionic conduction through polymer films due to nano confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic and selectivity of ionic conduction through polymer films is a key factor in the function of many systems including membrane technology, energy devices, sensors, and corrosion. Typically, the ionic conduction is accelerated by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. However, counterintuitively, polymer films with very high electrochemical impedance demonstrate the opposite effect, i.e. ionic conduction slows down by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. This bimodal nature of ionic conduction was discovered five decades ago and yet the mechanism has remained poorly understood. This minireview explains the long&#8208;standing anomaly through the lens of recent advances in nano&#8208;confinement electrochemistry. Emerging evidence shows that changes in solvation shells occurs due to the size of the channel through which ionic diffusion takes place. These solvation shells can significantly affect the mobility of ions, their interactions with functional groups of the polymer, and the overall conductivity of the electrolyte. At dimensions only a few nanometers, partially hydrated ions form stronger bonds with polymer slowing down the ionic conduction. Increasing ionic strength will add ion&#8208;pairing interactions further reducing ions mobility. The interplay of solvated ions, polymer chemistry, and ionic content offer an explanation for the anomalous bimodal ionic conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate Aldolase for anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99:1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99:1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.</dc:description>

Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non-natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes.

         <title>Photogeneration and visualization of a surface&#8208;stabilized dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.</dc:description>
