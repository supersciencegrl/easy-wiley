         <title>Subnanometric Bismuth Clusters Confined in Pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 Enable Remarkable CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient photocatalysts for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) into chemical fuels is of great importance for energy sustainability and carbon resource utilization. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for in&#8208;situ construction of subnanometric Bi metallic clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 frameworks, leading to the remarkable improvements of photocatalytic performances for CO2 reduction into CO in the absence of sacrificial reagent. More specifically, an outstanding CO evolution activity of 114.1 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1 has been achieved, more than 20&#8208;fold improvement compared with the pristine Bi2Sn2O7 (5.7 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1). Detailed experiments together with in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the spatially confined Bi clusters could significantly promote charge&#8208;separation/electron&#8208;enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, which provides highly efficient reaction channels to facilitate the generation of *COOH intermediate as well as the subsequent desorption of *CO towards CO formation. These demonstrations provide an important knowledge for precise design and fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion into solar fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminophore for Activatable Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow luminescence imaging probes, with long&#8208;lived emission after cessation of light excitation, have drawn increasing attention in biomedical imaging field. However, current afterglow agents always suffer from an unsatisfactory signal intensity and complex systems consisting of multiple ingredients. To address these issues, this study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow luminophore (TPP&#8208;DO) by chemical conjugation of an afterglow substrate and a photosensitizer acting as both an afterglow initiator and an energy relay unit into a single molecule, resulting in an intramolecular energy transfer process to improve the afterglow brightness. The constructed TPP&#8208;DO NPs emit a strong NIR afterglow luminescence with a signal intensity of up to 108 p/s/cm2/sr at a low concentration of 10 &#956;M and a low irradiation power density of 0.05 W/cm2, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than most existing organic afterglow probes. The highly bright NIR afterglow luminescence with minimized background from TPP&#8208;DO NPs allows a deep tissue penetration depth of 6 cm thickness. Moreover, we develop a GSH&#8208;activatable afterglow probe (Q&#8208;TPP&#8208;DO NPs) for ultrasensitive detection of subcutaneous tumor with the smallest tumor volume of 0.048 mm3, demonstrating the high potential for early diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided surgical resection of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Modulated 2D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis under Air and Pure Water Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2O2 is a widely used eco&#8208;friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from water and O2 is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues.Three zig&#8208;zag two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX&#8208;dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H2O2 photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr&#8208;dptz exhibits a H2O2 production rate high up to 1874 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O2. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X = Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity.This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H2O2 production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in&#8208;situ H2O2 photosynthesis devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanoinhibitor Targeting cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Reverse the Homeostatic Imbalance of Inflammation in Psoriasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by dysregulated crosstalk between immune cells and keratinocytes. Here we show that the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a key regulator of psoriatic inflammation in a mouse model. Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) were designed to inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. By inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages was reduced, and the proinflammatory cytokines&#8208;induced breakdown of immunological tolerance and overexpression of chemokines in keratinocytes was restored, which reversed the homeostatic imbalance through breaking these cytokines&#8208;mediated intercellular positive feedback loop. Topical Pt&#8208;CDs treatment exhibited therapeutic effects in imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mice without noticeable toxicity. The reversal of elevated expression of STING, phosphorylated STING, and downstream genes within psoriatic lesions indicates that Pt&#8208;CDs effectively inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. This work suggests a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment by targeting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs nanoinhibitor to restore skin homeostatic balance.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning on Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Photo&#8208;Oxidation by Outer&#8208;Sphere Microenvironment Modulation in Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is ubiquitously involved in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, efficient and selective production of 1O2 is still challenging. Herein, we reported the synthesis of nickel porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating functional groups with different electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing features on their pore walls. These functional groups established a dedicated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment surrounding the Ni catalytic center that tunes the activity of the COFs for 1O2&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation. With the increase of the electron&#8208;donating ability of functional groups, the modulated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment turns on the catalytic activity from a yield of nearly zero by the cyano group functionalized COF to an excellent yield of 98% by the methoxy group functionalized one. Electronic property investigation and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the distinct excitonic behaviors attributed to the diverse band energy levels and orbital composition are responsible for the discriminative activity. This study represents the first regulation of generating reactive oxygen species based on the strategy of outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment modulation in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer&#8208;based sensor for use in 19F MRI. DNC consists of core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19F&#8208;MSNs), which give a robust 19F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19F&#8208;MSNs. The probe functions as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor using target&#8208;induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept (DNCThr), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human &#945;&#8208;thrombin. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.</dc:description>

Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot-spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD2Cl2 and 1,1&#8208;dichloroethane, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8208;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8208;S bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Modification Strategy to Modulate Reaction Microenvironment for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of the microenvironment on the electrode surface is one of the effective means to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (eCO&#8322;RR). To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO&#8322;&#160;solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment&#160;by one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The superhydrophobic Cu&#8208;based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C&#8322;H&#8324;) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H&#8208;type cell, which is 2.5 times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO&#8322;RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited. This strategy has the potential to be applied to other gas&#8208;conversion electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8208;, Mo6O228&#8208; and Mo7O258&#8208;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8208;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster.  The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg  produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiolation for Enhancing Photostability of Fluorophores at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule imaging can elucidate the intricate biomolecular dynamics in vivo. We present a straightforward thiolation of squaraine that enhances its photobleaching lifetime by approximately fivefold at the single molecule level. This advancement allows for extended single&#8208;molecule tracking of the membrane protein CD56 in live cells, effectively tripling the duration of our observations.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes are essential for single&#8208;molecule imaging. However, their application in biological systems is often limited by the short photobleaching lifetime. To overcome this, we developed a novel thiolation strategy for squaraine dyes. By introducing thiolation of the central cyclobutene of squaraine (thio&#8208;squaraine), we observed a &#8776;5&#8208;fold increase in photobleaching lifetime. Our single&#8208;molecule data analysis attributes this improvement to improved photostability resulting from thiolation. Interestingly, bulk measurements show rapid oxidation of thio&#8208;squaraine to its oxo&#8208;analogue under irradiation, giving the perception of inferior photostability. This discrepancy between bulk and single&#8208;molecule environments can be ascribed to the factors in the latter, including larger intermolecular distances and restricted mobility, which reduce the interactions between a fluorophore and reactive oxygen species produced by other fluorophores, ultimately impacting photobleaching and photoconversion rate. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of thio&#8208;squaraine probes in various imaging buffers, such as glucose oxidase with catalase (GLOX) and GLOX+trolox. We successfully employed these photostable probes for single&#8208;molecule tracking of CD56 membrane protein and monitoring mitochondria movements in live neurons. CD56 tracking revealed distinct motion states and the corresponding protein fractions. This investigation is expected to propel the development of single&#8208;molecule imaging probes, particularly in scenarios where bulk measurements show suboptimal performance.

         <title>Reconstitution of the Final Steps in the Biosynthesis of Valanimycin Reveals the Origin of Its Characteristic Azoxy Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis have been reconstituted in vitro. The oxidation of a dialkyl hydrazine intermediate to the characteristic azoxy moiety in valanimycin is catalyzed by VlmB, which is a non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme. The VlmB&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;electron oxidation may commence with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex without prior reduction.







Abstract
Valanimycin is an azoxy&#8208;containing natural product isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456&#8208;hF10. While the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been partially characterized, how the azoxy group is constructed remains obscure. Herein, the membrane protein VlmO and the putative hydrazine synthetase ForJ from the formycin biosynthetic pathway are demonstrated to catalyze N&#8722;N bond formation converting O&#8208;(l&#8208;seryl)&#8208;isobutyl hydroxylamine into N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;l&#8208;serine. Subsequent installation of the azoxy group is shown to be catalyzed by the non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme VlmB in a reaction in which the N&#8722;N single bond in the VlmO/ForJ product is oxidized by four electrons to yield the azoxy group. The catalytic cycle of VlmB appears to begin with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex in VlmB, as supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. This study also identifies N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;d&#8208;serine as an alternative substrate for VlmB leading to two azoxy regioisomers. The reactions catalyzed by the kinase VlmJ and the lyase VlmK during the final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis are established as well. The biosynthesis of valanimycin was thus fully reconstituted in vitro using the enzymes VlmO/ForJ, VlmB, VlmJ and VlmK.

     alt="Reconstitution of the Final Steps in the Biosynthesis of Valanimycin Reveals the Origin of Its Characteristic Azoxy Moiety"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis have been reconstituted in vitro. The oxidation of a dialkyl hydrazine intermediate to the characteristic azoxy moiety in valanimycin is catalyzed by VlmB, which is a non-heme diiron enzyme. The VlmB-catalyzed four-electron oxidation may commence with a resting &#956;-oxo diferric complex without prior reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valanimycin is an azoxy-containing natural product isolated from the fermentation broth of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces viridifaciens&lt;/i&gt; MG456-hF10. While the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been partially characterized, how the azoxy group is constructed remains obscure. Herein, the membrane protein VlmO and the putative hydrazine synthetase ForJ from the formycin biosynthetic pathway are demonstrated to catalyze N&#8722;N bond formation converting &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-seryl)-isobutyl hydroxylamine into &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(isobutylamino)-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine. Subsequent installation of the azoxy group is shown to be catalyzed by the non-heme diiron enzyme VlmB in a reaction in which the N&#8722;N single bond in the VlmO/ForJ product is oxidized by four electrons to yield the azoxy group. The catalytic cycle of VlmB appears to begin with a resting &#956;-oxo diferric complex in VlmB, as supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. This study also identifies &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(isobutylamino)-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine as an alternative substrate for VlmB leading to two azoxy regioisomers. The reactions catalyzed by the kinase VlmJ and the lyase VlmK during the final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis are established as well. The biosynthesis of valanimycin was thus fully reconstituted in vitro using the enzymes VlmO/ForJ, VlmB, VlmJ and VlmK. Importantly, the VlmB-catalyzed reaction represents the first example of enzyme-catalyzed azoxy formation and is expected to proceed by an atypical mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrapermeable Gel Membranes Enabling Superior Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel membranes integrate the structural benefits of solid and liquid phases, culminating in the plasticization of cross&#8208;linked structure. This results in a decrease in the density of chain segment stacking and enhances the free volume within the separation membrane. Consequently, these gel membranes exhibit exceptional gas permeability, setting new records in performance.







Abstract
Membrane technology is rapidly gaining broad attraction as a viable alternative for carbon capture to mitigate increasingly severe global warming. Emerging CO2&#8208;philic membranes have become crucial players in efficiently separating CO2 from light gases, leveraging their exceptional solubility&#8208;selectivity characteristics. However, economic and widespread deployment is greatly dependent on the boosted performance of advanced membrane materials for carbon capture. Here, we design a unique gel membrane composed of CO2&#8208;philic molecules for accelerating CO2 transportation over other gases for ultrapermeable carbon capture. The molecular design of such soft membranes amalgamates the advantageous traits of augmented permeation akin to liquid membranes and operational stability akin to solid membranes, effectively altering the membrane's free volume characteristics validated by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Surprisingly, gas diffusion through the free&#8208;volume&#8208;tuned gel membrane undergoes a 9&#8208;fold improvement without compromising the separation factor for the superior solubility selectivity of CO2&#8208;philic materials, and CO2 permeability achieves a groundbreaking record of 5608 Barrer surpassing the capabilities of nonfacilitated CO2 separation materials and exceeding the upper bound line established in 2019 even by leading&#8208;edge porous polymer materials. Our designed gel membrane can maintain exceptional separation performance during prolonged operation, enabling the unparalleled potential of solubility&#8208;selective next&#8208;generation materials towards sustainable carbon capture.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrizative Coupling of 7&#8208;Azabenzonorbornadienes with Alkynylanilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of prochiral 7&#8208;azabenzonorbornadienes with readily available alkynylanilines afforded dihydronaphthalenes via concomitant generation of three covalent bonds. The methods also allows to build two stereocenters and an indole motif in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective as well as atom&#8208;economic manner.







Abstract
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed, domino enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of 7&#8208;azabenzonorbornadienes with alkynylanilines is disclosed herein. This operationally simple transformation generates three covalent bonds and two contiguous stereocenters with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity. The resulting functionalized indole&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;amine conjugates served as an appealing platform to streamline the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) of other valuable enantioenriched compounds. DFT calculations revealed that the two stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions contributed to the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Facile Preparation of Carbohydrate&#8208;Containing Adjuvants Based on Self&#8208;Assembling Glycopeptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugates (GPCs) were synthesized to produce uniform nanoribbons with homogeneous oligosaccharides appended in a multivalent array. Some of the conjugates exhibited immunostimulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are intriguing biomolecules possessing diverse biological activities, including immune stimulating capability. However, their biomedical applications have been limited by their complex and heterogeneous structures. In this study, we have utilized a self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugate (GPC) system to produce uniform nanoribbons appending homogeneous oligosaccharides with multivalency. This system successfully translates the nontrivial structural differences of oligomannoses into varied binding affinities to C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs). We have shown that GPCs could promote the CLR&#8208;mediated endocytosis of ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, and two mannotriose&#8208;modified peptides F3m2 and F3m5 exhibit potent activity in inducing antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation, as indicated by increased CD86 and MHCII expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that GPCs, combined with OVA antigen, significantly enhanced OVA&#8208;specific antibody production. Specifically, F3m2 and F3m5 exhibited the highest immunostimulatory effects, eliciting both Th1&#8208; and Th2&#8208;biased immune responses and promoting differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+&#8197;T cells. These findings highlight the potential of GPCs as vaccine adjuvants, and showcase their versatility in exploiting the biological functions of carbohydrates.

         <title>Domino&#8208;Redox Reaction Induced by An Electrochemically Triggered Conformational Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally activated twisted&#8208;folded (T&#8208;F) form of bisquinodimethane with a dithiin skeleton (SS&#8208;BQD) undergoes a facile apparent 2e&#8208;transfer (trigger). Furthermore, in the resulting dication, the steric repulsion and interelectrophore interaction cause a facile and rapid change in the structure from the as&#8208;generated T2+&#8208;F form to the T2+&#8208;T form (domino), which facilitates the subsequent oxidation to the tetracation (domino).







Abstract
The concept of a domino&#8208;type reaction has been applied in a wide range of fields such as synthetic organic chemistry, material engineering, and life science. To extend the domino concept to redox chemistry, we designed and synthesized a dimeric quinodimethane (QD) with a nonplanar dithiin spacer. The domino&#8208;redox properties can be activated by raising the temperature, based on a thermally equilibrated twisted conformation of QD, which has a higher HOMO level that is more readily oxidized. After one QD unit is oxidized (trigger), steric repulsion and electronic interaction between electrophores make the neighboring QD unit adopt a twisted conformation (domino process), which facilitates the following oxidation. Thus, a domino&#8208;redox reaction was achieved for the first time by a change in the HOMO level due to a drastic change in the molecular conformation.

         <title>An Electrolyte with Less Space&#8208;Occupying Diluent at Cathode Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable 4.6 V Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reasonably elevating the working voltage (&#8805; 4.4 V vs. Li/Li+) of the cathode is one of the efficient approaches to maximize the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). As a preferred partner for high&#8208;voltage LIB systems, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE), characterized by a stronger Li solvation structure, less free solvent, and robust electrode/electrolyte interphase has attracted much attention in academic circles. Herein, we systematically studied the role of the diluent in LHCE on the formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and elucidated that the existing anion&#8208;diluent pairing in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) results in an uneven CEI and subsequent battery degradation under high voltage. A m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) diluent was further employed in the LHCE containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) to facilitate a uniform and rich&#8208;anion&#8208;derived CEI, since the weaker interaction of HmFT&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, as compared to the HHhydrofluoroether&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, reduces the influence of mFT in IHP or initial CEI formation. Consequently, the mFT&#8208;dominated LHCE propels the high&#8208;voltage performance of LIBs one step forward, endowing a 4.6 V&#8208;class 1.2&#8208;Ah graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells a 90.4% capacity retention after 130 cycles. Our study thus describes a new index affecting the CEI formation and proposes novel strategies to deeply optimize the high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (UHMW) polymers with tailored structures are highly desirable for the outstanding properties. In this work, we developed a novel photoorganocatalyzed controlled radical alternating copolymerizations of fluoroalkyl maleimide and diverse vinyl comonomers, enabling efficient preparation of fluorinated copolymers of predetermined UHMWs and well&#8208;defined structures at high conversions. Versatility of this method was demonstrated by expanding to controlled terpolymerization, which allows facial access toward fluorinated terpolymers of UHMWs and functional pendants. The obtained copolymers exhibited attractive physical properties and furnished thermoplastic, anticorrosive and (super)hydrophobic attributes as coatings on different substrates. Molecular simulations provided insights into the coating morphology, which unveiled a fluorous protective layer on the top surface with polar groups attached to the bottom substrate, resulting in good adhesion and hydrophobicity, simultaneously. This synthetic method and customized copolymers shed light on the design of high&#8208;performance coatings by macromolecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na&#8208;ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn&#8208;based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N&#8208;coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08 was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low&#8208;entropy and conventional single&#8208;metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high&#8208;symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high&#8208;entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of&#160;phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Phosphor with High Efficiency and Long Lifetime in Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) Through Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Triplet Exciton Formation for Photolithography Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) strategy, a new ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor dyad OF&#8208;BCz showing a long lifetime (&#964;P) of 1.92&#8197;s and a high efficiency (&#934;P) up to 30&#8201;% in PMMA matrix, was constructed. Thanks to its excellent performance and high triplet energy level (ET1), OF&#8208;BCz was successfully applied in photolithography as a photoinitiator and an in situ quality indicator.







Abstract
Currently, purely organic compounds showing ambient phosphorescence with high efficiency (&#934;P) and ultra&#8208;long lifetime (&#964;P) are quite rare and often need to be achieved in hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based hosts. This severely limits their applications. Here, we provide a solution to this issue by constructing an ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) dyad whose D moiety has not only a long&#8208;lived T1 state to achieve a long &#964;P, but also a Tn state that is close to the S1 state of the dyad to trigger effective spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The rationality of this strategy was validated by a new phosphor OF&#8208;BCz that is able to show a &#964;P of 1.92&#8197;s and a &#934;P of 30&#8201;% even in a less rigid matrix of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Excitingly, OF&#8208;BCz exhibited its potential as both a photocuring initiator and an in situ quality indicator, allowing for the visual detection of defects in photolithographic patterning.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation of Ketones with 2&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric allylation of ketones under proton&#8208;transfer conditions is a challenging issue due to the limited pronucleophiles and the electrophilic inertness of ketones. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines work as synthetic equivalents of propanals. Upon the acidic workup, a formal asymmetric &#946;&#8208;addition of propanals to ketones is achieved. An investigation on KIE effect indicates that the deprotonation of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines is the rate&#8208;determining step, which generates nucleophilic allyl copper(I) species. Finally, the synthetic utility of the present method is demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;boivinianin A and (R)&#8208;gossonorol.

         <title>Rapid Formation of Non&#8208;canonical Phospholipid Membranes by Chemoselective Amide&#8208;Forming Ligations with Hydroxylamines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal de novo phospholipid synthesis utilizing the reactions between hydroxylamine and &#945;&#8208;ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) enables the rapid formation of biomimetic membranes under physiological pH conditions, using reactant concentrations in the micromolar range. Additionally, these reactions are biocompatible and can be performed in living mammalian cells.







Abstract
There has been increasing interest in methods to generate synthetic lipid membranes as key constituents of artificial cells or to develop new tools for remodeling membranes in living cells. However, the biosynthesis of phospholipids involves elaborate enzymatic pathways that are challenging to reconstitute in vitro. An alternative approach is to use chemical reactions to non&#8208;enzymatically generate natural or non&#8208;canonical phospholipids de novo. Previous reports have shown that synthetic lipid membranes can be formed in situ using various ligation chemistries, but these methods lack biocompatibility and/or suffer from slow kinetics at physiological pH.

&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal de novo phospholipid synthesis utilizing the reactions between hydroxylamine and &#945;-ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) enables the rapid formation of biomimetic membranes under physiological pH conditions, using reactant concentrations in the micromolar range. Additionally, these reactions are biocompatible and can be performed in living mammalian cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing interest in methods to generate synthetic lipid membranes as key constituents of artificial cells or to develop new tools for remodeling membranes in living cells. However, the biosynthesis of phospholipids involves elaborate enzymatic pathways that are challenging to reconstitute in vitro. An alternative approach is to use chemical reactions to non-enzymatically generate natural or non-canonical phospholipids de novo. Previous reports have shown that synthetic lipid membranes can be formed in situ using various ligation chemistries, but these methods lack biocompatibility and/or suffer from slow kinetics at physiological pH. Thus, it would be valuable to develop chemoselective strategies for synthesizing phospholipids from water-soluble precursors that are compatible with synthetic or living cells Here, we demonstrate that amide-forming ligations between lipid precursors bearing hydroxylamines and &#945;-ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) can be used to prepare non-canonical phospholipids at physiological pH conditions. The generated amide-linked phospholipids spontaneously self-assemble into cell-like micron-sized vesicles similar to natural phospholipid membranes. We show that lipid synthesis using KAT ligation proceeds extremely rapidly, and the high selectivity and biocompatibility of the approach facilitates the in situ synthesis of phospholipids and associated membranes in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Indoles via Carbene Catalyzed Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles are widely found in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole&#8208;based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3&#8208;carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles with a variety of ring sizes (10&#8208;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole&#8208;based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.</dc:description>

We developed an indirect methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Kdo glycosides with a C3&#8208;p&#8208;tolylthio&#8208;substituted Kdo phosphite donor. The presence of the p&#8208;tolylthio group enhanced the reactivity, suppressed the formation of elimination by&#8208;products (2,3&#8208;enes), and provided complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol. A variety of Kdo &#945;&#8208;glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98%). After glycosylation, p&#8208;tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by the free radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route for the challenging 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPS from several A. baumannii strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8&#8208;branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Based Nanoflow Cytometry Method for the Molecular Detection and Classification of Ovarian Cancers through Profiling of Tumor Markers on Small Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular profiling of protein markers on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) is a promising strategy for the precise detection and classification of ovarian cancers. However, this strategy is challenging owing to the lack of simple and practical detection methods. In this work, using an aptamer&#8208;based nanoflow cytometry (nFCM) detection strategy, a simple and rapid method for the molecular profiling of multiple protein markers on sEVs was developed. The protein markers can be easily labeled with aptamer probes and then rapidly profiled by nFCM. Seven cancer&#8208;associated protein markers, including&#160;CA125, STIP1, CD24, EpCAM, EGFR, MUC1, and HER2, on plasma sEVs were profiled for the molecular detection and classification of ovarian cancers. Profiling these seven protein markers enabled the precise detection of ovarian cancer with a high accuracy of 94.2%. In addition, combined with machine learning algorithms, such&#160;as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), the molecular classifications of ovarian cancer cell lines and subtypes were achieved with overall accuracies of 82.9% and 55.4%, respectively. Therefore, this simple, rapid, and non&#8208;invasive method exhibited&#160;considerable potential for the auxiliary diagnosis and molecular classification of ovarian cancers in clinical practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent Generations and Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Cations from Alkynes
</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and their divergent further transformations have been established. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized. The intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage was supported by DFT calculations in both catalytic systems.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Carbonyl cations are the umpolung forms of the synthetically fundamental &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbanions. They are highly reactive yet rarely studied and utilized species and their precursors were rather limited. Herein, we report the catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and the interception of them via Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. Two chemodivergent catalytic systems have been established, leading to two different types of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations and, eventually, two different types of products, i.e. the &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized and the migration priorities of different groups in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement step was elucidated. Density functional theory calculations further supported the intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage in both the two catalytic systems. Another key feature of this methodology was the fragmentation of synthetically inert tert&#8208;butyl groups into readily transformable olefin functionalities. The synthetic potential was highlighted by the scale&#8208;up reactions and the downstream diversifications including the formal synthesis of nicotlactone B and galbacin.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitchable Benzimidazole Azo&#8208;Arenes as &#946;&#8208;Arrestin2&#8208;Biased Selective Cannabinoid 2 Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable scaffold was developed based on the &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; of benzimidazole: 2&#8208;benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes. This scaffold was used for the development of functionally selective cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) ligands with &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) bias. Compound 10&#8201;d acts as a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;efficacy switch in &#946;arr2&#8208;mediated endocytosis and can be used to investigate the CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 endocytic pathway.







Abstract
The cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) has high therapeutic potential for multiple pathogenic processes, such as neuroinflammation. Pathway&#8208;selective ligands are needed to overcome the lack of clinical success and to elucidate correlations between pathways and their respective therapeutic effects.

&lt;p&gt;A new photoswitchable scaffold was developed based on the &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; of benzimidazole: 2-benzimidazole azo-arenes. This scaffold was used for the development of functionally selective cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) ligands with &#946;-arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) bias. Compound &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; acts as a &#8220;&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-on&#8221;-efficacy switch in &#946;arr2-mediated endocytosis and can be used to investigate the CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-&#946;arr2 endocytic pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) has high therapeutic potential for multiple pathogenic processes, such as neuroinflammation. Pathway-selective ligands are needed to overcome the lack of clinical success and to elucidate correlations between pathways and their respective therapeutic effects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a photoswitchable scaffold based on the privileged structure of benzimidazole and its application as a functionally selective CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R &#8220;efficacy-switch&#8221;. Benzimidazole azo-arenes offer huge potential for the broad extension of photopharmacology to a wide range of optically addressable biological targets. We used this scaffold to develop compound &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, a &#8220;&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-on&#8221; agonist, which serves as a molecular probe to study the &#946;-arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) pathway at CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R. &#946;&#913;rr2 bias was observed in CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R internalization and &#946;arr2 recruitment, while no activation occurred when looking at G&#945;&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; or mini-G&#945;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Streamlined Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Loop Mimicry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Matching (BM) evaluates virtual libraries of cyclic peptidomimetics containing an organic fragment, for interface loop mimicry in protein&#8208;protein interactions. It does so by comparing their backbone conformers with interface loops on the protein ligand. Hits for iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2 and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR were validated experimentally.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides comprising endocyclic organic fragments, &#8220;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides&#8221;, can be probes for perturbing protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Finding loop mimics is difficult because of high conformational variability amongst targets. Backbone Matching (BM), introduced here, helps solve this problem in the illustrative cases by facilitating efficient evaluation of virtual cyclo&#8208;organopeptide core&#8208;structure libraries. Thus, 86 rigid organic fragments were selected to build a library of 602 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides comprising Ala and organic parts: &#8220;cyclo&#8208;{&#8208;(Ala)n&#8208;organo&#8208;}&#8221;. The central hypothesis is &#8220;hit&#8221; library members have accessible low energy conformers corresponding to backbone structures of target protein loops, while library members which cannot attain this conformation are probably unworthy of further evaluation. BM thereby prioritizes candidate loop mimics, so that less than 10&#8197;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides are needed to be prepared to find leads for two illustrative PPIs: iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2, and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR.

         <title>Organocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enabled Asymmetric Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Chiral Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed for building two types of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes via the phosphonium salt catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael reaction together with copper salt enabled aromatization. The scalability and practicality of this protocol were validated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and transformation of products, particularly towards producing novel helical phosphine ligands that were successfully utilized in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Selenide&#8208;containing Materials Based on Transalkylation of Selenonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation between selenonium salts and selenides can be easily achieved by adding alkylation reagents to the selenide compounds. By incorporating selenonium salts into polyurethane networks, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as solvent and creep resistance at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess unique properties as a result of their internal dynamic bonds, such as self&#8208;healing and reprocessing abilities. In this study, we report a thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation exchange between selenonium salts and selenides, which undergo a fast transalkylation reaction in the absence of any catalyst. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a dissociative mechanism in the absence of selenide groups. After incorporation of this DCC into selenide&#8208;containing polymer materials, it was observed that the cross&#8208;linked networks display varying dynamic exchange rates when using different alkylation reagents, suggesting that the reprocessing capacity of selenide&#8208;containing materials can be regulated. Also, by incorporating selenonium salts into polymer materials, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as excellent solvent resistance at ambient temperature. This novel dynamic covalent chemistry thus provides a straightforward method for the healing and reprocessing of selenide&#8208;containing materials.

         <title>Supracluster Assembly of Archimedean Cages with 72 Hydrogen Bonds for the Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>

Al&#8722;O clusters&#8208;based supraclusters presenting multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonded porous assemblies can offer outstanding catalysis ability both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases. The supracluster proposed here will build a bridge between &#8220;supramolecule&#8221; and &#8220;supraparticle&#8221;, and provide new perspectives for synthesizing zeolite&#8208;like materials.







Abstract
Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites. By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite&#8208;like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72&#8208;fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H&#8208;tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H&#8208;tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H&#8208;tcu into edge&#8208;directed and vertex&#8208;directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale&#8208;up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.

By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} cluster compounds possessing brucite-like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} clusters form 72-fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; supracluster cage (abbreviated as &lt;b&gt;H-&lt;i&gt;tcu&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the &lt;b&gt;H-&lt;i&gt;tcu&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of &lt;b&gt;H&lt;i&gt;-tcu&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; into edge-directed and vertex-directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale-up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8722;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O solution, structural and chemical properties of supported metal oxide species can be controlled because of dissolution&#8208;recrystallization of amorphous or/and low&#8208;crystalline support in the parent catalyst. The method is applicable for tailoring the catalyst reducibility and thus its activity for C&#8722;H activation in hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8722;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing the pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8722;ZrO2&#8722;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayer was constructed on Pd nanoparticles in air at only 400&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting catalyst with non&#8208;metal active sites exhibited an exceptional resistance to poisoning by SO2 and H2O, yielding robust CO oxidation performance under 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O at temperatures as low as 120&#8201;&#176;C for at least 240&#8197;h.







Abstract
The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21&#8197;vol&#8201;% O2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8208;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 240&#8197;h (at 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8722;S) bonding.

         <title>Toward De Novo Catalyst Discovery: Fast Identification of New Catalyst Candidates for Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reactions

A method to discover new catalysts: We grow a reaction network for each catalyst template (Ci) and look for catalytic activity in each reaction network. The reactant (R) reacts with the catalyst template (Ci) and forms several intermediates (Ii) before reaching a product (P) with the catalyst template regenerated.







Abstract
Recently we have demonstrated how a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from random tertiary amines can be used to discover a new and efficient catalyst for the alcohol&#8208;mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction. In particular, the discovered catalyst was shown experimentally to be eight times more active than DABCO, commonly used to catalyze the MBH reaction. This represents a breakthrough in using generative models for catalyst optimization. However, the GA procedure, and hence discovery, relied on two important pieces of information; 1)&#8197;the knowledge that tertiary amines catalyze the reaction and 2)&#8197;the mechanism and reaction profile for the catalyzed reaction, in particular the transition state structure of the rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, truly de novo catalyst discovery must include these steps. Here we present such a method for discovering catalyst candidates for a specific reaction while simultaneously proposing a mechanism for the catalyzed reaction. We show that tertiary amines and phosphines are potential catalysts for the MBH reaction by screening 11 molecular templates representing common functional groups. The method relies on an automated reaction discovery workflow using meta&#8208;dynamics calculations. Combining this method for catalyst candidate discovery with our GA&#8208;based catalyst optimization method results in an algorithm for truly de novo catalyst discovery.

         <title>Aryne&#8208;Enabled C&#8722;N Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N arylation of easily accessible tertiary anilines enabled by bifunctional arynes is described. The reaction proceeds via a tandem nucleophilic attack of anilines to arynes, followed by a Smiles&#8208;Truce rearrangement to furnish synthetically valuable and densely substituted biaryls. This protocol was further utilized for heterocyclic scaffolds, providing access to medium size azaheterocycles via n+2 carbon insertion.







Abstract
Anilines are potentially high&#8208;value arylating agents, but are limited by the low reactivity of the strong C&#8722;N bond. We show that the reactive intermediate benzyne can be used to both activate anilines, and set&#8208;up an aryl transfer reaction in a single step. The reaction does not require any transition metal catalysts or stoichiometric organometallics, and establishes a metal&#8208;free route to valuable biaryl products by functionalizing the aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Silver and Copper Nitride Cooperate for CO Electroreduction to Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8208;doped copper nitride is a highly selective electrocatalyst for CO reduction to n&#8208;propanol leading to a record Faradaic Efficiency value of 45&#8201;% at an industrially&#8208;relevant current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, in an alkaline flow electrolyser.







Abstract
The need of carbon sources for the chemical industry, alternative to fossil sources, has pointed to CO2 as a possible feedstock. While CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) allows production of interesting organic compounds, it suffers from large carbon losses, mainly due to carbonate formation. This is why, quite recently, tandem CO2R, a two&#8208;step process, with first CO2R to CO using a solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction (COR), has been considered, since no carbon is lost as carbonate in either step. Here we report a novel copper&#8208;based catalyst, silver&#8208;doped copper nitride, with record selectivity for formation of propanol (Faradaic efficiency: 45&#8201;%), an industrially relevant compound, from CO electroreduction in gas&#8208;fed flow cells. Selective propanol formation occurs at metallic copper atoms derived from copper nitride and is promoted by silver doping as shown experimentally and computationally. In addition, the selectivity for C2+ liquid products (Faradaic efficiency: 80&#8201;%) is among the highest reported so far. These findings open new perspectives regarding the design of catalysts for production of C3 compounds from CO2.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Aryl Shift and Double Alkyne Benzannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
If the occupied position on the heterocyclic core is exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, alkyne benzannulation occurs at this position with concomitant 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. The resulting slightly curved N&#8208;doped nanographenes possess an unprecedented combination of six fused aromatic rings and strong emission of yellow light.







Abstract
The tandem intramolecular hydroarylation of alkynes accompanied by a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is described. Harnessing the unique electron&#8208;rich character of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole scaffold, we demonstrate that the hydroarylation of alkynes proceeds at the already occupied positions&#8197;2 and 5 leading to a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds only in the presence of cationic gold catalyst, and it leads to heretofore unknown &#960;&#8208;expanded, centrosymmetric pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles. The utility is verified in the preparation of 13&#8197;products that bear six conjugated rings. The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the formation of the six&#8208;membered rings accompanied with a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is both kinetically and thermodynamically favourable over plausible formation of products containing 7&#8208;membered rings. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties are rationalized through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.

         <title>Dithienoazepine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes: Janus&#8208;Faced Effects of a Thiophene&#8208;Fused Structure on Antiaromatic Azepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine was employed as a key core of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The Janus&#8208;faced effect of the thiophene&#8208;fused structure, which enhances the antiaromaticity of the azepine ring and, at the same time, relieves the antiaromaticity through the deformation from the aromatic thiophene ring to the quinoidal thienyl moiety, is effective to attain the largely red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878&#8197;nm in solution.

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

Hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene, an organic electrode material with synergetic coupling effects of abundant redox&#8208;active sites and stable conjugated cores, via nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, delivers excellent rate capability, and robust cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs), valued for their sustainability and structural tunability, have been attracting increasing attention for wide application in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and other rechargeable batteries. However, most OEMs are plagued with insufficient specific capacity or poor cycling stability. Therefore, it&#8242;s imperative to enhance their specific capacity and cycling stability through molecular design. Herein, we designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) by the synergetic coupling of catechol (the precursor of ortho&#8208;quinone)/ortho&#8208;quinone functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. The abundance of catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone and imine redox&#8208;active moieties delivers a high specific capacity of nine&#8208;electron transfer for SIBs. Most notably, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules secure the stable long&#8208;term cycling performance of SIBs. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (554&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73&#8201;% after 3000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in SIBs. Additionally, the nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism is confirmed by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculation, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), and Raman analysis. The achievement of the synergetic coupling of the redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs could be an important key to the enhancement of SIBs and other metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrocatalytic 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation of alkenes utilizing readily available materials in ambient conditions is developed. The protocol is widely applicable to aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with excellent faradaic efficiencies and yields of up to 96&#8201;%. The versatility of the method is expanded with alkenoic acids towards lactone derivatives and with other carboxylic acids like HCOOH.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87&#8201;%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Reaction Chemistry at Discrete Organometallic Fragments on Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular functionalization techniques are leveraged to anchor well&#8208;defined organometallic fragments on the surface of black phosphorus. The functionalized nanosheets feature a high density of metal sites, with discrete and robust M&#8722;P bonds that are stable to subsequent transformations. The Tolman electronic parameter and steric bulk of bP are also estimated relative to molecular phosphines.







Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) is a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals material unique in its potential to serve as a support for single&#8208;site catalysts due to its similarity to molecular phosphines, ligands quintessential in homogeneous catalysis. However, there is a scarcity of synthetic methods to install single metal centers on the bP lattice. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of bP nanosheets with molecular Re and Mo complexes. A suite of characterization techniques, including infrared, X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy corroborate that the functionalized nanosheets contain a high density of discrete metal centers directly bound to the bP surface. Moreover, the supported metal centers are chemically accessible and can undergo ligand exchange transformations without detaching from the surface. The steric and electronic properties of bP as a ligand are estimated with respect to molecular phosphines. Sterically, bP resembles tri(tolyl)phosphine when monodentate to a metal center, and bis(diphenylphosphino)propane when bidentate, whereas electronically bP is a &#963;&#8208;donor as strong as a trialkyl phosphine. This work is foundational in elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand and underscores the viability of using bP as a basis for single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Polymer Multi&#8208;Block and Multi&#8208;Block+ Strategies for the Upcycling of Mixed Polyolefins and Other Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multi&#8208;block copolymers with tunable microstructures were prepared and used as compatibilizer additives for upcycling mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was demonstrated to enable block extension during in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties and 3D printing capability.







Abstract
Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end&#8208;of&#8208;life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi&#8208;block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as compatibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi&#8208;block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi&#8208;block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.

         <title>An Extended NIR&#8208;II Superior Imaging Window from 1500 to 1900&#8197;nm for High&#8208;Resolution In Vivo Multiplexed Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of novel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles in the whole near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) beyond 1700&#8197;nm. Inspired by the scattering and water absorption, we then defined the NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8197;nm&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window for high&#8208;resolution multiplexed imaging of lymph, blood vessels and intestines.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio&#8208;tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR&#8208;IIb (1500&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window can provide high&#8208;resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging. However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR&#8208;IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging. To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the conventional NIR&#8208;IIb window to NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window on the basis of photon&#8208;scattering and water&#8208;absorption. We developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852&#8197;nm to 2842&#8197;nm. NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L nanoprobes enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging on blood vessels and intestines, and provided multi&#8208;channels imaging on lymph tubes, tumors and intestines. The proposed NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L probes without mutual interference are powerful tools for high&#8208;contrast in vivo multiplexed detection, which holds promise for revealing physiological process in living body.

         <title>Constructing Intrapenetrated Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Protozeolite Seeding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystalline intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolite with highly complete framework was synthesized via protozeolite seeding. The protozeolite provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared zeolite presented excellent performance in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction.







Abstract
Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite&#8208;seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization.

     alt="Constructing Intrapenetrated Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Protozeolite Seeding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single-crystalline intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolite with highly complete framework was synthesized via protozeolite seeding. The protozeolite provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as-prepared zeolite presented excellent performance in the methanol-to-propylene reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite-seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single-crystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization. The protozeolite nanoseeds provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as-prepared hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited ultra-long lifetime of 443.9&#8197;hours and a high propylene selectivity of 47.92&#8201;% at a WHSV of 2&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the methanol-to-propylene reaction. This work provides a facile protozeolite-seeded strategy for the synthesis of intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolites that are highly effective for catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>

High&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via matching S cathodes in aqueous Cu2+ ion&#8208;based electrolyte and Li anodes in organic electrolyte. The Li||S hybrid batteries deliver a high discharge voltage and satisfactory capacity, contributing to incredible energy density.







Abstract
Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4&#8197;V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>

         <dc:description>
Supramolecular interactions in the solid state (X&#8208;ray) and solution (mixtures of THF/H2O) control the photophysical properties! A singular 3D nanographene (Tetrahedraphene) shows a remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon water addition changing from blue in solution to vivid yellow colour in the precipitated solid. TDDFT calculations predict the formation of efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in solution, thus supporting the photophysical findings.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.

         <title>Hierarchical Fluid Interface Enables Spatiotemporal Regulation of Ligand Distribution to Increase Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Interfacial Binding Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) based on aptamer&#8208;functionalized Au nanoparticles (&#8220;islands&#8221;) and fluid fluorescent aptamer ligands (&#8220;rafts&#8221;) was engineered on a microfluidic chip surface. HieFluidFace allowed to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions via spatiotemporal regulation of ligand distribution, and was used for efficient capture and direct identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples.







Abstract
In nature, regulation of the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial receptors and ligands leads to optimum binding kinetics and thermodynamics of receptor&#8211;ligand binding reactions within interfaces. Inspired by this, we report a hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) to regulate the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial ligands to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions. Each aptamer&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticle, termed spherical aptamer (SAPT), is anchored on a supported lipid bilayer without fluidity, like an &#8220;island&#8221;, and is surrounded by many fluorescent aptamers (FAPTs) with free fluidity, like &#8220;rafts&#8221;. Such ligand &#8220;island&#8208;rafts&#8221; model provides a large reactive cross&#8208;section for rapid binding to cellular receptors. The synergistic multivalency of SAPTs and FAPTs improves interfacial affinity for tight capture. Moreover, FAPTs accumulate at binding sites to bind to cellular receptors with clustered fluorescence to &#8220;lighten&#8221; cells for direct identification. Thus, HieFluidFace in a microfluidic chip achieves high&#8208;performance capture and identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples, providing a new paradigm to optimize the kinetics and thermodynamics of interfacial binding reactions.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomedicine was designed to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) against glioma (GBM). Upon intravenous injection, the nanomedicine penetrated the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulated within the TME of GBM&#8208;bearing mice, which subsequently abolished the negative feedback regulation function of SOCS1 on dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, elicited strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibited tumor growth.







Abstract
Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved the outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrated that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) was associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and developed a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silenced SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggered strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was loaded with a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a peptide, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. The nanomedicine concentrated on the TME in vivo, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate the TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved the outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrated that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) was associated with the GBM-associated immunosuppression and developed a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silenced SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggered strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was loaded with a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a peptide, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. The nanomedicine concentrated on the TME in vivo, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate the TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Flexible Dielectric Films from Solution Processable Covalent Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymers, like covalent organic frameworks, are promising materials for a wide variety of applications. However, unlike conventional polymers, they are challenging to mold, shape, or process. Here we show how insoluble COFs, functionalized with oligoether sidechains, can be solution cast into high&#8208;dielectric films, with excellent flexibility and mechanical strength.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are known to be a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications, yet their poor solution processability limits their utility in many areas. Here we report a pore engineering method using hydrophilic side chains to improve the processability of hydrazone and &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs and the production of flexible, crystalline films. Mechanical measurements of the free&#8208;standing COF films of COF&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (hydrazone&#8208;linked) and TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked), revealed a Young's modulus of 391.7&#8197;MPa and 1034.7&#8197;MPa, respectively. The solubility and excellent mechanical properties enabled the use of these COFs in dielectric devices. Specifically, the TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 film&#8208;based dielectric capacitors display simultaneously high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, resulting in a discharged energy density of 11.22&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work offers a general approach for producing solution processable COFs and mechanically flexible COF&#8208;based films, which hold great potential for use in energy storage and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoclusters with reversible pH responsiveness have been developed by the incorporation of tertiary amine groups in the surface ligands. The amine groups change the highest occupied molecular orbital upon their pH&#8208;induced protonation and deprotonation, resulting in photoluminescence quenching.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with pH&#8208;responsive properties suggest merits in biological analyses. This work establishes a general and effective method to obtain pH&#8208;responsive NIR emissive gold nanoclusters by introducing aliphatic tertiary amine (TA) groups into the ligands. Computational study suggests that the pH&#8208;responsive NIR emission is associated with electronic structure change upon protonation and deprotonation of TA groups. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au&#8208;S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8211;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8211;7). The pH&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non&#8208;invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.

         <title>Chiral Auxiliary Approach for Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes and alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with chiral auxiliaries has been developed, affording, after hydrolysis, synthetically challenging enantioenriched ketones. This chiral auxiliary approach is an alternative to the use of complex chiral catalysts in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclizations.







Abstract
Two different classes of stereoselective cyclizations have been developed using a chiral auxiliary approach with commercially available [JohnPhosAu(MeCN)SbF6] as catalyst. First, a stereoselective cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes was achieved using the Oppolzer camphorsultam as chiral auxiliary. In this case, a one&#8208;pot cyclization&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was developed to directly afford enantioenriched spirocyclic ketones. Then, the stereoselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes was mediated by an Evans&#8208;type oxazolidinone. A reduction&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was selected to remove the auxiliary to give enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tetralones. DFT studies confirmed that the steric clash between the chiral auxiliary and alkene accounts for the experimentally observed diastereoselective cyclization through the Si face.

         <title>UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Harvesting Conjugated Porous Polymer Nanocomposite: Upconversion and Plasmon Expedited Thioether Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;functionalized upconversion nanoparticles are covalently linked to conjugated porous organic polymers, followed by the loading of gold nanoparticles to form a UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorbing photocatalyst, UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The synergistic influence of plasmon absorption and upconversion luminescence improves photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including the detoxification of chemical warfare agents under natural sunlight and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysts capable of harvesting a broad range of the solar spectrum are essential for sustainable chemical transformations and environmental remediation. Herein, we have integrated NIR&#8208;absorbing upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) with UV&#8208;Vis absorbing conjugated porous organic polymer (POP) through the in situ multicomponent C&#8722;C coupling to fabricate a UC&#8722;POP nanocomposite. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of UC&#8722;POP is further augmented by loading plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNP) into UC&#8722;POP. A three&#8208;times enhancement in the upconversion luminescence is observed upon the incorporation of AuNP in UC&#8722;POP, subsequently boosting the photocatalytic activity of UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical investigations infer the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including mustard gas simulant by UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au compared to POP and UC&#8722;POP due to the facile electron&#8208;hole pair generation, suppressed exciton recombination, and efficient charge carrier migration. Thus, the unique design strategy of combining plasmonic and upconversion nanoparticles with a conjugated porous organic polymer opens up new vistas towards artificial light harvesting.

         <title>Green Ether Electrolytes for Sustainable High&#8208;voltage Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green ether solvent is reported through a rational design of carbon chain regulation that tunes steric hindrance for an efficient solvation structure. Such a structure significantly reduces the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity, and the tuned solvation structure results in sustainable high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs.

&lt;p&gt;A green ether solvent is reported through a rational design of carbon chain regulation that tunes steric hindrance for an efficient solvation structure. Such a structure significantly reduces the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity, and the tuned solvation structure results in sustainable high-voltage electrolytes for alkali metal-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ether-based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon-chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion-dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium-ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether-based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2&#8197;V high-voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64&#8201;%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether-based electrolytes for practical high-voltage potassium-ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Six&#8208;Electron&#8208;Redox Iodine Electrodes for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Batteries</title>

Six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in aqueous electrolytes. The unique energy storage mechanism leads to high capacity and potential of I2 electrodes, contributing to enhanced energy density of corresponding aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Iodine (I2) shows great promising as the active material in aqueous batteries due to its distinctive merits of high abundance in ocean and low cost. However, in conventional aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries, the energy storage mechanism of I&#8722;/I2 conversion is only two&#8208;electron redox reaction, limiting their energy density. Herein, six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in electrolytes. The redox&#8208;active Cu2+ ions in electrolytes induce the conversion between Cu2+ ions and I2 to CuI at low potential. Simultaneously, the Cl&#8722; ions in electrolytes activate the I2/ICl redox couple at high potential. As a result, in our case, I2&#8208;based battery system with six&#8208;electron redox is developed. Such energy storage mechanism with six&#8208;electron redox leads to high discharge potential and capacity, excellent rate capability, as well as stable cycling behavior of I2 electrodes. Impressively, six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox I2 cathodes can match various aqueous metal (e.g. Zn, Mn and Fe) anodes to construct metal||I2 hybrid batteries. These hybrid batteries not only deliver enhanced capacities, but also exhibit higher operate voltages, which contributes to superior energy densities. Therefore, this work broadens the horizon for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Optimized Crystal Framework by Asymmetric Core Isomerization in Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the regional selenium isomerization and asymmetric crystal engineering are applied to synthesize isomeric small molecular acceptors. Benefiting from optimized crystal packing, favourable morphology and ordered molecular arrangement, A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based binary organic solar cells yield a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% and low energy loss among selenium&#8208;containing acceptors.







Abstract
Both the regional isomerization and selenium&#8208;substitution of the small molecular acceptors (SMAs) play significant roles in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), while their synergistic effects remain elusive. Herein, we developed three isomeric SMAs (S&#8208;CSeF, A&#8208;ISeF, and A&#8208;OSeF) via subtly manipulating the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position (central, inner, or outer) and type of heteroaromatic ring on the central core by synergistic strategies for efficient OSCs, respectively. Crystallography of asymmetric A&#8208;OSeF presents a closer intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and more ordered 3&#8208;dimensional network packing and efficient charge&#8208;hopping pathways. With the successive out&#8208;shift of the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position, the neat films give a slightly wider band gap and gradually higher crystallinity and electron mobility. The PM1&#8201;:&#8201;A&#8208;OSeF afford favourable fibrous phase separation morphology with more ordered molecular packing and efficient charge transportation compared to the other two counterparts. Consequently, the A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based devices achieve a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;%, which represents the record value for the reported selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our developed precise molecular engineering of the position and type of selenium&#8208;based heteroaromatic ring of SMAs provides a promising synergistic approach to optimizing crystal stacking and boosting top&#8208;ranked selenium&#8208;containing SMAs&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Photosynthesis of Benzonitriles on BiOBr Nanosheets Promoted by Vacancy Associates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiOBr photocatalysts with different surface vacancy associates were successfully synthesized. Vacancy associates of Br&#8722;Bi&#8722;Br triple atom vacancy (VBrBiBr) and oxygen vacancies can generate benzonitrile with high selectivity in the photocatalytic ammoxidation of benzyl alcohol by providing adsorption activation sites for NH3 and O2 and reaction sites for the multi&#8208;step formation of imine intermediates and oxidation to benzonitrile.







Abstract
Photocatalytic organic functionalization reactions represent a green, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable synthesis route for value&#8208;added chemicals. However, heterogeneous photocatalysis is inefficient in directly activating ammonia molecules for the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrogenous organic products when compared with oxygen activation in the formation of related oxygenated compounds. In this study, we report the heterogeneous photosynthesis of benzonitriles by the ammoxidation of benzyl alcohols (99&#8201;% conversion, 93&#8201;% selectivity) promoted using BiOBr nanosheets with surface vacancy associates. In contrast, the main reaction of catalysts with other types of vacancy sites is the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde or benzoic acid. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations have demonstrated a specificity of vacancy type with respect to product selectivity, which arises from the adsorption and activation of NH3 and O2 that is required to promote subsequent C&#8722;N coupling and oxidation to nitrile. This study provides a better understanding of the role of vacancies as catalytic sites in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4 and H2O2 under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalyst achieves high electronic selectivity for CH4 and facile separation of H2O2 in non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions with only CO2 and H2O. This exceptional performance is attributed to a long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited electron acceptor, promoting the formation of a stabilized five&#8208;member&#8208;ring cyclic intermediate with lower energy, leading to an 90&#8201;% selectivity for the eight&#8208;electron product CH4.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH4 from by&#8208;product O2 has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst of a novel electron&#8208;acceptor 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal&#8208;free catalyst achieves non&#8208;sacrificial photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 and easily separable H2O2. This photocatalyst offers CH4 product of 10.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi&#8208;step reaction mechanism, in which the long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO2 activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH4 product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90&#8201;%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to easily separable CH4 in non&#8208;sacrificial and metal&#8208;free conditions.

&lt;p&gt;A metal-free photocatalyst achieves high electronic selectivity for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and facile separation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in non-sacrificial ambient conditions with only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This exceptional performance is attributed to a long-lived oxygen-centered radical in the excited electron acceptor, promoting the formation of a stabilized five-member-ring cyclic intermediate with lower energy, leading to an 90&#8201;% selectivity for the eight-electron product CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal-based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from by-product O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal-free photocatalyst of a novel electron-acceptor 4,5,9,10-pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal-free catalyst achieves non-sacrificial photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and easily separable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This photocatalyst offers CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; product of 10.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under non-sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal-free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi-step reaction mechanism, in which the long-lived oxygen-centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90&#8201;%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to easily separable CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in non-sacrificial and metal-free conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Local CO2 Adsorption by L&#8208;histidine Incorporation for Selective Formate Production Over the Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach towards enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of Bi&#8208;based catalysts was demonstrated via the L&#8208;histidine incorporation. The improved CO2 chemical adsorption and electron&#8208;rich nature of resultant catalysts enables high Faradaic efficiency for formate production in an ultra&#8208;wide potential window even with low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding. (TETA and DEA refer to triethylenetetramine and diethanolamine, respectively).







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals is a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues. However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth&#8208;based (BH) catalysts with L&#8208;histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade&#8208;off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron&#8208;rich nature by L&#8208;histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&gt;90&#8201;% within &#8722;0.1&#8211;&#8722;1.8&#8197;V and &gt;95&#8201;% within &#8722;0.2&#8211;&#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20&#8197;vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of &#8722;0.05&#8197;VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of &#8722;0.02&#8197;VRHE) was detected by in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements, together with stable operation over 50&#8197;h with preserved FEformate of &#8776;95&#8201;% and high partial current density of 326.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE.

         <title>Criteria for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting Revealed by Studying Carrier Dynamics in a Model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence study of a model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst reveals that by suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% can be achieved even with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement.







Abstract
Overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising method for solar fuel production. Achieving a high quantum efficiency is one of the most important prerequisites for photocatalysts to realize high solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency. In a recent study (Nature 2020, 58, 411&#8211;414), a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% has been achieved in an aluminum&#8208;doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al) photocatalyst. Herein, using the SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al as a model photocatalyst, we reveal the criteria for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by investigating the carrier dynamics through a comprehensive photoluminescence study. It is found that the Al doping suppresses the generation of Ti3+ recombination centers in SrTiO3, the surface band bending facilitates charge separation, and the in situ photo&#8208;deposited Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH co&#8208;catalysts render efficient charge extraction. By suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, high quantum efficiency can be achieved even on photocatalysts with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement. Our findings could provide guidance on the design of OWS photocatalysts toward more efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a combined experimental and computational study of the bismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes. With the protocol using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol and pinacolborane, we identified the role of protic and hydridic hydrogens through kinetic analysis and reactivity studies. The possibility of Bi&#8208;ligand cooperativity was assessed through isotope labeling experiments. This work validates the notion of Bi(I)/Bi(III) redox cycling.







Abstract
Organobismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation has recently been disclosed as an example of low&#8208;valent Bi redox catalysis. However, its mechanistic details have remained speculative. Herein, we report experimental and computational studies that provide mechanistic insights into a Bi&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol (4) and pinacolborane (5) as hydrogen sources. A kinetic analysis elucidated the rate orders in all components in the catalytic reaction and determined that 1&#8201;a (2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)iminomethyl]phenylbismuth) is the resting state. In the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene using 1&#8201;a and 4, an equilibrium between 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 (Ar=p&#8208;CF3&#8722;C6H4) is observed, and its thermodynamic parameters are established through variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. Additionally, pKa&#8208;gated reactivity is observed, validating the proton&#8208;coupled nature of the transformation. The ensuing 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 is crystallographically characterized, and shown to be rapidly reduced to 1&#8201;a in the presence of 5. DFT calculations indicate a rate&#8208;limiting transition state in which the initial N&#8722;H bond is formed via concerted proton transfer upon nucleophilic addition of 1&#8201;a to a hydrogen&#8208;bonded adduct of azobenzene and 4. These studies guided the discovery of a second&#8208;generation Bi catalyst, the rate&#8208;limiting transition state of which is lower in energy, leading to catalytic transfer hydrogenation at lower catalyst loadings and at cryogenic temperature.

         <title>Kinetic Delay in Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization by Redefining the Trade&#8208;Off Relationship between H&#8208;Bonds and Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper molecular engineering can open new opportunities to create kinetically metastable states in monomers undergoing cooperative supramolecular polymerizations. This occurs by favoring dispersive interactions over H&#8208;bonds and thereby rebalancing the interplay between &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, Van der Waals, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions.







Abstract
We here present how rebalancing the interplay between H&#8208;bonds and dispersive forces (Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) may induce or not the generation of kinetic metastable states. In particular, we show that extending the aromatic content and favouring the interchain VdW interactions causes a delay into the cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a new family of toluene bis&#8208;amide derivatives by trapping the metastable inactive state.

         <title>A Mushroom P450&#8208;Monooxygenase Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Biocatalytic Synthesis of Epoxycyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PanH, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was identified and verified as the enzyme responsible for epoxycyclohexenone formation in panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis. A PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst enabled an enzymatic approach to synthesize a library of bioactive epoxycyclohexenone compounds.







Abstract
An epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) moiety occurs in natural products of both bacteria and ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. While the enzymes for ECH formation in bacteria and ascomycetes have been identified and characterized, it remained obscure how this structure is biosynthesized in basidiomycetes. In this study, we i)&#8197;identified a genetic locus responsible for panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis and ii)&#8197;biochemically characterized PanH, the cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing epoxide formation in this pathway. Using a PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst, we synthesized a small library of bioactive ECH compounds as a proof of concept. Furthermore, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and site directed mutation revealed the substrate specificity of PanH. Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH&#8208;forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.

         <title>Stabilization of Guest Molecules inside Cation&#8208;Lidded Cucurbiturils Reveals that Hydration of Receptor Sites Can Impede Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal ions docked to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors can unexpectedly enhance the binding of guest molecules. For instance, with cucurbit[5]uril and large cations, methane and ethane binding increased 5&#8211;8&#8197;times due to water molecule removal during cation binding. This reveals a previously unnoticed steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites.







Abstract
Docking of alkali metal ions to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors generally reduces the affinity of guest molecules due to competitive binding. The idea that solvation water molecules could display a larger steric hindrance towards guest binding than cations has not been considered to date. We show that the docking of large cations to cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) unexpectedly increases (by a factor of 5&#8211;8) the binding of hydrophobic guests, methane and ethane. This is due to the removal of water molecules from the carbonyl portals of CB5 during cation binding, which frees up space for hydrophobe encapsulation. In contrast, smaller cations like sodium protrude deeply into the cavity of CB5 and cause the expected decrease in binding, such that the rational selection of alkali cations allows for a variation of up to a factor of 20 in binding of methane and ethane. The statistical analysis of crystallographic data shows that the cavity volume of CB5 can be enlarged by placing large alkali ions (Rb+ and Cs+) centro&#8208;symmetrically at the portals. The results reveal a hitherto elusive steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites, which is pertinent for the design of supramolecular catalysts and the understanding of biological receptors.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte Cations Dependent Kinetics on CoOOH&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte cations dependent kinetics on CoOOH catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is derived from cation intercalation, which can rationally tailor the formation energy of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process. This finding provides an informative picture to understand the complicated mechanism of electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The electrolyte cations&#8208;dependent kinetics have been widely observed in many fields of electrocatalysis, however, the exact mechanism of the influence on catalytic performance is still a controversial topic of considerable discussion. Herein, combined with operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we verify that the electrolyte cations could intercalate into the layer of pristine CoOOH catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the bigger cations lead to enlarged interlayer spacing and increased OER activity, following the order Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman, in situ Ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy, in situ XAS spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and theoretical calculations reveal that the intercalation of electrolyte cations efficiently modify the oxidation states of Co by enlarging the Co&#8722;O bonds, which in turn enhance the d&#8208;band center of Co, optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates, facilitate the formation of OER active Co(IV) species, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determing step (RDS), thereby enhancing the OER activity. This work not only provides an informative picture to understand the complicated dependence of OER kinetics on electrolyte cations, but also sheds light on understanding the mechanism of other electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assembly Meets Anion Coordination Chemistry: Framework Shaping and Polarity Tuning for Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage between hydrogen bonding and the coordination chemistry of halide anions offers a promising strategy to construct crystalline microporous frameworks with adaptive cavities and fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity for efficient Xe/Kr separation. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect.







Abstract
Hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) frameworks built from charged components or metallotectons offer diverse guest&#8208;framework interactions for target&#8208;specific separations. We present here a study to systematically explore the coordination chemistry of monovalent halide anions, i.e., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, with the aim to develop hybrid H&#8208;bond synthons that enable the controllable construction of microporous H&#8208;bonded frameworks exhibiting fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity within the adaptive cavities for realistic xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation. The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, are found to readily participate in the charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding assembly with well&#8208;defined coordination behaviors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ca. 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record&#8208;high separation factor (SF=7.0) among H&#8208;bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO2&#8208;containing gas streams exactly mimicking the off&#8208;gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.

The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, are found to readily participate in the charge-assisted H-bonding assembly with well-defined coordination behaviors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ca. 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record-high separation factor (SF=7.0) among H-bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing gas streams exactly mimicking the off-gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8722;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>

Reducing the coordination number is feasible to lower the rate&#8208;determination&#8208;step energy barrier, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction process. Our designed low&#8208;coordination IrOx delivers superior activity as well as excellent stability in water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8722;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8722;O coordination number's role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2 using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accompanied by long durability (100&#8197;h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEM water electrolyzer delivers a low voltage (1.72&#8197;V@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200&#8197;h (@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.

         <title>Construction of Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8722;C2 Single&#8208;Atoms Electrocatalyst Facilitating the Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the special structure of 1,3,5&#8208;triynylbenzene, Cu single atom catalysts with a Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure were prepared for the first time and showed excellent performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) process. Comprehensive experiments and calculations confirmed that the Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu single atoms center with more positive charge, but also promoted the formation of H&#8901;, which improved the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR to CH4.







Abstract
Constructing Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) towards CH4, however there are challenges with activity, selectivity, and a cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta&#8208;position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;, a Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY), containing low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one&#8208;step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure, which exhibited high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity (72.1&#8201;%) with a high CH4 partial current density of 230.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a turnover frequency as high as 2756&#8197;h&#8722;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY. Our work provides a novel H&#8901;&#8208;transferring mechanism for e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 and offers a protocol for the preparation of two&#8208;coordinated Cu SAs catalysts.

         <title>Modulating Coordination of Iron Atom Clusters on N,P,S Triply&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Support towards Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

A general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy is proposed to synthesize metal atom&#8208;clusters with engineered coordination in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon. The optimum FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC shows remarkably enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, compared with the benchmark analogue of N&#8208;coordinated iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C). This work presents a paradigm for the regulation and optimization of atomically dispersed catalysts.







Abstract
Constructing atom&#8208;clusters (ACs) with in situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS&#8722;HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Thereinto, FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC with the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is thoroughly investigated. Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N&#8208;surrounded iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C), FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC comprises bi&#8208;/tri&#8208;atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination. Theoretical calculation reveals that proper Fe gathering and coordination modulation could mildly delocalize the electron distribution and optimize the free energy pathways of ORR. In addition, the triple doping and hollow structure of carbon matrix could further regulate the local environment and allow sufficient exposure of active sites, resulting in more enhanced ORR kinetics on FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC as cathodic catalyst exhibits all&#8208;round superiority to Pt/C and most Fe&#8208;based ADCs. This work provides an exemplary method for establishing atomic&#8208;cluster catalysts with engineered S&#8208;dominated coordination and hollowed carbon matrix, which paves a new avenue for the fabrication and optimization of advanced ADCs.

Abstract
Developing cost&#8208;effective and sustainable acidic water oxidation catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth mechanism understanding for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. Herein, we developed a single atom regulatory strategy to construct Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) catalysts that atomically dispersed zirconium doped Co9S8/Co3O4 heterostructure. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces, engineering attractive activity of significantly reduced overpotential of 75&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a breakthrough of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, and water splitting stability of 500&#8197;hours in acid, making it one of the best&#8208;performing acid&#8208;stable OER non&#8208;noble metal materials. The optimized catalyst with interatomic Co&#8722;Co distance (ca. 2.80&#8197;&#197;) followed oxo&#8208;oxo coupling mechanism that involved obvious oxygen bridges on dinuclear Co sites (1,090&#8197;cm&#8722;1), confirmed by in situ SR&#8208;FTIR, XAFS and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, a major breakthrough of 120,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 high mass current density using the first reported noble metal&#8208;free cobalt anode catalyst of Co&#8722;Co DASs/ZCC in PEM&#8208;WE at 2.14&#8197;V was recorded.

&lt;p&gt;Our study makes a stride in the discovery of acid-stable Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) for PEM through single-atom tuning strategy. The XAFS elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces (HGBIs), engineering attractive activity of ultra-low overpotential and 500&#8197;h superior durability in acid.

         <title>Sterically Allowed H&#8208;type Supramolecular Polymerizations</title>

         <dc:description>
Systematic increase in the bulkiness of dye substituents revealed an unexpected thermodynamic stability of face&#8208;to&#8208;face (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions during supramolecular polymerization. Our results contribute to the development of functional supramolecular polymers by controlling dye&#8208;dye interactions through molecular design.







Abstract
The functionalization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self&#8208;assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H&#8208;type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso&#8208;substituents and compared their self&#8208;assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso&#8208;methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H&#8208;type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non&#8208;covalent interactions in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Fluorogenic Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Glycan&#8208;Binding Protein Recognition Using a Fluorinated Azido&#8208;Coumarin Fucoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoaffinity labeling has been a staple of chemical biology for the capture of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Through conjugation of a trifluorinated 7&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photo&#8208;crosslinking of glycan&#8208;protein interactions. This strategy and these &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; enable traceable photoaffinity labeling and could prove uniquely valuable for imaging biological recognition of glycans.







Abstract
Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.

White&#8208;light emission by sequential F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from thermally robust precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies is unravelled. It is driven by stereocomplex crystallization between two complementary chromophore&#8208;conjugated polylactide stereoisomers in the presence of an external dye.







Abstract
Achieving predictable and programmable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures with specific functions from exclusively organic soft materials remains a scientific challenge. This article unravels stereocomplex crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly as a facile method for producing thermally robust discrete 2D&#8208;platelets of diamond shape from biodegradable semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) scaffolds. The method involves co&#8208;assembling two PLA stereoisomers, namely, PY&#8208;PDLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA, which form stereocomplex (SC)&#8208;crystals in isopropanol. By conjugating a well&#8208;known F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor dye, namely, pyrene (PY) and naphthalene monoimide (NMI), respectively, to the chain termini of these two interacting stereoisomers, a thermally robust FRET process can be stimulated from the 2D array of the co&#8208;assembled dyes on the thermally resilient SC&#8208;PLA crystal surfaces. Uniquely, by decorating the surface of the SC&#8208;PLA crystals with an externally immobilized guest dye, Rhodamine&#8208;B, similar diamond&#8208;shaped structures could be produced that exhibit pure white&#8208;light emission through a surface&#8208;induced two&#8208;step cascade energy transfer process. The FRET response in these systems displays remarkable dependence on the intrinsic crystalline packing, which could be modulated by the chirality of the co&#8208;assembling PLA chains. This is supported by comparing the properties of similar 2D platelets generated from two homochiral PLLAs (PY&#8208;PLLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA) labeled with the same FRET pair.

         <title>A Lantern&#8208;Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low&#8208;Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: An Ancillary Pairings Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cage with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands, with positional and orientational control, has been built by using ancillary pairings. In this approach, the ligands with Pd(II)&#8208;binding sites come together in complementary ways due to their denticity (3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 2&#8201;:&#8201;2) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA&#8201;:&#8201;DD or AD&#8201;:&#8201;DA).







Abstract
One of the key challenges of metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self&#8208;assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity.

     alt="A Lantern-Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low-Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: An Ancillary Pairings Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pd(II) lantern-shaped cage with four different low-symmetry ligands, with positional and orientational control, has been built by using ancillary pairings. In this approach, the ligands with Pd(II)-binding sites come together in complementary ways due to their denticity (3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 2&#8201;:&#8201;2) and/or hydrogen-bonding capability (AA&#8201;:&#8201;DD or AD&#8201;:&#8201;DA).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges of metallo-supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self-assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity. In palladium(II) quadruply stranded lantern-shaped cages, this has been achieved through either 1)&#8197;the formation of heteroleptic (multi-ligand) assemblies, or 2)&#8197;homoleptic assemblies from low-symmetry ligands. Heteroleptic cages formed from low-symmetry ligands, a hybid of these two approaches, would add an additional rich level of complexity but no examples of these have been reported. Here we use a system of ancillary complementary ligand pairings at the termini of cage ligands to target heteroleptic assemblies: these complementary pairs can only interact (through coordination to a single Pd(II) metal ion) between ligands in a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; position on the cage. Complementarity between each pair (and orthogonality to other pairs) is controlled by denticity (tridentate to monodentate or bidentate to bidentate) and/or hydrogen-bonding capability (AA to DD or AD to DA). This allows positional and orientational control over ligands with different ancillary sites.

         <title>Artificial Peptide&#8208;Protein Necrosomes Promote Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural feature of natural necrosome, kinase&#8208;biomimetic D&#8208;retro&#8208;inverso peptides (DRI&#8208;peptides) are designed and able to strongly associate with kinases. This feature of the peptides facilitates formation of artificial peptide&#8208;protein necrosomes and thus selectively activating the necrotic signaling pathway to induce cellular necroptosis.







Abstract
The presence of disordered region or large interacting surface within proteins significantly challenges the development of targeted drugs, commonly known as the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue. Here, we report a heterogeneous peptide&#8208;protein assembling strategy to selectively phosphorylate proteins, thereby activating the necroptotic signaling pathway and promoting cell necroptosis. Inspired by the structures of natural necrosomes formed by receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3, the kinase&#8208;biomimetic peptides are rationally designed by incorporating natural or D&#8208;amino acids, or connecting D&#8208;amino acids in a retro&#8208;inverso (DRI) manner, leading to one RIPK3&#8208;biomimetic peptide PR3 and three RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides. Individual peptides undergo self&#8208;assembly into nanofibrils, whereas mixing RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides with PR3 accelerates and enhances assembly of PR3. In particular, RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptide DRI&#8208;PR1 exhibits reliable binding affinity with protein RIPK3, resulting in specific cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells that overexpress RIPK3. Mechanistic studies reveal the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 induced by RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides, elucidating the activation of the necroptotic signaling pathway responsible for cell death without an obvious increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;protein hybrid aggregation as a promising approach to address the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue and provide alternative strategies for overcoming cancer resistance in the future.

         <title>Substrates and Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors of the Oligonucleotide&#8208;Activated Sirtuin 7
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Broad screening of the substrate specificity of SIRT7 revealed a strong preference for the cleavage of long&#8208;chain acyllysine modifications. The activity was substantially increased in the presence of oligonucleotides or nucleosome particles. Finally, random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) delivered a cyclopeptide with potency in the sub&#8208;micromolar range and selectivity for SIRT7, which binds and stabilizes SIRT7 in cells.







Abstract
The sirtuins are NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases, comprising seven isoforms (SIRT1&#8211;7) in humans, which are involved in the regulation of a plethora of biological processes, including gene expression and metabolism. The sirtuins share a common hydrolytic mechanism but display preferences for different &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine substrates. SIRT7 deacetylates targets in nuclei and nucleoli but remains one of the lesser studied of the seven isoforms, in part due to a lack of chemical tools to specifically probe SIRT7 activity. Here we expressed SIRT7 and, using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, reveal SIRT7 to be a monomeric enzyme with a low degree of globular flexibility in solution. We developed a fluorogenic assay for investigation of the substrate preferences of SIRT7 and to evaluate compounds that modulate its activity. We report several mechanism&#8208;based SIRT7 inhibitors as well as de novo cyclic peptide inhibitors selected from mRNA&#8208;display library screening that exhibit selectivity for SIRT7 over other sirtuin isoforms, stabilize SIRT7 in cells, and cause an increase in the acetylation of H3&#8201;K18.

         <title>Rational Design of an Air&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Spin Diradical with Diazapyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method has been developed for installing stable polyradicals into polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, as illustrated by the formation of an air&#8208;stable, high&#8208;spin carbon&#8208;based diradical with a new ferromagnetic coupling motif of diazapyrene. The structure of the diradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, while the magnetic measurements provided unambiguous evidence for the high&#8208;spin ground state and a long spin relaxation process.







Abstract
Stable carbon&#8208;based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin&#8208;spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif synthesized by a convenient method that allows the integration of stable, high&#8208;spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles has been developed, as illustrated by a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical showing a triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2&#8776;31&#8197;h) in air. Compared to the widely used 1,3&#8208;phenylene, the newly designed (diaza)pyrene&#8208;4,10&#8208;diyl moiety is for the first time demonstrated to confer ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling, allowing delocalized non&#8208;disjoint SOMOs. With the X&#8208;ray crystallography unambiguously proving the diradical structure, the triplet ground state was thoroughly characterized. A large &#916;ES&#8208;T of 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol, proving the strong FM coupling effect, was revealed consistently by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, while the zero&#8208;field splitting and triplet nutation characters were examined by continuous&#8208;wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy. A millisecond spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time was also detected. The current study not only offers a new molecular motif enabling FM coupling between carbon&#8208;based spins, but more importantly presents a general method for installing stable polyradicals into functional &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular customization strategy was applied for efficient MOF membrane fabrication. MOF material screening, defect&#8208;free membrane output, membrane physicochemical property regulation and separation applications can be rapidly realized by separately designing and modifying the MOF module within the membrane. High separation performance is easily achieved, which can meet diverse separation requirements.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy&#8208;efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect&#8208;free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel microenvironment, and consequently, an intriguing H2/CO2 separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656&#8211;5.4, H2 permeance of 964&#8211;2745 gas permeation unit). Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non&#8208;destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full&#8208;chain demonstration for membrane fabrication&#8208;separation validation&#8208;microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.

&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy-efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long-standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect-free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel microenvironment, and consequently, an intriguing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656&#8211;5.4, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 964&#8211;2745 gas permeation unit). Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non-destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full-chain demonstration for membrane fabrication-separation validation-microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Construction of Highly Substituted Piperidines via Dearomative Functionalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction of pyridines generates highly substituted piperidines, featuring diverse functional handles, with excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity. The origin of the unprecedented selectivities and additional insights into the reaction mechanism are discussed based on combined experimental mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six&#8208;membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles are well&#8208;established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site&#8208;selectivity, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.

         <title>Lattice Distortion and H&#8208;passivation in Pure Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Stable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new understanding on the activation of 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of carbon materials, through H&#8208;passivated and distorted lattices, and demonstrated how carbon cloth can be offered via this strategy with excellent and stable 2e&#8722; ORR for the H2O2 production.







Abstract
The exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for chemical and energy industries. Carbon materials have been proved promising with different catalysts enabling 2 and 4e&#8722; ORR. Nevertheless, their ORR activity and selectivity is still complex and under debate in many cases. Many structures of these active carbon materials are also chemically unstable for practical implementations. Unlike the well&#8208;discussed structures, this work presents a strategy to promote efficient and stable 2e&#8722; ORR of carbon materials through the synergistic effect of lattice distortion and H&#8208;passivation (on the distorted structure). We show how these structures can be formed on carbon cloth, and how the reproducible chemical adsorption can be realized on these structures for efficient and stable H2O2 production. The work here gives not only new understandings on the 2e&#8722; ORR catalysis, but also the robust catalyst which can be directly used in industry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Synthesis of a Collagen&#8208;inspired Covalent Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic covalent helical polymers in solid form are in high demand. By biomimicry, we designed a dipeptide monomer containing azide and alkyne that organize in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail as supramolecular helices in their crystals. Upon heating, the monomer undergoes SCSC TAAC polymerization to yield a covalent helical polymer. Single crystals of this fully organic polymer show high flexural strength, compressive strength and load&#8208;bearing capacity.







Abstract
There is much demand for crystalline covalent helical polymers. Inspired by the helical structure of collagen, we synthesized a covalent helical polymer wherein the repeating dipeptide Gly&#8208;Pro units are connected by triazole linkages. We synthesized an azide and alkyne&#8208;modified dipeptide monomer made up of the repeating amino acid sequence of collagen. In its crystals, the monomer molecules aligned in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion with proximally placed azide and alkyne forming supramolecular helices. At 60&#8201;&#176;C, the monomer underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a covalent helical polymer as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Compared to the monomer crystals, the polymer single&#8208;crystals were very strong and showed three&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus, which is higher than collagen, many synthetic polymers and other materials. The crystals of this covalent helical polymer could bear loads as high as 1.5&#8197;million times of their own weight without deformation. These crystals could also withstand high compression force and did not disintegrate even at an applied force of 98&#8197;kN. Such light&#8208;weight strong materials are in demand for various technological applications.

A design strategy toward near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes based on utilization of an antiaromatic azepine is reported by Masahito Murai, Takahiro Enoki, and Shigehiro Yamaguchi in their Research Article (e202311445). While benzo&#8208;fused azepines take bent conformations, which undergo large structural relaxation to planar conformations in the excited state, thieno&#8208;fused congeners with electron&#8208;accepting groups at both termini adopt flat conformations even in the ground state, giving rise to NIR&#8208;emissions that exceed 850 nm.

Electrochemical 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation is a sustainable tool for introducing important vicinal diol&#8208;related structures in alkenes. The scuba divers in the cover picture perform the highly efficient diacetoxylation of alkenes using renewable electricity as the driving force, as reported by Dirk De&#8197;Vos and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311539). Excellent yields are obtained with a wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes in an atom&#8208;efficient and versatile protocol, with also application to lactone synthesis.

The rational design of metal oxide catalysts is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202310062), Bingsen Zhang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko, Zhong&#8208;Wen Liu et&#8197;al. report that structural properties of supported/bulk metal oxides can be controlled through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8901;H2O solution because of dissolution and simultaneous precipitation of individual catalyst components. The method enables to tailor catalyst reducibility that plays a pivotal role for C&#8722;H bond activation in hydrocarbons.

This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions and their applications for different therapeutic targets. In addition, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for expanding their practical application.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry is a promising toolbox for dissecting biological processes in the native environment. Recently, bioorthogonal reactions have attracted considerable attention in the medical field for treating diseases, since this approach may lead to improved drug efficacy and reduced side effects via in situ drug synthesis. For precise biomedical applications, it is a prerequisite that the reactions should occur in the right locations and on the appropriate therapeutic targets. In this minireview, we highlight the design and development of targeted bioorthogonal reactions for precise medical treatment. First, we compile recent strategies for achieving target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions. Further, we emphasize their application for the precise treatment of different therapeutic targets.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal chemistry is a promising toolbox for dissecting biological processes in the native environment. Recently, bioorthogonal reactions have attracted considerable attention in the medical field for treating diseases, since this approach may lead to improved drug efficacy and reduced side effects via in situ drug synthesis. For precise biomedical applications, it is a prerequisite that the reactions should occur in the right locations and on the appropriate therapeutic targets. In this minireview, we highlight the design and development of targeted bioorthogonal reactions for precise medical treatment. First, we compile recent strategies for achieving target-specific bioorthogonal reactions. Further, we emphasize their application for the precise treatment of different therapeutic targets. Finally, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for safe, efficient, and translatable disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advantages of using C&#8722;F bonds as functional handles for chemical synthesis. Specific examples are used to illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can streamline small molecule synthesis and enable new reactions. The goal of this review is to educate chemists on the opportunities available for incorporating C&#8722;F bonds in synthetic route planning and for exploiting the unique mechanistic pathways available to C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8722;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8722;F bonds. As such, C&#8722;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advances of defluorinative functionalization are discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8722;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8722;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.

COFs are emerging and promising candidates in photocatalytic H2O2 production. Significant progress has developed in the past several years. However, comprehensive reviews on this specific field are lacking. This minireview presents an overview of the development of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production, highlighting the recent strategies to optimize COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The insights into the future development of industrial&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective H2O2 production are also offered.







Abstract
Benefiting from the excellent structural tunability, robust framework, ultrahigh porosity, and rich active sites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are widely recognized as promising photocatalysts in chemical conversions, and emerged in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis in 2020. H2O2, serving as an environmental&#8208;friendly oxidant and a promising liquid fuel, has attracted increasing researchers to explore its potential. Over the past few years, numerous COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H2O2 production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H2O2 photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value&#8208;added chemicals not limited to H2O2.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Metals in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) facilitates exceptional gas&#8208;phase catalytic activity, stabilization of solution&#8208;inaccessible catalysts, and fundamental insight into pertinent reaction mechanisms. MOFs present an ideal porous, crystalline, and chemically mutable matrix for such species. Herein we examine synthesis techniques and applications for the matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide uniquely tunable, periodic platforms for site&#8208;isolation of reactive low&#8208;valent metal complexes of relevance in modern catalysis, adsorptive applications, and fundamental structural studies. Strategies for integrating such species in MOFs include post&#8208;synthetic metalation, encapsulation and direct synthesis using low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes as building blocks. These approaches have each proven effective in enhancing catalytic activity, modulating product distributions (i.e., by improving catalytic selectivity), and providing valuable mechanistic insights. In this minireview, we explore these different strategies, as applied to isolate low&#8208;valent species within MOFs, with a particular focus on examples that leverage the unique crystallinity, permanent porosity and chemical mutability of MOFs to achieve deep structural insights that lead to new paradigms in the field of hybrid catalysis.

The multifunctionality of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based textiles encourages innovation of a wearable platform technology capable of sensing, filtration, detoxification, and catalysis. This Review focuses on the implementation of MOFs at the fiber level to form functional components in smart textiles.







Abstract
Owing to high modularity and synthetic tunability, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles are poised to contribute to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable systems with multifunctional performance. While these composite materials have demonstrated promising functions in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF&#8208;integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis. Building upon these recent advances, this review concludes with an outlook on emerging opportunities for the diverse applications of MOF@textile systems in the realm of smart wearables.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Enones via Chloroacylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (enones) and esters. Regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides and chloroformates takes place under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.







Abstract
Here, we show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched enones via regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides. The method relies upon the initial in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the acyl chloride precursor under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.

Regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides and chloroformates takes place under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;-branched enones via regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides. The method relies upon the initial in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the acyl chloride precursor under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Arylglycines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Sch&#246;llkopf Bis&#8208;Lactim Ethers with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide promotes the coupling of chiral tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived Sch&#246;llkopf bis&#8208;lactim ether with cheap aryl chlorides at room temperature in yields up to 95&#8201;% and &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. This enables a convenient access to non&#8208;natural tertiary arylglycines, which are key structural motifs in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This protocol is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of common pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Arylglycines are important pharmacophores present in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This compound class has now been made accessible from abundant aryl chlorides by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type amino acid synthesis. In the presence of the catalyst methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide, the base lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidide and the additive ZnCl2, tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived bis&#8208;lactim ethers were efficiently arylated at room temperature, reaching yields of 95&#8201;% and diastereoselectivities of 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding arylglycines in high enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Uniform Colloidal Polymer Rods by Stabilizer&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform colloidal polymer rods/disks with tunable aspect ratios and well&#8208;defined internal molecular packing and orientations were successfully achieved from homopolymers or random copolymers by stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. They show an unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying memory effect, which have been used for high&#8208;level encryption and secure delivery of paper documents.







Abstract
The synthesis of anisotropic colloidal building blocks is essential for their self&#8208;assembly into hierarchical materials. Here, a highly efficient stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (SA&#8208;LCDSA) strategy was developed to achieve monodisperse colloidal polymer rods. This strategy does not require the use of block copolymers, but only homopolymers or random copolymers. The resulting rods have tunable size and aspect ratios, as well as well&#8208;defined columnar liquid crystal structures. The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA&#8208;LCDSA&#8208;based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;&#8208;molecular units.

         <title>Regulation of Multiple Resonance Delayed Fluorescence via Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited State towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual steric and electronic effects of through&#8208;space charge transfer excited states have been exploited to concurrently shorten the delayed fluorescence lifetime and mitigate the aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of multiple resonance B&#8722;N emitter. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new emitter show high efficiencies, small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability.







Abstract
B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters usually suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching. Here, we report the design of a sandwich structure by placing the B&#8722;N MR core between two electron&#8208;donating moieties, inducing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) states. The proper adjusting of the energy levels brings about a 10&#8208;fold higher RISC rate in comparison with the parent B&#8722;N molecule. In the meantime, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91&#8201;% and a good color purity were maintained. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new MR emitter achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.7&#8201;% and small roll&#8208;offs at high brightness. High device efficiencies were also obtained for a wide range of doping concentrations of up to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% thanks to the steric shielding of the B&#8722;N core. A good operational stability with LT95 of 85.2&#8197;h has also been revealed. The dual steric and electronic effects resulting from the introduction of a TSCT state offer an effective molecular design to address the critical challenges of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Toughening Brittle Bio&#8208;P3HB with Synthetic P3HB of Engineered Stereomicrostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The longstanding mechanical brittleness issue associated with stereoperfect biological or synthetic P3HB is solved through blending it with synthetic P3HB with specifically engineered stereomicrostructures, which not only drastically enhances the toughness by &gt;156&#215; and optical clarity but also largely maintains its otherwise desirably high elastic modulus, tensile strength, melting temperature.







Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), a biologically produced, biodegradable natural polyester, exhibits excellent thermal and barrier properties but suffers from mechanical brittleness, largely limiting its applications. Here we report a mono&#8208;material product design strategy to toughen stereoperfect, brittle bio or synthetic P3HB by blending it with stereomicrostructurally engineered P3HB. Through tacticity ([mm] from 0 to 100&#8201;%) and molecular weight (Mn to 788&#8197;kDa) tuning, high&#8208;performance synthetic P3HB materials with tensile strength to &#8776;30&#8197;MPa, fracture strain to &#8776;800&#8201;%, and toughness to 126&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 (&gt;110&#215; tougher than bio&#8208;P3HB) have been produced. Physical blending of the brittle P3HB with such P3HB in 10 to 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% dramatically enhances its ductility from &#8776;5&#8201;% to 95&#8211;450&#8201;% and optical clarity from 19&#8201;% to 85&#8201;% visible light transmittance while maintaining desirably high elastic modulus (&gt;1&#8197;GPa), tensile strength (&gt;35&#8197;MPa), and melting temperature (160&#8211;170&#8201;&#176;C). This P3HB&#8208;toughening&#8208;P3HB methodology departs from the traditional approach of incorporating chemically distinct components to toughen P3HB, which hinders chemical or mechanical recycling, highlighting the potential of the mono&#8208;material product design solely based on biodegradable P3HB to deliver P3HB materials with diverse performance properties.

         <dc:description>
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension on different elementary units (triptycene vs. triphenylene), demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising molecular innovation platforms for organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension. When applied in small molecular acceptors, the only two cases of CH25 and CH26 that could contain six terminals and such broad conjugated backbones have been afforded thus far, rendering featured absorptions, small reorganization and exciton binding energies. Moreover, their distinctive but completely different molecular geometries result in sharply contrasting nanoscale film morphologies. Finally, CH26 contributes to the best device efficiency of 15.41&#8201;% among acceptors with six terminals, demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising 6&#8208;cantilever molecular innovation platforms.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Transfer Protocol for the Hydroxyalkenylation of Alkenes Using 1,2&#8208;Bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation by 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene was developed using persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron oxidizing reagent. Regioselective hydroxyalkenylation was observed for a variety of substituted alkenes. A photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation using an acridinium salt was also successful.







Abstract
We report a protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation. Using a persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation reagent and 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene as a radical acceptor in the presence of water, alkenes were converted into the corresponding 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyalkenes in good to high yields. The hydroxyalkenylation process involves the nucleophilic hydroxylation of alkene radical cations to give &#946;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals, which, after a radical addition/&#946;&#8208;elimination sequence, provide the products. We also report a photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation.

         <title>Modulating Ligand&#8208;Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo&#8208;polymers. The reversible sorting process can be conducted through a typical solvent extraction procedure.







Abstract
The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, &#8776;2&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford the corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned by the recipe of the star polymer mixtures used. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction procedure. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted through the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Mediator Duality of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene acts as a substrate and a mediator in an electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction with alkyl bromides. The reaction conditions avoid competing alkyl radical homocoupling and allows for the accommodation of alkyl bromides with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups that are difficult to incorporate using alternative C(sp3) precursors.







Abstract
Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp3) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon&#8208;centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp3) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical&#8208;radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross&#8208;coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal&#8208;free regioselective cross&#8208;coupling of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross&#8208;selectivity to form 1,4&#8208;alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross&#8208;coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp3) precursors.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Cyanoacetates Enabled by Chiral Amide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates was achieved by Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates under the assistance of two types of chiral ligands, (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamides and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amides. The reaction afforded the coupling products bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamide and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amide are effective ligands for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl iodides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates. This arylation reaction gave &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups. The size of both &#945;&#8208;alkyl and ester groups was proven as the key factor for asymmetric induction.

         <title>Clustering Six Electrons within &#8220;Dawson&#8208;Like&#8221; Polyoxometalate: An Open Route toward Its Post&#8208;functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The super&#8208;reduction of Dawson&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM) [H2AsW18O60]7&#8722; in water involves a disproportionation process generating POM with a metal&#8208;metal bonded triad as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance investigations. Then, the resulting six&#8208;electron reduced POM was used as a precursor to construct the largest POM containing W4+ reported to date.







Abstract
Super&#8208;reduction of polyoxometalates (POMs) in solution is of fundamental interest for designing innovative energy storage systems. In this article, we show that the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM can undergo a disproportionation process during its massive electron uptake, leading to species containing three metal&#8208;metal bonds as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 183W NMR), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), UV/Vis, and voltammetry techniques. This result indicates that electron storing within metal&#8208;metal bonds is not a unique property of Keggin&#8208;type POM as postulated since the 70s. Besides, we demonstrate that the presence of an electron&#8208;rich triad in the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM allows its post&#8208;functionalization with additional tungstate ions, generating a chiral molecule that is also the largest WIV&#8208;containing POMs known to date.

         <title>Enhanced Gain in Organic Photodetectors Using the Polymer with Singlet Open&#8208;Shell Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving high photoresponse and low dark or noise current with a fast response speed under a low bias in polymer photodetectors, this study demonstrates the potential of incorporating the polymer with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state in the active layer to enhance the performance of organic photodetectors.







Abstract
Photodetectors are critical components in intelligent optoelectronic systems, and photomultiplication&#8208;capable devices are essential for detecting weak optical signals. Despite significant advances, developing photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors with high gain and low noise current simultaneously remains challenging. In this work, a new conjugated polymer PDN with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state is introduced in active layers for electron capture, and the corresponding PDN&#8208;based photodetectors exhibited an enhanced photoelectric gain and decreased dark current density at a low forward bias. At 1.5&#8197;V, the PDN&#8208;based ternary photodetector has the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 2552.3&#8201;% and the specific detectivity of 1.4&#215;1014&#8197;Jones at 710&#8197;nm calculated by the measured noise current, with the gain 22&#8197;times higher than that of the control group. This study provides an approach for exploiting polymers with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state to enhance the gain of organic photodetectors.

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective radical&#8208;radical coupling using combined photoredox/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis was developed. The coupling of a ketyl radical and an sp3&#8208;carbon radical allows access to &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.







Abstract
An enantioselective carbene&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;radical coupling of acyl imidazoles and racemic Hantzsch esters is disclosed. This method involves the coupling of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived ketyl radical and a secondary sp3&#8208;carbon radical and allows access to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl aliphatic ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities without any competitive epimerization. The utility of this protocol is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various pharmaceutical compounds and is further demonstrated by the transformation of the enantioenriched products to biologically relevant molecules. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled enantioselective desymmetrization of a novel dibromocyclobutene facilitates access to a versatile cyclobutene intermediate that can be functionalized to access a wide range of chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes and cyclobutanes.







Abstract
Four&#8208;membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into various saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification.

     alt="Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4-Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Dual-Catalyzed Photoredox Cross-Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metallaphotoredox-enabled enantioselective desymmetrization of a novel dibromocyclobutene facilitates access to a versatile cyclobutene intermediate that can be functionalized to access a wide range of chiral 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes and cyclobutanes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into various saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri- and tetra-C-substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification. Herein, a divergent synthetic strategy was developed where a single optically enriched scaffold is diversified into a variety of derivatives with different substitution patterns. To this end, the enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral 1,2-dibromocyclobutene imides was enabled by a dual Ir/Ni-catalyzed photoredox C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling with an alkyltrifluoroborate salt to install a convertible carbon fragment in good yields and &amp;gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Exceptional mono-coupling selectivity is observed and the resulting chiral bromocyclobutene serves as a common scaffold that can be transformed in a divergent manner into several valuable 1,2,3,4-tetra-C-substituted cyclobutane products while maintaining optical purity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Spin and Reactive Fe13 Cluster with Exposed Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high nuclearity Fe13 cluster with metal&#8208;metal interactions was prepared from a WFe3S3 precursor. This compound displays a large room temperature spin value and undergoes core structural rearrangement upon multielectron group transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Atomically defined large metal clusters have applications in new reaction development and preparation of materials with tailored properties. Expanding the synthetic toolbox for reactive high nuclearity metal complexes, we report a new class of Fe clusters, Tp*4W4Fe13S12, displaying a Fe13 core with M&#8722;M bonds that has precedent only in main group and late metal chemistry. M13 clusters with closed shell electron configurations can show significant stability and have been classified as superatoms. In contrast, Tp*4W4Fe13S12 displays a large spin ground state of S=13. This compound performs small molecule activations involving the transfer of up to 12 electrons resulting in significant cluster rearrangements.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and properties of the radical cations of mixed&#8208;valence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trimers have remained elusive because of their intrinsic instability. This has been overcome by the reaction of BN&#8208;doped corannulenes with oxidants. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting compounds demonstrated the existence of two unpaired electrons, and theoretical calculations confirmed the uneven distribution of spin density.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structure and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8722; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of a forbidden transition (&#916;ms=&#177;2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;&#8208;trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable&#8208;temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties.

         <title>Coding Intrinsic Disorder into DNA Hybridization Probes Enables Discrimination of Single Nucleotide Variants over Wide and Tunable Temperature Ranges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Classic hybridization probes for discriminating single nucleotide mutations typically work at elevated temperatures and in very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T) due to the high entropy penalty. By adding intrinsic disorder into hybridization probes, we successfully expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
DNA hybridization probes are commonly used tools to discriminate clinically important single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but often work at elevated temperatures with very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T). Herein, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the narrow &#916;T both in silico and experimentally. Our study revealed that the high entropy penalty of classic hybridization probe designs was the key attributor for the narrow &#916;T. Guided by this finding, we further introduced an entropy&#8208;compensate probe (Sprobe) design by coding intrinsic disorder into a stem&#8208;loop hybridization probe. Sprobe expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, both &#916;T and the optimal reaction temperature can be fine&#8208;tuned by simply altering the length of the loop domain. Sprobe was clinically validated by analyzing EGFR L858R mutation in 36&#8197;pairs of clinical tumor tissue samples collected from lung cancer patients, which revealed 100&#8201;% clinical sensitivity and specificity. We anticipate that our study will serve as a general guide for designing thermal robust hybridization probes for clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Imidazole&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was synthesized via the one&#8208;pot Debus&#8208;Radziszewski multicomponent reaction. The material showed excellent two electron oxygen&#8208;reduction activity and when it was used as cathode catalyst and assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long&#8208;ranged non&#8208;conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7) is synthesized through the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction of the saddle&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) selectivity of 83.4&#8201;%. When the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The accumulative amount of H2O2 could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment&#8208;related field.

&lt;p&gt;The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long-ranged non-conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole-linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT-COF-7) is synthesized through the one-pot multicomponent Debus-Radziszewski reaction of the saddle-shaped aldehyde-substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT-COF-7, as a metal-free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) selectivity of 83.4&#8201;%. When the BUCT-COF-7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The accumulative amount of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment-related field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The intermolecular carbophosphination reaction of alkynes or alkenes with unreactive C&#8722;P bonds remains an elusive challenge. Herein, we used a Ni&#8722;Al bimetallic catalyst to realize an intermolecular carbophosphination reaction of alkynes with 5&#8208;membered phosphole oxides, providing a series of 7&#8208;membered phosphepines in up to 94&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Geometrically Compelled Silicon(II)/Silicon(IV) Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Enables the Enamination of Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles bearing a side arm of the silylenyl group are prepared, all featuring the unique silicon(II)&#8594;silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction that facilitates the enamination of &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles to afford the edge&#8208;fused Si&#8208;heterotricycles.







Abstract
Discovering new bonding scenarios and subsequently exploring the reactivity contribute substantially to advance the main group element chemistry. Herein, we report on the isolation and characterization of an intriguing class of the hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles 2&#8211;4. These compounds exhibit a side arm of the amidinatosilylenyl group, featuring unidirectional silicon(II)/silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction on account of the geometric constraint. Furthermore, the reactions involving 2&#8211;4 with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge&#8208;fused of the Si&#8208;heteroimidazolidine&#8208;CN2Si2, silole&#8208;C4Si, and phenyl&#8208;C6&#8208;rings (5&#8211;13). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H&#8208;shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.

Small cobalt nanoparticles readily oxidize under CO2 hydrogenation conditions according to X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, favoring reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction, in contrast to larger particles that remain metallic and catalyze methanation.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts are well&#8208;known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co&#8208;NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0&#8197;nm. These SOMC&#8208;derived Co&#8208;NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO2 hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6&#8197;nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8211;3.0&#8197;nm) favor the expected methanation activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water&#8208;gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO2 hydrogenation conditions.

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stage engineering strategy, i.e., the construction of strain&#8208;resistant ultrafine&#8208;grains and subsequent intergranular fluorination of the refined grains synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) cathode, effectively alleviating the structural degradation and gas generation, thereby enabling a long battery life.







Abstract
Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain&#8208;resistant microstructure in Mo&#8208;doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode&#8208;electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo&#8208;doped NC96 cathode by forming an F&#8208;induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery's lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanorods with Five&#8208;Fold Rotational Symmetry and Orientation&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Properties of Their Monomers and Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scattering dissymmetry factor (gs&#8208;factor) peaks of the horizontal chiral Au nanorods are redshifted with higher intensities compared to those of the vertical chiral Au nanorods. The intensity of the chiral response of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side chiral nanorod dimers is reduced because of the coupling between the plasmon resonance modes.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their strong chiroptical responses and broad scientific applications. However, the types of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have remained limited. Herein we report on a new type of chiral nanoparticle, chiral Au nanorod (NR) with five&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which is synthesized using chiral molecules. Three different types of Au seeds (Au elongated nanodecahedrons, nanodecahedrons, and nanobipyramids) are used to study the growth behaviors. Different synthesis parameters, including the chiral molecules, surfactant, reductant, seeds, and Au precursor, are systematically varied to optimize the chiroptical responses of the chiral Au NRs. The chiral scattering measurements on the individual chiral Au NRs and their dimers are performed. Intriguingly, the chiroptical signals of the individual chiral Au NRs and their end&#8208;to&#8208;end dimers are similar, while those of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side dimers are largely reduced. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations reveal that the different chiroptical responses of the chiral NR dimers are originated from the coupling effect between the plasmon resonance modes. Our study enriches chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and provides valuable insight for the design of plasmonic nanostructures with desired chiroptical properties.

         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;BF3 complexes derived from alicyclic amines represent novel building blocks that are readily prepared in a single synthetic operation. These complexes engage with a wide range of organometallic nucleophiles to afford &#945;&#8208;functionalized azacycles, typically under non&#8208;cryogenic conditions. The in situ preparation of imine&#8208;BF3 complexes provides access to &#945;&#8208;functionalized morpholines and piperazines directly from their parent amines.







Abstract
A new strategy to access &#945;&#8208;functionalized alicyclic amines via their corresponding imine&#8208;BF3 complexes is reported. Isolable imine&#8208;BF3 complexes, readily prepared via dehydrohalogenation of N&#8208;bromoamines in a base&#8208;promoted/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 catalyzed process followed by addition of boron trifluoride etherate, undergo reactions with a wide range of organometallic nucleophiles to afford &#945;&#8208;functionalized azacycles. Organozinc and organomagnesium nucleophiles add at ambient temperatures, obviating the need for cryogenic conditions. In situ preparation of imine&#8208;BF3 complexes provides access to &#945;&#8208;functionalized morpholines and piperazines directly from their parent amines in a single operation. &#945;&#8208;Functionalized morpholines can be elaborated further, for instance by installing a second substituent in the &#945;&#8242;&#8208;position.

         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis typically operates through the transfer of a single electron. The resulting hybrid Pd radical species can participate in a range of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional 2&#8208;electron processes. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this emerging area.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis has emerged as a promising subfield of photocatalysis. The hybrid nature of Pd radical species has enabled a wide array of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional Pd chemistry. In parallel to the ongoing pursuit of alternative, readily available radical precursors, notable discoveries have demonstrated that photoexcitation can alter not only oxidative addition but also other elementary steps. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this area.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate, Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, with the consistent&#8208;orientation&#8208;alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra exhibits an exceptionally large dipole moment, yielding a wide deep&#8208;UV transparent window, an enhanced SHG response of ca. 2.3&#8197;times that of KDP, and a suited birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180&#8197;nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.

         <title>Spiroluchuene A Synthase: A Cyclase from Aspergillus luchuensis Forming a Spirotetracyclic Diterpene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diterpene synthase for spiroluchuene A exhibiting a novel skeleton was discovered from Aspergillus luchuensis. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allowed for the isolation of spiroluchuene B and the intermediate spiroluchuene. The enzyme mechanism was deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The thermal reactions of luchudiene were studied.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AlTS was identified from Aspergillus luchuensis. AlTS catalyses the formation of the diterpene hydrocarbon spiroluchuene A, which exhibits a novel skeleton characterised by a spirocyclic ring system. The cyclisation mechanism towards this compound was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The biosynthetic intermediate luchudiene, besides the derivative spiroluchuene B, was captured from an enzyme variant obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. With its 10&#8208;membered ring luchudiene is structurally related to germacrenes and can undergo a Cope rearrangement to luchuelemene.

         <title>Revealing the CO2 Conversion at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Nanoscale Visualization Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy&#8208;differential interference contrast microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we explored the electrode/electrolyte interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The results indicate that the laser alters the reaction pathways of the CO2 reduction processes, which changes the morphological evolution of the discharge products at the interfaces, and in turn, afftects the cell performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) battery technology presents a promising opportunity for carbon capture and energy storage. Despite tremendous efforts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the complex electrode/electrolyte/CO2 triple&#8208;phase interfacial processes remain poorly understood, in particular at the nanoscale. Here, using in situ atomic force microscopy and laser confocal microscopy&#8208;differential interference contrast microscopy, we directly observed the CO2 conversion processes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries at the nanoscale, and further revealed a laser&#8208;tuned reaction pathway based on the real&#8208;time observations. During discharge, a bi&#8208;component composite, Li2CO3/C, deposits as micron&#8208;sized clusters through a 3D progressive growth model, followed by a 3D decomposition pathway during the subsequent recharge. When the cell operates under laser (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) irradiation, densely packed Li2CO3/C flakes deposit rapidly during discharge. Upon the recharge, they predominantly decompose at the interfaces of the flake and electrode, detaching themselves from the electrode and causing irreversible capacity degradation. In situ Raman shows that the laser promotes the formation of poorly soluble intermediates, Li2C2O4, which in turn affects growth/decomposition pathways of Li2CO3/C and the cell performance. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and the laser&#8208;tuned CO2 conversion reactions, which can inspire strategies of monitoring and controlling the multistep and multiphase interfacial reactions in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the discovered aptamer, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted blockade of the immune suppressor Siglec&#8208;15 (sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15) for cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the developed aptamer&#8208;based immunotherapy amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model by augmenting of macrophage and T cell functionality.







Abstract
The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15 (Siglec&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells and tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, which is mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Siglec&#8208;15 protein/Siglec&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Interfacial Preparation of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hybrid Supramolecular Polymers by Orthogonal Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient strategy is developed to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymers (POM&#8208;SPs) by interfacial orthogonal self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions, POM&#8208;SP&#8208;based interfacial assemblies with redox or competitive agent responsiveness can be achieved.







Abstract
The construction of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid supramolecular polymers using polyoxometalate (POM) as building block is expected to bring new opportunities to the functionalization of supramolecular polymers and the development of novel POM&#8208;based soft materials. Here, by using the orthogonal self&#8208;assembly based on host&#8211;guest interactions and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, we report the in situ construction of a novel POM&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymer (POM&#8208;SP) at the oil&#8208;water interface, while the redox and competitive responsiveness can be triggered independently.

     alt="Interfacial Preparation of Polyoxometalate-Based Hybrid Supramolecular Polymers by Orthogonal Self-Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and efficient strategy is developed to prepare polyoxometalate-based hybrid supramolecular polymers (POM-SPs) by interfacial orthogonal self-assembly. Owing to the dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions, POM-SP-based interfacial assemblies with redox or competitive agent responsiveness can be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid supramolecular polymers using polyoxometalate (POM) as building block is expected to bring new opportunities to the functionalization of supramolecular polymers and the development of novel POM-based soft materials. Here, by using the orthogonal self-assembly based on host&#8211;guest interactions and metal-ligand interactions, we report the in situ construction of a novel POM-based hybrid supramolecular polymer (POM-SP) at the oil-water interface, while the redox and competitive responsiveness can be triggered independently. Moreover, the binding energy of POM-SP at the interface is sufficiently strong so that the assembly of POM-SP jams, allowing the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, offering the possibility of fabricating all-liquid constructs with reconfigurability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A bicyclo[1.1.0]diphosphadisilabutane radical anion salt, namely [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), has been isolated and characterized. This unique species showcases a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. What makes it particularly intriguing is the presence of an extremely rare 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron P&#8722;P &#960; bond, which exists in the absence of a supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.







Abstract
Featuring an extra electron in the &#960;* antibonding orbital, species with a 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (2c3e) &#960; bond without an underlying &#963; bond are scarcely known. Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a radical anion salt [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (i.e. [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+3&#8901;&#8722;) (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in which 3&#8901;&#8722; features a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. This species represents the first example of a Si&#8208; and P&#8208;containing analog of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. The unusual bonding motif of 3&#8901;&#8722; was thoroughly investigated via X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and calculations by density functional theory (DFT), which collectively unveiled the existence of a 2c3e &#960; bond between the bridgehead P atoms and no clearly defined supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen: Pushing the Limit of Multicentre Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the list of planar tetracoordinate atoms, the smallest element hydrogen is missing. No experimental and theoretical evidence have ever been put forwarded. Herein, we introduce the first planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom (ptH) in the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is acting like a proton and significant charge transfer from the surrounding In4 framework results in a negative charge of the central hydrogen atom. The proposed global minimum geometry possesses &#963;&#8208;aromaticity and the central hydrogen atom forms unusual multicentre bond with more than three centres.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Compared with Zn2+ storage, non&#8208;metallic charge carrier with small hydrated size and light weight shows fast dehydration and diffusion kinetics for Zn&#8722;organic batteries. Here we first report NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage in self&#8208;assembled organic superstructures (OSs) by intermolecular interactions of p&#8208;benzoquinone (BQ) and 2, 6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DQ) polymer through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. BQ&#8208;DQ OSs exhibit exposed quadruple&#8208;active carbonyl motifs and super electron delocalization routes, which are redox&#8208;exclusively coupled with high&#8208;kinetics NH4+/H+ but exclude sluggish and rigid Zn2+ ions. A unique 4e&#8722; NH4+/H+co&#8208;coordination mechanism is unravelled, giving BQ&#8208;DQ cathode high capacity (299 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current tolerance (100 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong life (50,000 cycles). This strategy further boosts the capacity to 358 mAh g&#8722;1 by modulating redox&#8208;active building units, giving new insights into ultra&#8208;fast and stable NH4+/H+ storage in organic materials for better Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Surface&#8208;Specific Spectroscopy of Water at a Photoexcited TiO2 Model Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole&#8208;mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular&#8208;level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time&#8208;resolved, surface&#8208;specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo&#8208;induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO2 in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub&#8208;20 ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH 3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H2O into Ti&#8208;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8208;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo&#8208;induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst&#8208;water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenoates are versatile building blocks which are primarily activated and controlled using chiral tert. phosphine and tert. amine Lewis bases. We herein report the first example of allenoate activation by using chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) for formal (4+2) cycloaddition reactions. Compared to established phosphine and amine catalysis, the use of these easily available Lewis bases enables new stereoselective reaction pathways proceeding with high enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, and in good yields. In addition, the factors governing enantioselectivity and the origin of the observed differences compared to other commonly used Lewis bases are explained.</dc:description>

Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain&#8208;growth Inhibitor with Three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering for Highly Dispersed Single&#8208;crystal NCM90 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC&#8208;NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C&#8208;rate performance. Here, a strategy of three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase&#8208;formation, grain&#8208;growth and phase&#8208;preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1mol% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo&#8208;doped SC&#8208;NCM(MSC&#8208;NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3 &#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo&#8208;doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+&#8208;migration preferred (1 0 4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC&#8208;NCM cubes, because of which, C&#8208;rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC&#8208;NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large&#8208;scale production of SC&#8208;NCM.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Propyne/Propylene by a Scalable Nanoporous Crystal with Confined Rotational Shutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft nanoporous crystal has been developed that can separate propyne/propylene mixtures by sieving. This occurs by the rotational movement of pyridyl rings within this framework creating a pore with a maximum size of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, thereby facilitating the adsorption of propyne while completely excluding propylene.







Abstract
Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules as a result of their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4&#8197;&#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4&#8197;&#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby leads to a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 under ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for the feasible removal of C3H4 from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.

         <title>Dearomative Insertion of Fluoroalkyl Carbenes into Azoles Leading to Fluoroalkyl Heterocycles with a Quaternary Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy was developed for the direct conversion of azoles into various heterocyclic frameworks containing fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted quaternary centers through dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
The skeletal ring expansion of heteroarenes through carbene insertion is gaining popularity in synthetic chemistry. Efficient strategies for heterocyclic ring expansion to access heterocycles containing a fluoroalkyl quaternary carbon center through fluoroalkyl carbene insertion are highly desirable because of their broad applications in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a general strategy for the dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion of azoles using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as fluoroalkyl carbene precursors, resulting in ring&#8208;expanded heterocycles in excellent yields with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. The broad generality of this methodology in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically interesting bioactive molecules and versatile transformations of the products has been demonstrated.

         <title>Acquiring Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Featured Single&#8208;Molecule Ultralong Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy for high energy level and long&#8208;lived triplet charge transfer (3CT)&#8208;featured single&#8208;molecule phosphorescence materials was proposed. Through this strategy, a robust phosphor, NIC&#8208;DMAC, was constructed with a long lifetime (&#964;3CT) exceeding 210&#8197;ms and a 3CT energy level (E3CT) as high as 2.50&#8197;eV. Thanks to its long&#8208;lived 3CT state and high E3CT, NIC&#8208;DMAC was successfully applied in photolithography as a photoinitiator and achieved double patterning.







Abstract
Although long&#8208;lived triplet charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) state with high energy level has gained significant attention, the development of organic small molecules capable of achieving such states remains a major challenge. Herein, by using the through&#8208;space electronic coupling effect, we have developed a compound, namely NIC&#8208;DMAC, which has a long&#8208;lived 3CT state at the single&#8208;molecule level with a lifetime of 210&#8197;ms and a high energy level of up to 2.50&#8197;eV. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we have elucidated the photophysical processes of NIC&#8208;DMAC, which involve sequential transitions from the first singlet excited state (S1) that shows a 1CT character to the first triplet excited state (T1) that exhibits a local excited state feature (3LE), and then to the second triplet excited state (T2) that shows a 3CT character (i.e., S1 (1CT)&#8594;T1 (3LE)&#8594;T2 (3CT)). The long lifetime and high energy level of its 3CT state have enabled NIC&#8208;DMAC as an initiator for photocuring in double patterning applications.

         <title>Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;Based Noncovalent Conformational Lock Achieves Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 24 %</title>

         <dc:description>
This work developed benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based noncovalently conformational locks for organic HTMs ZS13, which shows good charge transfer properties, thermal stability and passivation function. Perovskite solar cells using ZS13 as doped HTM yield a champion device efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% with good thermal and light stability.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with noncovalently conformational locks (OSNCs) are promising building blocks for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). However, lack of satisfied neighboring building blocks negatively impacts the optoelectronic properties of OSNCs&#8208;based HTMs and imperils the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this limitation, we introduce the benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (BTT) to construct a new OSNC, and the resulting HTM ZS13 shows improved intermolecular charge extraction/transport properties, proper energy level, efficient surface passivation effect. Consequently, the champion devices based on doped ZS13 yield an efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% and 20.95&#8201;% for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1.01&#8197;cm2, respectively. Furthermore, ZS13 shows good thermal stability and the capability of inhibiting I&#8722; ion migration, thus, leading to enhanced device stability. The success in neighboring&#8208;group engineering can triggered a strong interest in developing thienoacene&#8208;based OSNCs toward efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Amphiphilic Heterografted Molecular Bottlebrushes with Tertiary Amine&#8208;Containing Side Chains as Efficient and Robust pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular bottlebrushes with randomly grafted hydrophobic and pH&#8208;responsive polymer side chains are efficient and robust responsive emulsifiers for generation of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, which exhibit both high stability, derived from large molecular sizes and interfacial Janus structures, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The formation and disruption of emulsions were repeated 10 times, and the bottlebrushes remained intact.







Abstract
By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) and pH&#8208;responsive poly(2&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH&#8208;responsive emulsifiers. Water&#8208;in&#8208;toluene emulsions were formed at pH&#8197;4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH&#8197;10.0, PDEAEMA became water&#8208;insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de&#8208;emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.

         <title>Rational Atom Substitution to Obtain Efficient, Lead&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Perovskites Assisted by Machine Learning and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple machine learning model combined with theoretical calculations was employed to streamline optimisation and accurately identify substituents, highlighting the importance of d10 configuration in modulating Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite electronic structure. This approach seamlessly integrates with experimental validation, affirming d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ enhances Cs2AgBiBr6 photoactivity for toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Inorganic lead&#8208;free halide perovskites, devoid of toxic or rare elements, have garnered considerable attention as photocatalysts for pollution control, CO2 reduction and hydrogen production. In the extensive perovskite design space, factors like substitution or doping level profoundly impact their performance. To address this complexity, a synergistic combination of machine learning models and theoretical calculations were used to efficiently screen substitution elements that enhanced the photoactivity of substituted Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites. Machine learning models determined the importance of d10 orbitals, highlighting how substituent electron configuration affects electronic structure of Cs2AgBiBr6. Conspicuously, d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ boosted the photoactivity of Cs2AgBiBr6. Experimental verification validated these model results, revealing a 13&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic toluene conversion compared to the unsubstituted counterpart. This enhancement resulted from the small charge carrier effective mass, as well as the creation of shallow trap states, shifting the conduction band minimum, introducing electron&#8208;deficient Br, and altering the distance between the B&#8208;site cations d band centre and the halide anions p band centre, a parameter tuneable through d10 configuration substituents. This study exemplifies the application of computational modelling in photocatalyst design and elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. It underscores the potential of synergistic integration of calculations, modelling, and experimental analysis across various applications.

         <title>Photoswitchable Enantioselective and Helix&#8208;Sense Controlled Living Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric PdII/LR&#8722;azo and PdII/LS&#8722;azo could be used as reversible photo&#8208;switchable catalysts for living/controlled polymerization of isocyanide monomers. High enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense polymerization could be observed during the polymerization process.







Abstract
A pair of enantiomeric photoswitchable PdII catalysts, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo, were prepared via the coordination of alkyne&#8208;PdII and azobenzene&#8208;modified phosphine ligands LR&#8722;azo and LS&#8722;azo. Owing to the cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo exhibited different polymerization activities, helix&#8208;sense selectivities, and enantioselectivities during the polymerization of isocyanide monomers under irradiation of different wavelength lights. Furthermore, the achiral isocyanide monomer A&#8208;1 could be polymerized efficiently using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo under dark condition in a living/controlled manner. Further, it generated single right&#8208;handed helical poly&#8208;A&#8208;1m(LR&#8722;azo), confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra and atomic force microscopy images. However, the polymerization of A&#8208;1 almost could not be initiated under 420&#8197;nm light in identical conditions of dark condition. Moreover, the photoswitchable catalyst alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo exhibited high enantioselectivity for the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1, respectively. D&#8208;1 was polymerized preferentially under dark condition with a D&#8208;1/L&#8208;1 rate ratio of 70, yielding single right&#8208;handed polyisocyanides. Additionally, reversible enantioselectivity was observed under 420&#8197;nm light using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo, and the calculated polymerization rate ratio of L&#8208;1/D&#8208;1 was 57 because of the isomerization of the azobenzene moiety of the catalyst. Furthermore, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo showed opposite enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense selectivity during the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Tetramers for Efficient Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46, based on hydrogen&#8208; bonding tetramers that is self&#8208;assembled from tetrahedral building block tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) phenyl) silane was reported. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 shows highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr mixture with the highest Xe uptake and IAST selectivity among the reported HOFs up to date.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been emerging as a new type of very promising microporous materials for gas separation and purification, but few HOFs structures constructed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers have been explored in this field. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46) afforded by hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers with 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamond networks, which shows excellent chemical and thermal stability. What's more, activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 exhibits the highest xenon (Xe) uptake of 2.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and xenon/krypton (Kr) selectivity of 19.9 at the ambient condition among the reported HOFs up to date. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirmed the excellent Xe/Kr separation of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a, showing high Kr productivity (110&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Xe uptake (1.29&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as good recyclability. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the molecular simulations revealed that the abundant accessible aromatic and pyrazole rings in the pore channels of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a can provide the multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Xe interactions with Xe atoms.

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Block Copolymers: New Scission Site due to Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected mechanochemistry kinetics and selective off&#8208;center scission behavior is shown in linear block copolymers (BCPs) stressed in solution. Molecular dynamics modeling suggests a dynamic phase separation of the blocks inducing the unusual distribution of applied forces, and promoting force focusing at the interface.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry can lead to the degradation of the properties of covalent macromolecules. In recent years, numerous functional materials have been developed based on block copolymers (BCPs), however, like homopolymers, their chains could undergo mechanochemical damage during processing, which could have crucial impact on their performance. To investigate the mechanochemical response of BCPs, multiple polymers comprising different ratios of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with similar degree of polymerization and stressed in solution via ultrasonication. Interestingly, all BCPs, regardless of the amount of the methacrylate monomer, presented a mechanochemistry rate constant similar to that of the methacrylate homopolymer, while a random copolymer reacted like the acrylate homopolymer. Size&#8208;exclusion chromatography showed that, in addition to the typical main peak shift towards higher retention times, a different daughter fragment was produced indicating a secondary selective scission site, situated around the covalent connection between the two blocks. Molecular dynamics modeling using acrylate and methacrylate oligomers were carried out and indicated that dynamic phase separation occurs even in a good solvent. Such non&#8208;random conformations can explain the faster polymer mechanochemistry. Moreover, the dynamic model for end&#8208;to&#8208;end chain overstretching supports bond scission which is not necessarily chain&#8208;centered.

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ tracking of ion transport kinetics under nanoconfinement was achieved by transient single&#8208;particle imaging method. The results implied that the ion transport kinetics in long nanochannels is dominated by the in&#8208;pore diffusion, while in short nanopores/nanochannels is governed by electrical double layer (EDL) formation. The local ion accumulation within EDL changes the ion mobility and then affects the apparent ion transport kinetics.







Abstract
The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.

         <title>Sculpting Mesoscopic Helical Chirality into Covalent Organic Framework Nanotubes from Entirely Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diversification of chirality in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) holds immense promise for expanding their properties and functionality. Herein, we introduce an innovative approach for imparting helical chirality to COFs and fabricating a family of chiral COF nanotubes with mesoscopic helicity from entirely achiral building blocks for the first time. We present an effective 2,3&#8208;diaminopyridine&#8208;mediated supramolecular templating method, which facilitates the prefabrication of helical imine&#8208;linked polymer nanotubes using unprecedented achiral symmetric monomers. Through meticulous optimization of crystallization conditions, these helical polymer nanotubes are adeptly converted into imine&#8208;linked COF nanotubes boasting impressive surface areas, while well preserving their helical morphology and chiroptical properties. Furthermore, these helical imine&#8208;linked polymers or COFs could be subtly transformed into corresponding more stable and functional helical &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked and hydrazone&#8208;linked COF nanotubes with transferred circular dichroism via monomer exchange. Notably, despite the involvement of covalent bonding breakage and reorganization, these exchange processes overcome thermodynamic disadvantages, allowing mesoscopic helical chirality to be perfectly preserved. This research highlights the potential of mesoscopic helicity in conferring COFs with favourable chiral properties, providing novel insights into the development of multifunctional COFs in the field of chiral materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Component Dual Donor Enables Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Co&#8208;release of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single&#8208;component ultrasound&#8208;responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.







Abstract
The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report an ultrasound&#8208;responsive water&#8208;soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on single&#8208;component sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co&#8208;release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Electrochemistry at Electrodes with Dimensions Commensurable and Smaller than Individual Reacting Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical electrodes made with atomic&#8208;scale precision enable the exploration of angstroms&#8208;scale electrochemistry. Unique features including size effects of reacting species and surface blockade behavior due to the strong species&#8208;electrodes interactions are found dominating electrochemistry at the smallest possible scale.







Abstract
In nature and technologies, many chemical reactions occur at interfaces with dimensions approaching that of a single reacting species in nano&#8208; and angstrom&#8208;scale. Mechanisms governing reactions at this ultimately small spatial regime remain poorly explored because of challenges to controllably fabricate required devices and assess their performance in experiment. Here we report how efficiency of electrochemical reactions evolves for electrodes that range from just one atom in thickness to sizes comparable with and exceeding hydration diameters of reactant species. The electrodes are made by encapsulating graphene and its multilayers within insulating crystals so that only graphene edges remain exposed and partake in reactions. We find that limiting current densities characterizing electrochemical reactions exhibit a pronounced size effect if reactant's hydration diameter becomes commensurable with electrodes&#8217; thickness. An unexpected blockade effect is further revealed from electrodes smaller than reactants, where incoming reactants are blocked by those adsorbed temporarily at the atomically narrow interfaces. The demonstrated angstrom&#8208;scale electrochemistry offers a venue for studies of interfacial behaviors at the true molecular scale.

         <title>Growth of Merocyanine Dye J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets by Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a new amphiphilic merocyanine dye has been investigated in an aqueous solvent mixture. Two supramolecular polymorphs were observed: The first polymorph is an off&#8208;pathway H&#8208;type nanoparticle (Agg1) and the second is a thermodynamic J&#8208;aggregate nanosheet (Agg2). A seeded living supramolecular polymerization was utilized to accelerate the transformation from metastable nanoparticles into two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates are highly desired dye aggregates but so far there has been no general concept how to accomplish the required slip&#8208;stacked packing arrangement for dipolar merocyanine (MC) dyes whose aggregation commonly affords one&#8208;dimensional aggregates composed of antiparallel, co&#8208;facially stacked MCs with H&#8208;type coupling. Herein we describe a strategy for MC J&#8208;aggregates based on our results for an amphiphilic MC dye bearing alkyl and oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. In an aqueous solvent mixture, we observe the formation of two supramolecular polymorphs for this MC dye, a metastable off&#8208;pathway nanoparticle showing H&#8208;type coupling and a thermodynamically favored nanosheet showing J&#8208;type coupling. Detailed studies concerning the self&#8208;assembly mechanism by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and the packing structure by atomic force microscopy and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering show how the packing arrangement of such amphiphilic MC dyes can afford slip&#8208;stacked two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets whose macrodipole is compensated by the formation of a bilayer structure. As an additional feature we demonstrate how the size of the nanosheets can be controlled by seeded living supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Accelerated Electrophotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Heteroarylation Enabled by an Efficient Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable flow reactor for electrophotocatalysis is presented. The reactor can simultaneously exploit photons and electrons. The efficacy of this reactor was demonstrated in a novel electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalytic transformations are garnering attention in organic synthesis, particularly for accessing reactive intermediates under mild conditions. Moving these methodologies to continuous&#8208;flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (f&#8208;EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost&#8208;effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.

         <title>Cobalt Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Substrate Specificity and Mechanistic Variability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation finds widespread application in academia and industry. And indeed, a number of processes have been implemented for the production of pharma and agro intermediates as well as flavors &amp; fragrances. Although these processes are all based on the use of late transition metals as catalysts, there is an increasing interest in the use of base metal catalysis in view of their lower cost and the expected different substrate scope. Catalysts based on cobalt have already shown their potential in enantioselective hydrogenation chemistry. This review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years on cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of different unsaturated substrates. We also illustrate the ligand dependent substrate specificity as well as the mechanistic variability in detail. This may well guide further catalyst development in this research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Protein Crosstalk with a Molecule that Exchanges Binding Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drawing inspiration from allosteric signaling enzymes, whose catalytic and regulatory units are non&#8208;covalently linked, we have devised a method to establish unnatural, effector&#8208;mediated enzyme activation within native cells. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by introducing a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) onto glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) through non&#8208;covalent means. Our study reveals that this synthetic regulator mediates an unnatural crosstalk between GSK&#8208;3 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), whose expression is regulated by cellular oxygen levels. Specifically, with this approach, the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 is transformed into an activable enzyme, whereas LDHA is repurposed as an unnatural effector protein that controls the activity of the kinase, making it unnaturally dependent on the cell's hypoxic response. These findings demonstrate a step toward imitating the function of effector&#8208;regulated cell&#8208;signaling enzymes, which play a key biological role in mediating the response of cells to changes in their environment. In addition, at the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle level, our results indicate the potential to develop a new class of protein inhibitors whose inhibitory effect in cells is dictated by the cell's environment and consequent protein expression profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Corner Engineering: Tailoring Enzymes for Enhanced Resistance and Thermostability in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), heralded for their synthesis simplicity, economic viability, and reduced volatility and flammability, have found increasing application in biocatalysis. However, challenges persist due to a frequent diminution in enzyme activity and stability. Herein, we developed a general protein engineering strategy, termed corner engineering, to acquire DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes via precisely tailoring of the transition region in enzyme structure. Employing Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA) as a model, we delineated the engineering process, yielding five multi&#8208;DESs resistant variants with highly improved thermostability, such as K889E/N89K exhibited up to a 10.0&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) increase in 30% (v/v) ChCl:acetamide and 4.1&#8208;fold in 95% (v/v) ChCl:ethylene glycol accompanying 6.7&#8208;fold thermal resistance improvement than wild type at ~50 &#176;C. The generality of the optimized approach was validated by two extra industrial enzymes, endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucanase PvCel5A (used for biofuel production) and esterase Bs2Est (plastics degradation).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), heralded for their synthesis simplicity, economic viability, and reduced volatility and flammability, have found increasing application in biocatalysis. However, challenges persist due to a frequent diminution in enzyme activity and stability. Herein, we developed a general protein engineering strategy, termed corner engineering, to acquire DES-resistant and thermostable enzymes via precisely tailoring of the transition region in enzyme structure. Employing Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA) as a model, we delineated the engineering process, yielding five multi-DESs resistant variants with highly improved thermostability, such as K889E/N89K exhibited up to a 10.0-fold catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) increase in 30% (v/v) ChCl:acetamide and 4.1-fold in 95% (v/v) ChCl:ethylene glycol accompanying 6.7-fold thermal resistance improvement than wild type at ~50 &#176;C. The generality of the optimized approach was validated by two extra industrial enzymes, endo-&#946;-1,4-glucanase PvCel5A (used for biofuel production) and esterase Bs2Est (plastics degradation). The molecular investigations revealed that increased water molecules at substrate binding sites and finetuned helix formation at the corner region are two dominant determinants governing elevated resistance and thermostability. This study, coupling corner engineering with obtained molecular insights, illuminates enzyme-DES interaction patterns and fosters the rational design of more DES-resistant and thermostable enzymes in biocatalysis and biotransformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanocomposites for Amplified Theranostics of Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bone metastasis is a type of metastatic tumors that involves the spreads of malignant tumor cells into skeleton, and its diagnosis and treatment remain a big challenge due to the unique tumor microenvironment. We herein develop osteoclast and tumor cell dual&#8208;targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposites (SPFeNOC) for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. SPFeNOC contain semiconducting polymer and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles inside core and surface camouflaged hybrid membrane of cancer cells and osteoclasts. The hybrid membrane camouflage enables their targeting to both metastatic tumor cells and osteoclasts in bone metastasis through homologous targeting mechanism, thus achieving an enhanced nanoparticle accumulation in tumors. The semiconducting polymer mediates near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are used for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Because both cancer cells and osteoclasts are killed synchronously via the combinational action of SDT and CDT, the vicious cycle in bone metastasis is broken to realize high antitumor efficacy. Therefore, 4T1 breast cancer&#8208;based bone metastasis can be effectively detected and cured by using SPFeNOC as dual&#8208;targeting theranostic nanoagents. This study provides an unusual biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously targets osteoclasts and cancer cells for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Scintillators for X&#8208;Ray Imaging Through Host&#8211;Guest Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demands of X&#8208;ray detection and medical diagnosis, organic scintillators with intense and tunable X&#8208;ray excited emission have been becoming important. To guarantee the X&#8208;ray absorption, heavy atoms were widely added in reported organic scintillators, which led to emission quenching. In this work, we propose a new strategy to realize organic scintillators&#160;through the host&#8208;guest doping strategy. Then the X&#8208;ray absorption centers (host) and emission centers (guest) are separated. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, these materials displayed intense and readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520 nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8201;nm). Besides, the relationship between the X&#8208;ray absorption and spatial arrangement of the heavy atoms in the host matrix was also revealed. The potential application of these wide&#8208;range color tunable organic host&#8208;guest scintillators in X&#8208;ray imaging were demonstrated. This work provides a new feasible strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic scintillators with tunable luminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Double Helices from &#947;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is ubiquitous in nature, and homochirality is manifested in many biomolecules. Although &#946;&#8208;double helices are rare in peptides and proteins, they consist of alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids. No peptide double helices with homochiral amino acids have been observed. Here, we report chiral &#946;&#8208;double helices constructed from &#947;&#8208;peptides consisting of alternating achiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 4,4&#8208;dimethyl &#947;&#8208;amino acids and chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids in both single crystals and in solution. The two independent strands of the same peptide intertwine to form a &#946;&#8208;double helix structure, and it is stabilized by inter&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds. The peptides with chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;amino acids adopt a (P)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix, whereas peptides consisting of (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;amino acids adopt an (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix conformation. The circular dichroism (CD) signature of (P) and (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helices and the stability of these peptides at higher temperatures were examined. Furthermore, ion transport studies suggested that these peptides transport ions across membranes. Even though the structural analogy suggests that these new &#946;&#8208;double helices are structurally different from those of the &#945;&#8208;peptide &#946;&#8208;double helices, they retain ion transport activity. The results reported here may open new avenues in the design of functional foldamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonium Cation in the Service of &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While still rare, cationic ligands offer much promise as tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands for &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. Recently, we introduced pincer&#8208;type sulfonium cations into the list of available strongly &#960;&#8208;acidic ancillary ligands. However, the M&#8208;S bond in sulfonium complexes of these ligands was found highly labile, precluding their catalytic applications. Herein we demonstrate that this obstacle can be overcome by increasing the rigidity of the sulfonium pincer scaffold. X&#8208;ray analyses confirm that despite bearing a formal positive charge, the sulfur atom of this newly designed sulfonium ligand maintains its coordination to the Pt(II)&#8208;center, while DFT calculations indicate that by doing so it strongly enhances the electrophilic character of the metal. Kinetic studies carried out on three model cycloisomerization reactions prove that such a&#160;tris&#8208;cationic sulfonium&#8208;Pt(II) complex is highly reactive, compared to its thioether&#8208;based analogue. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study presents the first example of employing sulfonium&#8208;based ligands in homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Shearing Liquid&#8208;Crystalline MXene into Lamellar Membranes with Super&#8208;Aligned Nanochannels for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned slit&#8208;shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly&#8208;ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ separation (~45, ~49, and ~59), combined with a fast Li+ transport with a permeation rate of ~0.35 mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li+ with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li+ and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li+ through the super&#8208;aligned MXene channels. This work demonstrates the capability of MXene membranes in monovalent ion separation, which also provides a facile and general strategy to fabricate lamellar membranes in a large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2: A New Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material Derived from KBe2BO3F2 with High Performance and Excellent Water&#8208;Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acquiring high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that simultaneously exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients, as short as possible SHG phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and non&#8208;hygroscopic properties has consistently posed a significant challenge. Herein, through multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), an excellent UV NLO crystal, Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2, was successfully synthesized in malonic system. This material possesses a unique 2D NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064 nm) and short PM wavelength of 200 nm. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional water resistance, which is rare among ionic organic NLO crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that its excellent water&#8208;resistant may be originated from its small available cavity volumes, which is similar to the famous LiB3O5 (LBO). Therefore, excellent NLO properties and stability against air and moisture indicate it should be a promising UV NLO crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending Ring&#8208;Chain Coupling Empirical Law to Lithium&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) holds promise for replacing Haber&#8208;Bosch process and realizing sustainable and green ammonia production. However, the general interface problem in lithium electrochemistry seriously impedes the further enhancement of LMNRR performance. Inspired by the development history of lithium battery electrolytes, here, we extend the ring&#8208;chain solvents coupling law to LMNRR system to rationally optimize the interface during the reaction process, achieving nearly a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency up to 54.78&#177;1.60%. Systematic theoretical simulations and experimental analysis jointly decipher that the anion&#8208;rich Li+ solvation structure derived from ring tetrahydrofuran coupling with chain ether successfully suppresses the excessive passivation of electrolyte decomposition at the reaction interface, thus promoting the mass transfer of active species and enhancing the nitrogen fixation kinetics. This work offers a progressive insight into the electrolyte design of LMNRR system.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly &#8211; Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasiperiodic patterns and crystals &#8208; having long range order without translational symmetry &#8208; fascinate researchers since their discovery. In this study, we report on new p&#8208;terphenyl based T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles with two alkyl end&#8208;chains and a glycerol&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded side&#8208;group, self&#8208;assembling into an aperiodic columnar liquid quasicrystal with 12&#8208;fold symmetry and its periodic liquid&#8208;crystalline approximants with complex superstructures. All represent honeycombs formed by self&#8208;assembly of the p&#8208;terphenyls, dividing space into prismatic cells with polygonal cross&#8208;sections. In the perspective of tiling patterns, the presence of unique trapezoidal tiles, consisting of three rigid sides formed by the p&#8208;terphenyls and one shorter, incommensurate, and adjustable side by the alkyl end&#8208;chains, plays a crucial role for these phases. A delicate temperature&#8208;dependent balance between conformational, entropic and space filling effects determines the role of the alkyl chains, either as network nodes or trapezoid walls, thus resulting in the order&#8208;disorder transitions associated with emergence of quasiperiodicity. In&#8208;depth analysis suggests a change from a quasiperiodic tiling involving trapezoids to a modified one with a contribution of trapezoid pair fusion. This work paves the way for understanding quasiperiodicity emergence and develops fundamental concepts for its generation by chemical design of non&#8208;spherical molecules, aggregates and frameworks based on reticular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Structurally Labile Peptide Nanosheets After Molecular Functionalization of the Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant challenge in creating supramolecular materials is that conjugating molecular functionalities to building blocks often results in dissociation or undesired morphological transformation of their assemblies. Here we present a facile strategy to preserve structurally labile peptide assemblies after molecular modification of the self&#8208;assembling peptides. Sheet&#8208;forming peptides are designed to afford a staggered alignment with the segments bearing chemical modification sites protruding from the sheet surfaces. The staggered assembly allows for simultaneous separation of attached molecules from each other and from the underlying assembly motifs. Strikingly, using PEGs as the external molecules, PEG400&#8208; and PEG700&#8208;peptide conjugates directly self&#8208;associate into nanosheets with the PEG chains localized on the sheet surfaces. In contrast, the sheet formation based on in&#8208;register lateral packing of peptides does not recur upon the peptide PEGylation. This strategy allows for fabrication of densely modified assemblies with a variety of molecules, as demonstrated using biotin (hydrophobic molecule), c(RGDfK) (cyclic pentapeptide), and nucleic acid aptamer (negatively charged ssDNA). The staggered co&#8208;assembly also enables extended tunability of the amount/density of surface molecules, as exemplified by screening ligand&#8208;appended assemblies for cell targeting. This study paves the way for functionalization of historically challenging fragile assemblies while maintaining their overall morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reversible Complexation Mediated Polymerization (RCMP) from Benzylic Alcohols for Facile Access to Polymer&#8208;Grafted Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot synthesis of methacrylic and acrylic polymers from benzylic alcohols (R&#8722;OH) used as initiating moieties was developed. R&#8722;OH was converted to alkyl iodide (R&#8722;I), and the generated R&#8722;I was used as an initiator without purification or isolation in the subsequent reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), leading to one&#8208;pot RCMP from R&#8722;OH. As a useful application, this technique was exploited for one&#8208;pot polymer&#8208;grafting from lignin that is the second most abundant renewable carbon&#8208;source on earth and bears benzylic alcohols. The direct initiation from lignin eliminates tedious initiator attachment and purification, offering a facile access to polymer&#8208;grafted lignin. The obtained polymer&#8208;grafted lignin was utilized to form an efficient UV&#8208;absorbing film with high transparency in visible region. One&#8208;pot RCMP may serve as a practical method to obtain value&#8208;added functional lignin&#8208;polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene with a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;doped cavities are pervasive in graphenic materials, and represent key sites for catalytic and electrochemical activity. However, their structures are generally heterogeneous. In this study, we present the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined molecular cutout of graphene featuring N&#8208;doped cavity. The graphitization of a macrocyclic pyridinic precursor was achieved through photochemical cyclodehydrochlorination. In comparison to its counterpart with pyridinic nitrogen at the edges, the pyridinic nitrogen atoms in this nanographene cavity exhibit significantly reduced basicity&#160;and selective binding to Ag+ ion. Analysis of the protonation and coordination equilibria revealed that the tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped cavity binds three protons, but only one Ag+ ion. These distinct protonation and coordination behaviors clearly illustrate the space confinement effect imparted by the cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Defect Engineering Synergistically Boost High Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency of Cerium oxide/Au Hollow Nanomushrooms for Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation using solar illumination under ambient conditions is a promising strategy for production of the indispensable chemical NH3.    However, due to the catalyst's limitations in solar energy utilization, loss of hot electrons during transfer, and low nitrogen adsorption and activation capacity, the unsatisfactory solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiencies of most photocatalysts limit their practical applications.   Herein, cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (denoted cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au). Plasmonic Au extended the absorption of light from the visible to the second near&#8208;infrared region. The superior interface greatly enhanced the transfer efficiency of hot electrons. Abundant strain&#8208;VO defects induced by interfacial compressive strain promoted adsorption and in situ activation of nitrogen, and such synergistic promotion of strain and VO defects was further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The judicious structural and defect engineering co&#8208;promoted the efficient nitrogen photofixation of the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au heterostructures with a SCC efficiency of 0.1% under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, which is comparable to the average solar&#8208;to&#8208;biomass conversion efficiency of natural photosynthesis by typical plants, thus exhibiting significant potential as a new candidate for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Luminescent Chiral Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Clusters via Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the ubiquity of chirality in nature, chiral self&#8208;assembly involving self&#8208;sorting behaviors has remained as one of the most important research topics of interests. Herein, starting from a racemic mixture of SEG&#8208;based (SEG = SEGPHOS) chlorogold(I) precursors, a unique chiral butterfly&#8208;shape hexadecanuclear gold(I) cluster (Au16) with different ratios of RSEG and SSEG ligands is obtained via homoleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting. More interestingly, by employing different chlorogold(I) precursors of opposite chirality (such as RSEG&#8208;Au2 and SBIN&#8208;Au2), an unprecedented heteroleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting strategy has been developed to give a series of heteroleptic chiral decanuclear gold(I) clusters (Au10) with propellor&#8208;shape structures. Heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting have also been observed between enantiomers of homoleptic chiral Au10 clusters to result in the heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters via cluster&#8208;to&#8208;cluster transformation. Incorporation of heteroleptic ligands is found to decrease the symmetry from S4 of homoleptic meso Au10 to C2 of heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters. The chirality has been transferred from the axial chiral ligands and stored in the heteroleptic gold(I) clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Strategy Towards Symmetry Breaking of Boron&#8208;centered Tetrahedron for Poly&#8208;fluorinated Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borate crystals can be chemically and functionally modified by fluorination strategy, which encourages the identification of emerging fluorooxoborates with a structure and set of characteristics not seen in any other oxide parents. However, the bulk of fluorooxoborates have been found accidentally, rational methods of synthesis are required, particularly for the infrequently occurring poly&#8208;fluorinated components. Herein, we reported the use of bifluoride salts as a potent source of fluorine to prepare fluorooxoborates that contain rarely tri&#8208;fluorinated [BF3X] (X = O and CH3) tetrahedra and eleven compounds were found. We identified the optical properties of the organofluorinated group [CH3BF3] and their potential for nonlinear optics for the first time. Among these, two non&#8208;centrosymmetric components hold potential for the production of 266 nm harmonic coherent light for nonlinear optics, and more crucially, have the benefit of growing large size single crystals. Our study establishes experimental conditions for the coexistence of the diverse functional groups, enabling the production of poly&#8208;fluorinated optical crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bridged Benzazepines via Photo&#8208;Induced Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bridged benzazepine scaffolds, possessing unique structural and physicochemical activities, are widespread in various natural products and drugs. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Herein, we develop a simple and divergent approach for constructing various bridged benzazepines by a photocatalytic intermolecular dearomatization of naphthalene derivatives with readily available &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The bridged motif is created via a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroaminoalkylation, alkene isomerization and cyclization. Interestingly, the diastereoselectivity can be regulated through different reaction modes in the cyclization step. Moreover, aminohydroxylation and its further bromination have also been demonstrated to access highly functionalized bridged benzazepines. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to get insights into the mechanism. This method provides a divergent synthetic approach for construction of highly functionalized bridged benzazepines, which have been otherwise difficult to access.</dc:description>

         <title>New Reaction Pathway of Superoxide Disproportionation Induced by a Soluble Catalyst in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery has attracted considerable interest for high theoretical energy density, however the disproportionation of the intermediate of superoxide (O2&#8208;) during discharge and charge leads to slow reaction kinetics and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, the chemically stable ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations are employed as a soluble catalyst to alternate the pathway of O2&#8208; disproportionation and its kinetics in both the discharge and charge processes. RB captures O2&#8208; dimer and promotes their intramolecular charge transfer, and it decreases the energy barrier of the disproportionation reaction from 7.70 to 0.70 kcal mol&#8208;1. This facilitates the discharge and charge processes and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8208; and singlet oxygen related side reactions. These endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.72 V and prolonged lifespan for over 230 cycles when coupled with RuO2 catalyst. This work highlights the vital role of superoxide disproportionation for Li&#8208;O2 battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Hot or Not? &#8211; Reassessing Mechanisms of Photocurrent Generation in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is now widely accepted that certain effects arising from localised surface plasmon resonance, such as enhanced electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, and thermal effects, can facilitate electrocatalytic processes. This newly emerging field of research is commonly referred to as plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC) and is attracting increasing interest from the research community, particularly regarding harnessing the high energy of hot carriers. However, this has led to a lack of critical analysis in the literature, where the participation of hot carriers is routinely claimed due to their perceived desirability, while the contribution of other effects is often not sufficiently investigated. As a result, correctly differentiating between the possible mechanisms at play has become a key point of contention. In this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms behind photocurrents observed in PEEC and critically evaluate the possibility of alternative sources of current enhancement in the reported PEEC systems. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the best experimental practices and methods to distinguish between the various enhancement mechanisms in PEEC.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;mediated polymerization catalyzed by carbon nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanomaterials, specifically carbon dots and carbon nitrides, play a crucial role as heterogeneous photoinitiators in both radical and cationic polymerization processes. These recently introduced materials offer promising solutions to the limitations of current homogeneous systems, presenting a novel approach to photopolymerization.

         <title>A Dual Anion Chemistry&#8208;Based Superionic Glass Enabling Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy Na&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolytes (GNSSEs) are an important group of amorphous SSEs. However, the insufficient ionic conductivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GNSSEs at room temperature lessens their promise in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASSNIBs) with high energy density and improved safety. Here we report the discovery of a new sodium superionic glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 (NTOC), based on dual&#8208;anion sublattice of oxychlorides. The unique local structures with abundant bridging and non&#8208;bridging oxygen atoms contribute&#160;to a highly disordered Na&#8208;ion distribution as well as low Na+ migration barrier within NTOC, enabling an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.62 mS cm&#8208;1 at 25&#8451; (more than 20 times higher than those of previously reported GNSSEs). Moreover, the excellent formability of glassy NTOC electrolyte and its high electrochemical oxidative stability ensure a favourable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, contributing to superior cycling stability of ASSNIBs for over 500 cycles at room temperature. The discovery of glassy NTOC electrolyte would reignite research enthusiasm in superionic glassy SSEs based on multi&#8208;anion chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal catalysed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. Using a semi&#8208;rational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression systemBrocoli. Pd&#8208;catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved using Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#160;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bioorthogonal functionalization and conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Dynamics and Modular Peripheral Binding in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 3:2 Host:Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Now that the chemistry of 1:1 host:guest complexes is well&#8208;established, it is surprising to note that higher stoichiometry (oligomeric) complexes, especially those with excess host, remain largely unexplored. Yet, proteins tend to oligomerize, affording new functions for cell machinery. Here, we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles combined with symmetric, linear di&#8208;viologens form unusual 3:2 host:guest complexes exhibiting remarkable dynamic properties, host self&#8208;sorting, and external ring&#8208;translocation. These results highlight the structural tunability of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) based 3:2 host:guest complexes in water and their responsiveness toward several stimuli (chemicals, pH, redox).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free B&#8208;B Dehydrocoupling Reaction of a Simple Borane Adduct: Convenient Access to a Nucleophilic Diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective formation of homonuclear bonds is of key importance in synthetic chemistry. Especially, dehydrocoupling reactions are attractive as ecologically and economically friendly alternatives to established reductive bond forming reactions, since they do not require the use of stoichiometric amounts of a reducing reagent and produce only valuable dihydrogen as by&#8208;product. Here, we report on a metal&#8208;free B&#8208;B dehydrocoupling reaction that starts directly from a simple, easily accessible BH3 adduct, providing convenient access to a new nucleophilic dihydrodiborane in excellent yield. The dihydrodiborane in turn activates dihydrogen, allowing to obtain quantitatively the dideuteridodiborane from the dihydridodiborane by D2 activation. On the basis of detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the mechanism of this unprecedented reaction is elucidated. Some key points that are essential for metal&#8208;free dehydrocoupling are disclosed, paving the way for their systematic evaluation and application.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Synthesis of Nanostructured Conductive MOFs from Insulating MOF Precursors for Supercapacitors and Chemiresistive Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as unique layer&#8208;stacked crystalline coordination polymers that simultaneously possess porous and conductive properties. However, the controlled synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs with high crystallinity and customized morphologies is essential for energy and electronic devices, which remains a great challenge. Herein, we present a template strategy to synthesize 12 different 2D c&#8208;MOFs with controlled morphologies and dimensions via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. The resultant hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature intrinsic electrical conductivity (up to 102 S cm&#8208;1) and higher surface areas (up to ~62 times) than the reported bulk&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;MOFs, which are beneficial for improved access to active sites and enhanced mass transport. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications, the resultant hollow Cu&#8208;BHT nanocube&#8208;based supercapacitor exhibits over 2.3&#8208;fold improvement in specific capacity (364.5 F g&#8208;1) in organic electrolyte than the bulk&#8208;type Cu&#8208;BHT (161.9 F g&#8208;1), surpassing the reported MOF&#8208;based electrodes (up to 202 F g&#8208;1). In addition, the Cu&#8208;HHB nanoflower&#8208;based chemiresistive gas sensor displays over 2.5&#8208;fold enhancement in response intensity toward H2S compared to bulk&#8208;type Cu&#8208;HHB, boasting the fastest response speed and one of the lowest limits of detection ever reported for H2S sensors at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Structural Activity Screening of &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Assemblies with High&#8208;Throughput Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>

         <dc:description>Embracing complexity in design, metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly presents an opportunity for fabricating materials of economic significance. The array of accessible supramolecules is alluring, along with favourable energy requirements. Implementation is hampered by an inability to efficiently characterise complex mixtures. The stoichiometry, size, shape, guest binding properties and reactivity of individual components and combinations thereof are inherently challenging to resolve. A large combinatorial library of four transition metals (Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn), six &#946;&#8208;diketonate ligands at different molar ratios and pH was robotically prepared and directly analysed over multiple timepoints with electrospray ionisation travelling wave ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. The dataset was parsed for self&#8208;assembling activity without first attempting to structurally assign individual species. Self&#8208;assembling systems were readily categorised without manual data&#8208;handling, allowing efficient screening of self&#8208;assembly activity. This workflow clarifies solution phase supramolecular assembly processes without manual, bottom&#8208;up processing. The complex behaviour of the self&#8208;assembling systems was reduced to simpler qualities, which could be automatically processed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic materials depleted of heavy stable isotopes are known to deviate strongly in some physicochemical properties from their isotopically natural counterparts.&#160; Here we explored for the first time the effect of simultaneous depletion of the heavy carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes on the bacterium E. coli and the enzymes expressed in it. Bacteria showed faster growth, with most proteins exhibiting higher thermal stability, while for recombinant enzymes expressed in depleted media, faster kinetics was discovered.&#160; At room temperature, luciferase, thioredoxin and dihydrofolate reductase and Pfu DNA polymerase showed up to a 250% increase in activity compared to the native counterparts, with an additional ~50% increase at 10 &#176;C. Diminished conformational and vibrational entropy is hypothesized to be the cause of the accelerated kinetics. Ultralight enzymes may find an application where extreme reaction rates are required.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Cluster Expansion at a Zintl Cluster Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the tris&#8208;hypersilyl nonagermanide Zintl cluster salt, K[Ge9(Hyp)3] (Hyp = Si(SiMe3)3) with [Rh(&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;L)Cl]2 (L = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, COD; norbornadiene, NBD) afforded eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex homo&#8208;multimetallic clusters by cluster core expansion. Using a stepwise procedure, starting from the Zintl cluster [Rh(COD){Ge9(Hyp)3}] and [Ir(COD)Cl]2, this methodology was expanded for the synthesis of eleven&#8208;vertex hetero&#8208;multimetallic clusters. A mechanism for the formation of these first examples of closo eleven&#8208;vertex Zintl clusters is proposed, informed by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Luminescent Phenothiazinyl Merocyanine Substituted Polyacetylenes</title>

         <dc:description>A new generation of soluble phenothiazinyl merocyanine substituted polyacetylenes can be readily synthesized by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of the corresponding 3&#8208;ethynyl phenothiazines, accessible by Sonogashira coupling and Knoevenagel condensation. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy of 7&#8208;acceptor&#8208;substituted phenothiazinyl polyacetylenes reveal that these polyacetylenes with conjugatively ligated merocyanines are luminescent in solution with positive emission solvatochromism and, in some cases, with distinct solid&#8208;state luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating&#160;Host Design and Tailored&#160;Electronic Effects of Yolk&#8208;Shell Zn&#8208;Mn Diatomic&#160;Sites for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the surface and spatial structure of the host is associated with the reactivity of the active site, and also enhances the mass transfer effect of the CO2 electroreduction process (CO2RR). Here, we develop two&#8208;step ligand etch&#8208;pyrolysis to access an asymmetric dual atomic&#8208;site catalyst&#160;(DASC) composed of S,&#160;N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8208;Mn dimer anchored on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) derived yolk&#8208;shell carbon framework (Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC), with high accessibility. In Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC,&#160;the electronic effects of S/N&#8208;Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;S/N configuration are tailored by strong interactions between Zn&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;sites and co&#8208;coordinating with S/N atoms, rendering structural stability and atomic distribution. In H&#8208;cell, the Zn1Mn1&#8208;SNC DASC shows low onset overpotential of 50 mV and high CO Faraday efficiency of 97% with low applied overpotential of 343 mV, which outperforms the properties of counterparts, and in flow&#8208;cell, it also reaches high current density of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.85 V benefit by the high structure accessibility and active dual&#8208;site. Density functional theory&#160;simulations interpret that the S, N&#8208;coordinated Zn&#8208;Mn diatomic site with optimal adsorption strength of COOH* lowers the reaction energy barrier, thus&#160;boosting the intrinsic CO2RR activity on DASC. This work illustrates the structure&#8208;property correlation, giving new ideas to the development of highly accessible atomic catalysts for facilitating practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ru Symmetry of a RuO2&#160;Catalyst for Sustainable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a highly promising hydrogen production technique for sustainable energy supply, however, achieving a highly active and durable catalyst for acidic water oxidation still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a local microenvironment regulation strategy for precisely tuning In&#8208;RuO2/graphene (In&#8208;RuO2/G) catalyst with remarkably intrinsic electrochemical activity and stability to boost acidic water oxidation. The In&#8208;RuO2/G displays robust acid oxygen evolution reaction performance with a mass activity of 671 A gcat&#8722;1 at 1.5 V, an overpotential of 187 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;lasting stability of 350 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, which arises from the asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;In local structure interactions. Further, it is unraveled theoretically that the asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;In structure breaks the thermodynamic activity limit of the traditional adsorption evolution mechanism which significantly weakens the formation energy barrier of OOH*, thus inducing a new rate&#8208;determining step of *OH absorption. Therefore, this strategy showcases the immense potential for constructing high&#8208;performance acidic catalysts for water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective method to remove the surface ligand from Pd nanosheets by simply aging the sample in ethanol at room temperature. This slow process allows for atomic reconstruction without altering the sheet morphology. When exposed to e&#8208;beam irradiation or working as an electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation, the aged Pd nanosheets show enhanced stability.







Abstract
Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93&#177;0.17&#8197;nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both e&#8208;beam irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., ethanol oxidation). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.

         <title>Molecularly generated light and its biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it possible that light can be formulated as capsules, injection solutions, and packed into polymers? Yes, if the light is generated from molecules. The concept of &#8220;molecular light&#8221; has the potential to significantly expand our perspectives on the potential applications of light.







Abstract
Molecularly generated light, referred to here as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, mainly includes bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and Cerenkov luminescence. Molecular light possesses unique dual features of being both a molecule and a source of light. Its molecular nature enables it to be delivered as molecules to regions deep within the body, overcoming the limitations of natural sunlight and physically generated light sources like lasers and LEDs. Simultaneously, its light properties make it valuable for applications such as imaging, photodynamic therapy, photo&#8208;oxidative therapy, and photobiomodulation. In this review article, we provide an updated overview of the diverse applications of molecular light and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of molecular light across various domains. Lastly, we present forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the potential of molecular light in the realms of molecular imaging, photobiological mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and photobiomodulation. While some of these perspectives may be considered bold and contentious, our intent is to inspire further innovations in the field of molecular light applications.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy has been developed to enable visible&#8208;light excited ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP). The multi&#8208;esterification strategy boosts transition dipole moments, leading to the most efficient UL&#8208;RTP in flexible films upon excitation with blue light, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in time&#8208;delayed white LEDs and flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.







Abstract
The development of ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in processable amorphous organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient UL&#8208;RTP from amorphous materials remains a challenging task, especially with activation by visible light and a bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification of a rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes the aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a &#8242;four birds with one stone&#8242; possibility in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light through enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from a significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing the intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light&#8208;stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01&#8197;s and efficiency up to 35.4&#8201;% upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm) in flexible films using multi&#8208;esterified coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and information technology based on flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.

         <title>Direct Quantification of Nanoplastics Neurotoxicity by Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PS nanoplastics&#8208;induced reductions in exocytotic activity have been quantified by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggested that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of F&#8208;actin assemblies. This research provides key hints for deciphering how nanoplastics affect neurotransmitter secretion and neural functions.







Abstract
Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers the first direct evidence for the nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane&#8208;vesicle fusion pore opening&#8208;closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F&#8208;actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis. Our finding shapes the first quantitative picture of neurotoxicity induced by high&#8208;concentration nanoplastics exposure at a single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Mobility&#8208;Modulated Sequential Dissociation Analysis Enables Structural Lipidomics in Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.







Abstract
Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure&#8208;resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis.

&lt;p&gt;A mobility-modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure-resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis. Here, we report a mobility-modulated sequential dissociation (MMSD) strategy for multiplex MS/MS imaging of distinct lipids from biological tissues. With ion mobility-enabled data-independent acquisition and automated spectrum deconvolution, MS/MS spectra of a large number of lipid species from each tissue pixel are acquired, at no expense of imaging speed. MMSD imaging is highlighted by MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids in the mouse brain and the revealing of the correlation of a structurally distinct phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Mapping of structurally distinct lipid isomers is now enabled and spatial lipidomics becomes feasible for MSI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular insertion strategy is used by introducing non&#8208;covalent interactions in COFs to form a continuous charge transfer channel and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Meanwhile, the enhanced conductivity activates the redox sites in the COF skeleton, resulting in excellent energy storage performance. In addition, the energy storage behavior can be accurately regulated by changing the type of insertion guests.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8722;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8722;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of a Vinyl Thianthrenium Salt and Secondary Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report an unprecedented reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides, which expands on the currently possible reductive Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the first reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides. The reaction uses a vinyl thianthrenium salt, a palladium catalyst, and an alkyl zinc intermediate formed in situ to trap the LnPdII(vinyl) complex formed after oxidative addition before it undergoes undesired homocoupling to form butadiene.

         <title>Increasing Reduction Potentials of Type 1 Copper Center and Catalytic Efficiency of Small Laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor through Secondary Coordination Sphere Mutations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction potential of type&#8197;1 copper (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) in small laccase (SLAC) has been tuned through mutations of residues in the secondary coordination sphere, with the aim to mimic those in high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu fungal laccases. With three such mutations, we have increased E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu from wild&#8208;type SLAC by +189&#8197;mV to 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE, which is the highest reported to date. We have demonstrated additive E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu tuning of the three mutations and improved catalytic efficiency of the mutants relative to wild&#8208;type SLAC.







Abstract
The key to type 1 copper (T1Cu) function lies in the fine tuning of the CuII/I reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) to match those of its redox partners, enabling efficient electron transfer in a wide range of biological systems. While the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) effects have been used to tune E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu in azurin over a wide range, these principles are yet to be generalized to other T1Cu&#8208;containing proteins to tune catalytic properties. To this end, we have examined the effects of Y229F, V290N and S292F mutations around the T1Cu of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor to match the high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of fungal laccases. Using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, together with X&#8208;ray crystallography and redox titrations, we have probed the influence of SCS mutations on the T1Cu and corresponding E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu. While minimal and small E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increases are observed in Y229F&#8208; and S292F&#8208;SLAC, the V290N mutant exhibits a major E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increase. Moreover, the influence of these mutations on E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu is additive, culminating in a triple mutant Y229F/V290N/S292F&#8208;SLAC with the highest E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE reported to date. Further activity assays indicate that all mutants retain oxygen reduction reaction activity, and display improved catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) relative to WT&#8208;SLAC.

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated AuIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene bisimide modified by cyclometalated AuIII complex with unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model in crystalline state was synthesized and employed for controlled fabrication of monolayer films via the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. Based on the film, a conceptual luminescent sensor was further developed, which allowed high&#8208;performance sensing of a new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine.







Abstract
Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8722;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt;4&#8197;ppb, &lt;1&#8197;s, and &lt;5&#8197;s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.

         <title>Breaking Surface Atomic Monogeneity of Rh2P Nanocatalysts by Defect&#8208;Derived Phosphorus Vacancies for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;derived surface phosphorus vacancies on ultrathin Rh2P nanowires break the monogeneity and atomic regularity of thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces, which can create additional Rh sites to act as exclusive H adsorption sites and diminish the inhibition effect of the interfacial water network to achieve drastically improved alkaline HOR electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces is promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi&#8208;step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect&#8208;derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P&#8208;vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P&#8208;terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p&#8208;Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d&#8208;Rh2P). The P&#8208;vacancies enable the exposure of sub&#8208;surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites. Therein, the Had cooperates with the OHad on the peripheral P&#8208;sites to effectively accelerate the alkaline HOR. Defective Rh2P nanowires (d&#8208;Rh2P NWs) and perfect Rh2P nanocubes (p&#8208;Rh2P NCs) are then elaborately synthesized to experimentally represent the d&#8208;Rh2P and p&#8208;Rh2P catalytic surfaces. As expected, the P&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched d&#8208;Rh2P NWs catalyst exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and outstanding CO tolerance for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, attaining 5.7 and 14.3&#8197;times mass activity that of p&#8208;Rh2P NCs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. This work sheds light on breaking the surface atomic monogeneity for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Macrocyclic Encapsulation in a Non&#8208;fused Tetrathiophene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with High Short&#8208;Circuit Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor R4T&#8208;1 was designed via macrocyclic encapsulation on the simple tetrathiophene, which achieves conformational unicity, eliminates intermolecular electronic cross&#8208;communication at the center and guarantees the formation of efficient charge transport channels. Thus, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.10&#8201;% with a significantly enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2 was accomplished.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors have shown great promise for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, challenges in achieving high efficiency molecular system with conformational unicity and effective molecular stacking remain. In this study, we present a new design of non&#8208;fused tetrathiophene acceptor R4T&#8208;1 via employing the encapsulation of tetrathiophene with macrocyclic ring. The single crystal structure analysis reveals that cyclic alkyl side chains can perfectly encapsulate the central part of molecule and generate a conformational stable and planar molecular backbone. Whereas, the control 4T&#8208;5 without the encapsulation restriction displays cis&#8208; and twisted conformation. As a result, R4T&#8208;1 based OSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 15.10&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2, which is significantly improved by &#8776;30&#8201;% in relative to that of the control. Our findings demonstrate that the macrocyclic encapsulation strategy could assist fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors (FNEAs) to achieve a high photovoltaic performance and pave a new way for FNEAs design.

         <title>Tetra&#8208; and Hexavalent Siglec&#8208;8 Ligands Modulate Immune Cell Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siglec&#8208;8 is a potential therapeutic target for eosinophil&#8208; and mast&#8208;cell&#8208;related disorders. With structural modifications and oligo&#8208; to multivalent presentations, the low affinity of the natural ligand was decisively improved. As shown in immune cell assays, a biological effect is not only induced by a multivalent but also by a hexavalent ligand, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, shows only an antagonistic effect.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are generally characterized by poor affinities for their natural glycan ligands, predominantly due to the shallow and solvent&#8208;exposed binding sites. To overcome this drawback, nature has exploited multivalency to strengthen the binding by establishing multiple interactions simultaneously. The development of oligovalent structures frequently proved to be successful, not only for proteins with multiple binding sites, but also for proteins that possess a single recognition domain. Herein we present the syntheses of a number of oligovalent ligands for Siglec&#8208;8, a monomeric I&#8208;type lectin found on eosinophils and mast cells, alongside the thermodynamic characterization of their binding. While the enthalpic contribution of each binding epitope was within a narrow range to that of the monomeric ligand, the entropy penalty increased steadily with growing valency. Additionally, we observed a successful agonistic binding of the tetra&#8208; and hexavalent and, to an even larger extent, multivalent ligands to Siglec&#8208;8 on immune cells and modulation of immune cell activation. Thus, triggering a biological effect is not restricted to multivalent ligands but could be induced by low oligovalent ligands as well, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, showed an antagonistic effect.

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide clusters based on trivalent lanthanide ions have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Furthermore, the introduction of trivalent antimony (Sb3+) doping results in the emergence of new energy&#8208;level structures for electronic transitions, which enables precise control over the emission color by varying the excitation wavelength.







Abstract
The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8211;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+=[CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+=Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90&#8211;100&#8201;%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.

         <title>Al2O3&#8208;coated BiVO4 Photoanodes for Photoelectrocatalytic Regioselective C&#8722;H Activation of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the regioselective activation of aromatic amines C&#8722;H bonds is reported using a BiVO4 photoanode coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 protective layer, overcoming the problems of low reactivity and poor stability in photoelectrocatalytic organic synthesis. The deposition of Al2O3 enables maintaining stable photocurrent and the yield of the target product dramatically increases from 48&#8201;% to 84&#8201;%. Beyond high efficiency and excellent repeatability, this photoelectrocatalytic strategy exhibits good functional group tolerance and environmental friendliness, making it promising for sustainable organic transformations.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry is becoming an innovative approach to organic synthesis. Generally, the current photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations suffer from limited reaction type, low conversion efficiency and poor stability. Herein, we develop efficient and stable photoelectrode materials using metal oxide protective layer, with a focus on achieving regioselective activation of amine compounds. Notably, our photoelectrochemistry process is implemented under mild reaction conditions and does not involve any directing groups, transition metals or oxidants. The results demonstrate that beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis exhibits high efficiency, remarkable repeatability and good functional group tolerance, highlighting its great potential for applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Near&#8208;Infrared Chlorinated Rylenecarboximide Fluorophores via Consecutive C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. These fluorophores show high fluorescence quantum yields, together with large Stokes shifts and high photostability, qualifying them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.







Abstract
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, PAI, is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. Owing to the rigid structure, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and pronounced push&#8208;pull substitution, these fluorophores show emission maxima up to 804&#8197;nm and large Stokes shifts. The extraordinarily high fluorescence quantum yields from 47&#8201;% to 70&#8201;% are attributed to chloro substitution in the bay positions of the perylene core. These characteristics, together with high photostability, qualify them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) with Brilliant Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with optimized two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) performance were constructed by building block modification and crystal engineering, showing good performance in two&#8208;photon cellular imaging applications.







Abstract
By synergistically employing four key strategies: (I)&#8197;introducing tetraphenylethylene groups as the central core unit with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, (II)&#8197;optimizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated length by extending the building block branches, (III)&#8197;incorporating flexible groups containing ethylenic bonds, and (IV)&#8197;applying crystal engineering to attain dense stacking mode and highly twisty conformation, we successfully synthesized a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibiting exceptional one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. Notably, when utilizing the fluorescently superior building block L2, HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;7 and HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;8 exhibiting high quantum yields (QY) of 82.1&#8201;% and 77.1&#8201;%, and ultrahigh two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections of 148959.5&#8197;GM and 123901.1&#8197;GM were achieved. These materials were successfully employed in one and two&#8208;photon excited lysosome&#8208;targeting cellular imaging. It is believed that this strategy, combining building block optimization and crystal engineering, holds significant potential for guiding the development of outstanding fluorescent HOF materials.

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
129Xe NMR spectroscopy of a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline material fabricated using imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles revealed a spatiotemporally continuous void inside the column. The diameter of the channel&#8208;like nanospace was estimated to be 0.49&#8197;nm, and the diffusion coefficient of the Xe atoms inside the nanochannels was comparable to those of conventional microporous solid materials.







Abstract
Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy for ortho&#8208;Aminophenol Synthesis via Dearomative&#8208;Rearomative Coupling Between Aryl Azides and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of aryl azides with purple light in the presence of alcohols enables the direct preparation of challenging ortho&#8208;aminophenols. The process goes via a singlet nitrene&#8208;mediated dearomative&#8208;rearomative cascade that enables introduction of the alcohol in place of the azide and shifts the amino group to its ortho&#8208;position.







Abstract
ortho&#8208;Aminophenols are aromatic derivatives featuring vicinal N&#8208; and O&#8208;based functionalities commonly found in the structures of many high&#8208;value materials. These molecules are generally prepared using multistep strategies that follow the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Despite their high fidelity, such approaches cannot target substrates featuring a &#8220;contra&#8208;SEAr&#8221; arrangement of N&#8208; and O&#8208;groups. Here we report an alternative strategy for the preparation of such ortho&#8208;aminophenols using aryl azides as the precursors. The process utilizes low&#8208;energy photoexcitation to trigger the decomposition of aryl azides into singlet nitrenes that undergo a dearomative&#8208;rearomative sequence. This allows the incorporation of alcoholic nucleophiles into a seven&#8208;membered ring azepine intermediate via temporary disruption of aromaticity, followed by electrophile&#8208;induced re&#8208;aromatization. The net retrosynthetic logic is that the alcohol displaces the azide, which, in turn, moves to its ortho position and furthermore is converted into an amide. The synthetic value and complementarity of this strategy has been demonstrated by the coupling of aryl azides with complex, drug&#8208;like alcohols and phenols as well as amines, thiols and thiophenols, which provides a general platform for the fast and selective heterofunctionalization of aromatics.

A BaTiO3 lattice is shown in the background of the cover picture, with the stack of orange balls symbolizing Cu nanoparticles. Pipes delivering the reactants and products have the shapes of H&#8722; and e&#8722; indicating they are involved in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Lattice O is replaced with hydrides for the enhanced performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, as demonstrated by Zili Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202313389).

         <title>Cover Picture: Tailoring Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper by Reactive Ionic Liquid and Native Hydrogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic interplay between a copper electrode and a reactive ionic liquid is illustrated in the cover picture, showcasing key components in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The role of the cation in covering the electrode surface and the in&#8208;situ generated hydrogen bond donor from CO2&#160;binding to the ionic liquid in enhancing the kinetics were uncovered by in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, complemented by electroanalytical and computational methods. Multi&#8208;carbon products with reduced reaction energy were obtained, as reported by Burcu Gurkan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312163). Cover image credit: Miguel Munoz.

         <dc:description>
The successful creation of &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; protein nanocrystals, which demonstrate ultra&#8208;rapid crystalline cross&#8208;linking behavior at pH levels above 7.6, underpins the concept of a protein conformation proton transistor. As reported by Peng Yang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310879), this pH&#8208;triggered cross&#8208;linking can be feasibly accomplished under conditions that resemble physiological environments, highlighting its significant potential in biomedicine, biosensing, and microfluidic chemistry.

         <title>Back Cover: Exploration of Chemical Diversity in Intercellular Quorum Sensing Signalling Systems in Prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide chemical diversity in bacterial languages is explored in the Research Article by Markus B. Linder et&#8197;al. (e202314469). The structural similarities were mapped theoretically and sets of both closely related and widely diverging ligand structures experimentally investigated. The results suggest that structural diversity in quorum sensing ligands can be used as a starting point to predict non&#8208;cognate binding in intercellular signalling systems. Orthogonal signalling systems could significantly advance our engineering capabilities of microbial communities.

         <title>Methylene C(sp3)&#8211;H Arylation&#160;Enables the Stereoselective Synthesis and Structure Revision of Indidene Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The divergent synthesis of two indane polyketides of the indidene family, namely (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A (11 steps, 1.7%) and (+)&#8208;indidene C (13 steps, 1.3%), is reported. The synthesis of the trans&#8208;configured common indane intermediate was enabled by Pd0&#8208;catalyzed methylene C(sp3)&#8211;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective (e.r. &gt;99:1) modes. Further elaboration of this common intermediate by Ni&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling allowed the rapid installation of the aroyl moiety of (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A. In parallel, the biphenyl system of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;indidene C was constructed via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. These investigations led us to revise the structures of indidenes B and C.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of a Reactive [Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV)] Species and its Facile Equilibrium with Related Mn(IV)(OX) (X = Sc or H) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acid&#8208;bound high valent Mn&#8208;oxo species are of great importance due to their relevance to photosystem II. Here we report the synthesis of a unique [(BnTPEN)Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV)(NO3)4]+ adduct (2), by the reaction of (BnTPEN)Mn(II) (1) with 4 eq. ceric ammonium nitrate. 2 has been characterized using UV/Vis, NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Treatment of 2 with Sc(III)(OTf)3 results in the formation of (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8211;O&#8211;Sc(III) (3), while HClO4 addition to 2 forms (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8211;OH (4), reverting to 2 upon Ce(III)(NO3)3 addition. 2 can also be prepared by the oxidation of 1 eq.

The binding of redox&#8208;active Ce(IV) boosts electron transfer efficiency of 2 towards ferrocenes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lewis acid-bound high valent Mn-oxo species are of great importance due to their relevance to photosystem II. Here we report the synthesis of a unique [(BnTPEN)Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV)(NO3)4]+ adduct (2), by the reaction of (BnTPEN)Mn(II) (1) with 4 eq. ceric ammonium nitrate. 2 has been characterized using UV/Vis, NMR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, as well as by mass spectrometry. Treatment of 2 with Sc(III)(OTf)3 results in the formation of (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8211;O&#8211;Sc(III) (3), while HClO4 addition to 2 forms (BnTPEN)Mn(IV)&#8211;OH (4), reverting to 2 upon Ce(III)(NO3)3 addition. 2 can also be prepared by the oxidation of 1 eq. Ce(III)(NO3)3 with [(BnTPEN)Mn(IV)=O]2+ (5). In addition, the EPR spectroscopy revealed the elegant temperature-dependent equilibrium between 2 and Mn(IV) species. The binding of redox-active Ce(IV) boosts electron transfer efficiency of 2 towards ferrocenes. Remarkably, the newly characterized Mn(III)&#8211;O&#8211;Ce(IV) species can carry out O-atom and H-atom transfer reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AIEgens Cross&#8208;linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Synchronously Amplify Bimodal Imaging Signals in Situ by Tumor Acidity&#8208;Mediated Click Reaction</title>

Utilizing the aggregation&#8208;enhanced r2 relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles and the aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of AIEgens, a non&#8208;conjugated/coupled dual&#8208;mode probe design strategy is developed to synergistically enhance both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance contrast.







Abstract
Activatable dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging probes present a promising tool for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, synchronously enhancing dual&#8208;modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity&#8208;mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity&#8208;responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross&#8208;linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (&#8776;12.4&#8208;fold) and r2 relaxivity (&#8776;2.8&#8208;fold). cDIOs and AATs were effectively activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross&#8208;linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.
