         <title>Tailoring a Near&#8208;Infrared Macrocyclization Scaffold Allows the Control of In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly for Photoacoustic/PET Bimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore was tailored as a PAI&#8208;active macrocyclization scaffold for controlling macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly, which enabled the development of a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PET/PAI bimodal probe [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 for noninvasive imaging of drug&#8208;induced tumor apoptosis in vivo, with potential for the early monitoring of tumor response to chemotherapy.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;triggered macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of small molecules into nanoparticles has shown promise to design activatable probes for molecular imaging. However, controlling macrocyclization and self&#8208;assembly to concurrently augment positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) signals for bimodality imaging is challenging. Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self&#8208;assembly and design a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PA/PET bimodal probe ([18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high&#8208;sensitivity whole&#8208;body imaging signals offered by PET with the high&#8208;resolution imaging signals offered by PA, [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful for optimizing the therapeutic protocol for patients. This scaffold may be adopted to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging.

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Regulated Interfacial Selective Superassembly of Asymmetric Smart Nanovehicles with Tailored Topological Hollow Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites with tunable diameters, topological architectures and components. Benefiting from the unique asymmetric hollow porous structure and photothermal effect, these nanoparticles are utilized as smart NIR light&#8208;triggered nanovehicles.







Abstract
Hollow nanoparticles featuring tunable structures with spatial and chemical specificity are of fundamental interest. However, it remains a significant challenge to design and synthesize asymmetric nanoparticles with controllable topological hollow architecture. Here, a versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites (AHPCs) with tunable diameters, architectures and components. The size and number of patches on Janus nanoparticles can be precisely manipulated by the precursor and catalyst content. Notably, AHPCs exhibit excellent photothermal conversion performance under the irradiation of a near infrared (NIR) laser. Thus, AHPCs are utilized as NIR light&#8208;triggered nanovehicles and cargos can be controllably released. In brief, this versatile superassembly approach offers a streamlined and powerful toolset to design diverse asymmetric hollow porous composites.

         <title>Depositing Molecular Graphene Nanoribbons on Ag(111) by Electrospray Controlled Ion Beam Deposition: Self&#8208;Assembly and On&#8208;Surface Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons, deposited by electrospray controlled ion beam deposition, form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers after multiple chemical transformations employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols. These transformations and the nature of the metal&#8211;organic coordination motifs are investigated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy.







Abstract
The chemical processing of low&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures is crucial for their integration in future devices. Here we apply a new methodology in atomically precise engineering by combining multistep solution synthesis of N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with mass&#8208;selected ultra&#8208;high vacuum electrospray controlled ion beam deposition on surfaces and real&#8208;space visualisation by scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate how this method yields solely a controllable amount of single, otherwise unsublimable, GNRs of 2.9&#8197;nm length on a planar Ag(111) surface. This methodology allows for further processing by employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols and exploiting the reactivity of the substrate. Following multiple chemical transformations, the GNRs provide reactive building blocks to form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers.

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) was introduced into the host&#8211;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing the colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behaviors.







Abstract
Monotonous luminescence has always been a major factor limiting the application of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Enhancing and regulating the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest is an effective strategy to achieve excellent phosphorescence performance. In this study, intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) was introduced into the host&#8211;guest RTP system. The interaction promoted intersystem crossing and stabilized the triplet excitons, thus helping to achieve strong phosphorescence emission. In addition, the weak intermolecular interaction of halogen bonding is sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, mechanical force, and X&#8208;rays. Therefore, the triplet excitons were easily quenched and colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli responsive behaviors were realized, which greatly enriched the luminescence functionality of the RTP materials. This method provides a new platform for the future design of responsive RTP materials based on weak intermolecular interactions between the host and guest molecules.

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to generate the largest aluminum molecular rings is presented. Their nonlinear optics (NLO) and optical limiting (OL) performance is studied by the Z&#8208;scan technique. The results provide insights to understand the NLO structure&#8211;activity relationship and tune the NLO performance at a molecular level.







Abstract
Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2&#215;9 and 3&#215;6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0&#8197;nm to 1.7&#8197;nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics.

In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single-crystal X-ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2&#215;9 and 3&#215;6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0&#8197;nm to 1.7&#8197;nm. The picosecond Z-scan measurements results revealed that the third-order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Targeted Delivery of an Immune Stimulant that Selectively Reactivates Exhausted CAR T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chronic exposure of CAR T cells to tumor antigens can lead to CAR T cell exhaustion and tumor expansion. To reverse this exhaustion, we have developed two orthogonal strategies to target a potent TLR7 agonist specifically to exhausted CAR T cells. We demonstrate here that both strategies rejuvenate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1+Tim&#8208;3+) and shrinkage of CAR T cell resistant tumors.







Abstract
Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated significant promise in suppressing hematopoietic cancers, their applications in treating solid tumors have been limited by onset of CAR T cell exhaustion that accompanies continuous CAR T cell exposure to tumor antigen. To address this limitation, we have exploited the abilities of recently designed universal CARs to bind fluorescein and internalize a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7 agonist conjugate by CAR&#8208;mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate here that anti&#8208;fluorescein CAR&#8208;mediated uptake of a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7&#8208;3 conjugate can reactivate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1+Tim&#8208;3+) and shrinkage of otherwise resistant tumors without inducing systemic activation of the immune system. We conclude that CAR T cell exhaustion can be reversed by administration of a CAR&#8208;targeted TLR7 agonist, thereby enabling the CAR T cells to successfully treat solid tumors without incurring the systemic toxicity that commonly accompanies administration of nontargeted TLR7 agonists.

         <title>Reversible One&#8208; to Two&#8208; to Three&#8208;Dimensional Transformation in CuII Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible multi&#8208;dimensional transformation of a coordination polymer composed of CuII ions and terephthalate ligands was achieved for the first time by controlling the coordination environment. The dimensional transformation led to the significant changes in chemical and physical properties specific to coordination polymers, such as gas sorption and magnetism.







Abstract
A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising CuII ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cu&#8208;paddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of CuII in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on CuII&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.

         <title>Encoding Enantiomeric Molecular Chiralities on Graphene Basal Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral graphene is directly prepared by transferring the chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto the graphene basal plane through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction followed by thermal fusion. The chiral graphene is characterized using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as spectroscopic techniques and demonstrated to be useful as electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition.







Abstract
Graphene has demonstrated broad applications due to its prominent properties. Its molecular structure makes graphene achiral. Here, we propose a direct way to prepare chiral graphene by transferring chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto graphene basal plane through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction followed by thermal fusion. Using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy, we estimated an areal coverage of the molecular imprints (chiral regions) up to 64&#8201;% on the basal plane of graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition). The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to &#8220;thermal fusion&#8221;. Such &#8220;molecular chirality&#8208;encoded graphene&#8221; was tested as an electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition. The chirality&#8208;encoded graphene might find use for other chirality&#8208;related studies and the encoding procedure might be extended to other two&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolution of High Mechanical Strength Dry&#8208;Network Polythiourethane Thermosets into Neat Macroscopic Hollow Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to obtain macroscopic hollow structures was developed involving a self&#8208;evolution process from dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermosets (PTUs) polymer films to neat hollow&#8208;containing objects via immersion of aqueous NaOH solutions.







Abstract
Organism&#8208;inspired hollow structures are attracting increasing interest for the construction of various bionic functional hollow materials. Next&#8208;generation self&#8208;evolution hollow materials tend to combine simple synthesis, high mechanical strength, and regular shape. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermoset with excellent mechanical performance. The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well&#8208;organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in an aqueous NaOH solution. The self&#8208;evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time. This unique self&#8208;evolution behavior was further utilized to produce a series of macroscopic 3D hollow&#8208;containing molds, which could be potentially applied in the production of smart materials.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by a Dual&#8208;Function Cobalt Catalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles is reported, which employs an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. The method is characterized by its excellent functional group tolerance, substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes, and scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) with a low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv).







Abstract
The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre&#8208;functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value&#8208;added alkenyl&#8208;substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through H2 evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv) and its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex structures.

These C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H cross-coupling reactions proceed through H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv) and its successful application in the late-stage functionalization of complex structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical quantitative measurements of vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level reveals a sex difference in transmitter release during exocytosis, which might relate to the sex difference of the expression level of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. This research provides a new perspective to understand sex dimorphism in exocytosis.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level are essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in the male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in the female group release part of the neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in exocytosis.

         <title>Logical Analysis of Multiple Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Polymorphisms with Programmable DNA Molecular Computation for Clinical Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general DNA computational strategy for automatically correlating detected single nucleotide mutation (including insertions, deletions and SNPs) based information to phenotypic outcomes by integration of multiplexed sensing and logical analysis.







Abstract
Analyzing complex single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) combinations in the genome is important for research and clinical applications, given that different SNP combinations can generate different phenotypic consequences. Recent works have shown that DNA&#8208;based molecular computing is powerful for simultaneously sensing and analyzing complex molecular information. Here, we designed a switching circuit&#8208;based DNA computational scheme that can integrate the sensing of multiple SNPs and simultaneously perform logical analysis of the detected SNP information to directly report clinical outcomes. As a demonstration, we successfully achieved automatic and accurate identification of 21 different blood group genotypes from 83 clinical blood samples with 100&#8201;% accuracy compared to sequencing data in a more rapid manner (3&#8197;hours). Our method enables a new mode of automatic and logical sensing and analyzing subtle molecular information for clinical diagnosis, as well as guiding personalized medication.

         <title>Flexible Soft&#8208;Solid Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel flexible soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes were developed on commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrates. The quasi&#8208;vertically oriented, solid Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 particles grown on the PVDF substrate provided predominant molecular sieving gas entrances, while the soft polyamide eliminated defects enclosing MOF particles, resulting in a superior H2/CO2 separation factor which far exceeded those of MOF&#8208;based membranes reported to date.







Abstract
The development of a facile strategy to construct defect&#8208;free and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes with high selectivity and good scalability holds great appeal. Here we report the fabrication of soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes on polyvinylidene fluoride substrates. A representative membrane comprised of quasi&#8208;vertically grown lamellar Zn2(Bim)4 (Bim=benzimidazolate) and lateral ultrathin polyamide film adhering to the MOF side facets. The straight interlayer galleries within unwrapped Zn2(Bim)4 acted as predominant pathways, while the polyamide served the function of defect elimination, synergistically inducing an unprecedented H2/CO2 selectivity of 1084 which set a new record for MOF&#8208;based membranes. Separation performance was held constant after membrane rolling up into a tube with a diameter of 3&#8197;mm or folding and unfolding at 90&#176; for 50 times. ZIF&#8208;67 and ZIF&#8208;8 composite membranes based on this strategy also realized extremely high H2/CO2 separation accuracies. These results, which demonstrate the intrinsic molecular sieving capability of MOFs, will promote the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes in practical separation applications.

         <title>Superlattice in a Ru Superstructure for Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets with a superlattice is reported and the significance of the superlattice on electrocatalysis is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, which leads to the lattice contraction and the weakening of the *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance.







Abstract
Superlattices are attracting extensive attention due to their unique properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattices are limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of the superlattice in metal&#8208;based nanostructures on catalysis is unexplored yet. We here report a facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with a superlattice. Characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking Ru layers with twisted angles from 2&#176; to 30&#176;. Owing to the strong synergy between the adjacent layers, Ru MNSs can serve as an efficient catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice can induce the strain effect, which leads to lattice contraction and weak *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance. This work sheds new light on the utilization of the superlattice on enhancing catalysis in metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Carboxyl Methyltransferase Catalysed Formation of Mono&#8208; and Dimethyl Esters under Aqueous Conditions: Application in Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carboxyl methyltransferase FtpM can catalyse methylation and dimethylation of a wide range of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids, showing high regioselectivity for some diacids. The enzymatic methylation works under aqueous conditions and can therefore be integrated into enzyme cascades as demonstrated by the two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot conversion of bioderived HMF to bioplastics precursor FDME.







Abstract
Carboxyl methyltransferase (CMT) enzymes catalyse the biomethylation of carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions and have potential for use in synthetic enzyme cascades. Herein we report that the enzyme FtpM from Aspergillus fumigatus can methylate a broad range of aromatic mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids in good to excellent conversions. The enzyme shows high regioselectivity on its natural substrate fumaryl&#8208;l&#8208;tyrosine, trans, trans&#8208;muconic acid and a number of the dicarboxylic acids tested. Dicarboxylic acids are generally better substrates than monocarboxylic acids, although some substituents are able to compensate for the absence of a second acid group. For dicarboxylic acids, the second methylation shows strong pH dependency with an optimum at pH&#8197;5.5&#8211;6. Potential for application in industrial biotechnology was demonstrated in a cascade for the production of a bioplastics precursor (FDME) from bioderived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts Can Be Employed as Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts and Generate Alkynyl Radicals under Blue&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl sulfonium salts were employed as chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysts for the first time. They display superior capability in the generation of alkynyl radicals under blue&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) has emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis. However, compared with the well&#8208;developed selenium&#8208; and tellurium&#8208;based salt catalysts, the ChB catalysis of sulfonium salts is still unknown. Here, we report a new type of alkynyl&#8208;sulfonium salt ChB catalysis for various ionic transformations, including transfer hydrogenation, bromination, bromolactonization, dimerization of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction and Ritter reaction. More importantly, the photocapability of ChB was first demonstrated to generate alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes. Mechanistic studies shed light on the mechanism of the photoinduced reactions and confirmed the involvement of alkynyl radicals which are difficult to generate otherwise.

         <title>Highly Enhanced Aromatics Selectivity by Coupling of Chloromethane and Carbon Monoxide over H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics by coupling of CH3Cl with CO over H&#8208;zeolites is presented, which achieved 82.2&#8201;% aromatic selectivity with ca. 60&#8201;% BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity over HZSM&#8208;5. 2,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one is detected as an intermediate generated from acetyl group and olefins resulting in a new aromatization.







Abstract
The transformation of methane into high value&#8208;added chemicals such as aromatics provides a more desired approach towards sustainable chemistry but remains a critical challenge due to the low selectivity of aromatics and poor stability. Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH3Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2&#8201;%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60&#8201;% over HZSM&#8208;5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10&#8208;membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one (DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins. Furthermore, isotopic labeling analysis confirms that CO is inserted into the DMCPO and aromatics rings. A new aromatization mechanism is proposed, including the formation of the above intermediates, which conspicuously weakens the hydrogen transfer reaction, leading to a considerable increase of aromatics selectivity and a dramatic drop in alkanes.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Promoted Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Aliphatic Ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and efficient nickel&#8211;phosphine complex has been discovered for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic ketoacids. A proton promoted the activation of C=O bonds and controlled the stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds to obtain the corresponding products in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A robust and highly active homogeneous chiral nickel&#8211;phosphine complex for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;ketoacids has been discovered. The hydrogenation could proceed smoothly in the presence of 0.0133&#8197;mol% catalyst loading (S/C=7500). The coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of Ni(OTf)2 with (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE were explored by 1H NMR and HRMS. The mechanistic studies revealed that a proton promoted the activation of the substrate C=O bond and controlled the stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds. A series of chiral &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;alkyl substituted lactones were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, this catalytic system also demonstrated that levulinic acid produced from a biomass feedstock was converted into chiral &#947;&#8208;valerolactone without loss of ee value.

         <title>Protein Ligation and Labeling Enabled by a C&#8208;Terminal Tetracysteine Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy, based on the regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis at a C&#8208;terminal tetracysteine fusion tag, affording the expressed protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazides is reported. It overcomes some of the major limitations of present expressed protein ligation techniques, and thus significantly complements the chemical protein synthesis toolbox.







Abstract
The hydrazinolysis of S&#8208;cyanylated peptide provides an alternative way to afford protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazide, a key reagent used in native chemical ligation (NCL), without the aid of any inteins or enzymes. The currently used non&#8208;selective S&#8208;cyanylation, however, allows no other cysteine in the protein besides the one at the cleavage site. Herein, we report a regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis strategy achieved via the fusion of a tetracysteine tag to the C&#8208;terminal of the protein of interest. We term it tetracysteine enabled protein ligation (TCEPL). While highly selective, the strategy is applicable for proteins expressed as inclusion bodies, and this was showcased by the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of an iron&#8208;sulfur protein rubredoxin and the catalytic and hinge domains of matrix metalloprotease&#8208;14 (MMP&#8208;14) containing 207&#8197;amino acid residues. Furthermore, the TCEPL strategy was exploited for protein C&#8208;terminal labeling with amino reagents bearing a variety of functional groups, demonstrating its versatility and generality.

The currently used non-selective S-cyanylation, however, allows no other cysteine in the protein besides the one at the cleavage site. Herein, we report a regioselective S-cyanylation and hydrazinolysis strategy achieved via the fusion of a tetracysteine tag to the C-terminal of the protein of interest. We term it tetracysteine enabled protein ligation (TCEPL). While highly selective, the strategy is applicable for proteins expressed as inclusion bodies, and this was showcased by the efficient semi-synthesis of an iron-sulfur protein rubredoxin and the catalytic and hinge domains of matrix metalloprotease-14 (MMP-14) containing 207&#8197;amino acid residues. Furthermore, the TCEPL strategy was exploited for protein C-terminal labeling with amino reagents bearing a variety of functional groups, demonstrating its versatility and generality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework (COF) Derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Unraveling Fundamental Kinetic and Structural Parameters of the Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO, yet methods to evaluate the number of active Ni sites on the surface and turnover frequency remained elusive. Herein, a set of COF&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C candidates is synthesized and a comprehensive analysis is undertaken to quantify the active Ni sites, addressing the relation between synthesis parameters, apparent reactivity, active site density, and turnover frequency.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a potential approach to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals using electricity as feedstock. Abundant and affordable catalyst materials are needed to upscale this process in a sustainable manner. Nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction to CO, and the single&#8208;site Ni&#8722;Nx motif is believed to be the active site. However, critical metrics for its catalytic activity, such as active site density and intrinsic turnover frequency, so far lack systematic discussion. In this work, we prepared a set of covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, for which the Ni&#8722;Nx content could be adjusted by the pyrolysis temperature. The combination of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidenced the presence of Ni single&#8208;sites, and quantitative X&#8208;ray photoemission addressed the relation between active site density and turnover frequency.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization Organocatalysis: From Monomer Mixtures to Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled block polymers from the monomer mixture comprising O&#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide has been realized using a Lewis&#8208;pair organocatalyst. The experimental and computational results highlighted the pivotal roles played by the high polymerizability of the OCA monomer for guaranteeing the exquisite sequence selectivity and the synergistic decarboxylation for facilitating the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide during the switching period.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot production of sequence&#8208;controlled block copolymer from mixed monomers is a crucial but rarely reached goal. Using a switchable Lewis&#8208;pair organocatalyst, we have accomplished sequence&#8208;selective polymerization from a mixture of O&#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide. Polymerization of the OCA monomer occurs first and exclusively because of its exceedingly high polymerizability. When OCA is fully consumed, alternating copolymerization of epoxide and CO2 liberated in OCA polymerization is triggered from the termini of the first block. The two polymerizations thus occur in tandem, both in chemoselective fashion, so that a sequence&#8208;controlled block polymer with up to 99&#8201;% CO2 conversion is furnished in this one&#8208;pot protocol. Calculations and experimental results demonstrate a chemoselective and cooperative mechanism, where the high polymerizability of the OCA monomers guarantees exquisite sequence selectivity and the cooperative decarboxylation partly arose from the stabilization effect by triethylborane, which facilitates the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide.

         <title>Regulation of High Miscibility for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transport in n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host&#8208;dopant miscibility and excellent carrier mobility can be simultaneously achieved in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. High&#8208;mobility polymers usually possess poor miscibility because of strong interchain interactions. Without harming the efficient charge&#8208;transport based on the ordered polymer backbones packing, disordered side&#8208;chains are introduced to accommodate dopants better without disturbing charge&#8208;transport pathways.







Abstract
Strong interchain interactions of conjugated polymers usually result in poor miscibility with molecular dopants, limiting the doping efficiency because of uncontrolled phase separation. We have developed a strategy to achieve efficient charge&#8208;transport and high doping miscibility in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. We solve the miscibility issue through disorder side&#8208;chains containing dopants better. Systemic structural characterization reveals a farther side&#8208;chain branching point will lead to higher disorders, which provides appropriate sites to accommodate extrinsic molecular dopants without harming original chain packings and charge&#8208;transport channels. Therefore, better sustainability of solid&#8208;state microstructure is obtained, yielding a stable conductivity even when overloading massive dopants. This work highlights the importance of realizing high host&#8208;dopant miscibility in molecular doping of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Cyclic Solid&#8208;State Multiple Phase Changes with Tuned Photoemission in a Gold Thiolate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;emissive amorphous AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer undergoes two successive crystallisation phase changes on mild solid&#8208;state heating. The first high symmetric crystalline phase becomes slightly red&#8208;emissive and the second, which has a lower symmetry, exhibits intense luminescence due to the presence of aurophilic interactions. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding, offering potential for non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
The discovery of a universal memory that exhibits fast access speed, high&#8208;density storage, and non&#8208;volatility has fuelled research into phase&#8208;change materials over the past decades. In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for phase&#8208;change random access memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) from amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline1&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read&#8208;out. We believe that the ability of the AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions and at the same time to display distinct optical signals, can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.

In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for phase-change random access memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&amp;lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) from amorphous-to-crystalline1-to-crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read-out. We believe that the ability of the Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions and at the same time to display distinct optical signals, can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyoligosaccharides Enabled by Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photoglycosylation is reported that proceeds through a bromide&#8208;based hydrogen species and electron transfer process. The value of this protocol was well demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of oligosaccharides on a gram scale as well as digoxin and a 20&#8208;mer deoxyglycan in good yields and with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The photoinitiated intramolecular hydroetherification of alkenols has been used to form C&#8722;O bonds, but the intermolecular hydroetherification of alkenes with alcohols remains an unsolved challenge. We herein report the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted 2&#8208;deoxyglycosylation of alcohols with glycals. The glycosylation reaction was completed within 2&#8197;min in a high quantum yield (&#981;=28.6). This method was suitable for a wide array of substrates and displayed good reaction yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this protocol was further demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxyglycans with &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages up to a 20&#8208;mer in length and digoxin with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction involved a glycosyl radical cation intermediate and a photoinitiated chain process.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Computationally Guided Synthesis of SSZ&#8208;43: A One&#8208;Dimensional 12&#8208;Ring Zeolite with Unique Sinusoidal Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After two decades since its discovery, the structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 has been determined as a novel framework comprised of a primitive orthorhombic crystal system with monoclinic faulting that forms unique, 1D 12&#8208;ring sinusoidal channels. A combination of molecular modeling and empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity was used to design two new di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and produce SSZ&#8208;43 across a wide range of high SiO2 compositions.







Abstract
The structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ&#8208;43 framework forms one&#8208;dimensional, sinusoidal 12&#8208;ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; apertures and 12&#8208;ring 6.5&#215;8.9&#8197;&#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ&#8208;43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: &#8776;90&#8201;% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12&#8208;rings, and &#8776;10&#8201;% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si&#8208;SSZ&#8208;43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron&#8208; and aluminum&#8208;containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di&#8208;quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ&#8208;43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono&#8208;quaternary OSDAs.

         <title>Reactivity Differences Enable ROS for Selective Ablation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to engineer selective photodynamic agents to surmount bacterial&#8208;infected diseases, especially Gram&#8208;positive bacteria remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed two examples of compounds for a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study where reactive differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Sulfur&#8208;replaced phenoxazinium (  NBS&#8208;N  ) mainly generates superoxide anion radical capable of selectively killing Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while selenium&#8208;substituted phenoxazinium (  NBSe&#8208;N  ) has a higher generation of singlet oxygen that can kill both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This difference was further evidenced by bacterial fluorescence imaging and morphological changes. Moreover,  NBS&#8208;N  can also successfully heal the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected wounds in mice. We believe that such reactive differences may pave a general way to design selective photodynamic agents for ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected diseases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy (RT) was hampered by the limited oxygen in tumor, which could be potentiated via reprogramming oxygen metabolism and increasing oxygen utilization efficiency. Herein, a metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer (Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX) was integrated by an acid&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (polyethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;polydithiocarbamates, PEG&#8208;DTC) and a hafnium&#8208;chelated polyphenolic semiconducting polymer (Hf&#8208;PSP) in an amphiphilic polymer (poloxamer F127, PLX). Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX elicited a high imaging performance for precise RT and generated H2S to reduce cellular oxygen consumption rate via mitochondrial respiration inhibiting, which reprogrammed oxygen metabolism for tumor oxygenation improvement. Then, Hf&#8208;sensitization would fully utilize the well&#8208;preserved oxygen to intensify RT efficacy and activate immunogenicity. Such synergistic strategy of improvement in oxygenation and oxygen utilization would have a promising prospect in optimizing oxygen&#8208;dependent therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Tunable Chiral 2,2'&#8208;Bipyridine Ligands: Application to the Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of chiral 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine ligands, SBpy, featuring minimized short&#8208;range steric hindrance and structural tunability was rationally designed and developed, and the effectiveness was demonstrated in the first highly enantioselective Ni &#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. In comparison with known approaches using preformed aryl metallic reagents, this reaction is more step&#8208;economical and functional group tolerant. The reaction mechanism and a model of stereocontrol were proposed based on experimental and computational results.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of a Cobalt Diketimide into an Elusive Cobalt Aryl Nitrenoid Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of (  Tr  L)Co (  Tr  L = 5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,9&#8208;(trityl)dipyrrin) toward various aryl azides was examined to elucidate the electronic structure and reactivity of dipyrrinato cobalt aryl nitrenoid complexes. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a Co  II  diketimide complex [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  and its reversible C&#8722;C bond cleavage to yield a monomeric Co nitrenoid complex (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ). Exposure of [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  to an excess amount of an H&#8722;atom donor cleanly affords the Co  II  anilide complex (  Tr  L)Co(NHC  6  F  5  ). The half&#8208;order decay of [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  via H&#8211;atom abstraction (HAA) reveals saturation kinetic behavior indicating a pre&#8208;equilibrium between [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  and (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ) prior to HAA. Furthermore, (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ) undergoes reductive coupling with another equivalent of azide to furnish the four&#8208;coordinate tetrazido complex (  Tr  L)Co(  &#954;  2  &#8208;N  4  (C  6  F  5  )  2  ), expulsion of a fluorine atom to afford (  Tr  L)CoF, and N&#8722;group transfer reactivity to PPh  3&#160;  .</dc:description>

         <title>Distal Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bromination with Aqueous HBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While electrochemical ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl3&#183;3H2O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand&#8208; and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were meta&#8208;selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron&#8208;rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of long n&#8208;peri&#8208;acenes (n&#8208;PAs) is challenging as a result of their inherent open&#8208;shell radical character, which arises from the presence of parallel zigzag edges beyond a certain n value. They are considered as &#960;&#8208;electron model systems to study magnetism in graphene nanostructures; being potential candidates in the fabrication of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface formation of the largest pristine member of the n&#8208;PA family, i.e. peri&#8208;heptacene (n = 7, 7&#8208;PA), obtained on an Au(111) substrate under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Our high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy investigations, complemented by theoretical simulations, provide insight into the chemical structure of this previously elusive compound. In addition, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state of 7&#8208;PA, exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (Jeff) of 49 meV.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Hydroformylation of Propylene by Iodide&#8208;Assisted Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isobutanal is a high value bulk material that, in principle, could be produced with 100% atom&#8208;economy by isoselective hydroformylation of propylene with syngas. However, leading industrial Rh&#8208; and Co&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation methods preferentially form n&#8208;butanal over the iso&#8208;product, and methods offering isoselectivity remain underdeveloped. Here we report an iodide&#8208;assisted Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of propylene that produces isobutanal with unprecedented levels of selectivity. The method involves PdI2, simple alkyl monophosphines, such as tricyclohexylphosphine, and common green solvents, enabling the title reaction to occur with isoselectivity in up to 50:1 iso/n product ratios under industrially relevant conditions (80&#8208;120 &#959;C). The catalytic and preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate a key role of the iodide anions in both the catalytic activity and the isoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals.&#160;However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging.&#160;Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single&#8208;atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru  1  &#8208;NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru  1  &#8208;NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283 V at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , and an optimal 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single&#8208;atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*.&#160;Furthermore, Ru  1  &#8208;NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.</dc:description>

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Rhonin Targets RHOGDI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the discovery of novel chemical matter generally endowed with bioactivity strategies may be particularly efficient that combine previous insight about biological relevance, e.g., natural product (NP) structure, with methods that enable efficient coverage of chemical space, such as fragment based design. We describe the de novo combination of different 5&#8208;membered NP&#8208;derived N&#8208;heteroatom fragments to structurally unprecedented &#8220; pseudo&#8208;natural products&#8221; in an efficient complexity&#8208;generating and enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis sequence. The pseudo&#8208;NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure but occupy areas of chemical space not covered by NP&#8208;derived chemotypes, and may have novel biological targets. Investigation of the pseudo&#8208;NPs in unbiased phenotypic assays and target identification led to the discovery of the first small&#8208;molecule ligand of the RHO GDP&#8208;dissociation inhibitor 1 (RHOGDI1), termed Rhonin. Rhonin inhibits the binding of the RHOGDI1 chaperone to GDP&#8208;bound RHO GTPases and alters the subcellular localization of RHO GTPases.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Decarboxylative Hydroaminoalkylation of Dienol Ethers Enabled by Dual Palladum/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAAs, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes. Herein, we report a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective HAAs of electron&#8208;rich dienol ethers and &#945;&#8208;amino radical derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a unified photoredox and palladium catalytic system. This decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov addition enables the construction of vicinal amino tertiary ethers with high levels of regio&#8208; (up to &gt;19:1 rr), diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;19:1 dr), and enantioselectivity control (up to &gt;99% ee). Mechanistic studies support a reversible hydropalladation as a key step.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraoxa[8]circulenes (TOCs) are a class of hetero[8]circulenes featuring a planar cyclooctatetraene core with a mixed aromatic/antiaromatic motif that governs their electronic properties. Polymeric TOCs (pTOCs) have been the subject of several computational simulations because they are predicted to be low band gap semiconductors, but they have not been available synthetically yet. Here, we report the first example of pTOCs, a new family of porous semiconductors, synthesized under ionothermal conditions through the intermolecular cyclization of 1,4,5,8&#8208;anthracene tetrone. pTOCs are porous, with surface areas up to 1656 m  2  g  &#8211;1  , and exhibit light&#8208;switchable and tunable semiconducting properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, for acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy (PTT), followed by viscosity based therapeutic efficacy evaluation by itself in two independent channels, denoted as &#8220;self&#8208;checking&#8221; strategy. In acidic TME, LET&#8208;1052 was protonated and turned on NIR&#8208;II absorption for PTT under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET&#8208;1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;I fluorescence for real&#8208;time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor&#8208;bearing mice for different periods of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, NIR&#8208;I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Metal Organic Layer Composites for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid the poor conductivity of most pristine metal&#8211;organic frameworks, a free&#8208;standing metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) was exploited to construct diverse composites by a facile post&#8208;synthetic strategy. The structural superiority of the MOLs composites contributes to the excellent and durable performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into formate.







Abstract
2D metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Herein, a freestanding metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with a 2D kgd (kagome dual) lattice was constructed with abundant surface oxygenate groups serving as anchoring sites to immobilize diverse guests. Taking Bi as an example, tetragonal Bi2O3 nanowires can be uniformly grown on MOLs after solvothermal treatment, the structural evolution of which was followed by ex&#8197;situ electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Bi2O3/MOL exhibits excellent CO2 electroreduction activity towards formate reaching a specific current of 2.3&#8197;A&#8201;mgBi&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiencies of over 85&#8201;% with a wide potential range from &#8722;0.87 to &#8722;1.17&#8197;V, far surpassing Bi2O3/UiO (a 3D Zr6&#8208;oxo based MOF) and Bi2O3/AB (Acetylene Black). Such a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy can be flexibly extended to develop versatile MOL composites, highlighting the superiority of optimizing MOL&#8208;based composites for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Molecular Cascade Reactions by a Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control of molecular cascade reactions has been demonstrated by a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA). It provided a complex dynamic model system for mimicking the natural processes and introduced the fundamental concepts to the field of systems chemistry.







Abstract
Inspired by efficient biomolecular reactions in the cell, versatile DNA nanostructures have been explored for manipulating the spatial position and regulating reactions at the molecular level. Spatially controlled arrangement of molecules on the artificial scaffolds generally leads to enhanced reaction activities. Especially, the rich toolset of dynamic DNA nanostructures provides a potential route towards more sophisticated and vigorous regulation of molecular reactions. Herein, a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA) as a dynamic scaffold was adopted in this work for temporal&#8208;controlled and switchable molecular cascade reactions. Dynamic regulation of the assembly of G&#8208;quadruplex, hybridization of parallel&#8208;stranded duplex and assembly of binary DNAzyme were demonstrated. Molecular cascade reactions on the triggered reconfiguration of DODAs were realized, resulting in more complex, dynamic, and switchable control over the reactions.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry Enabled High&#8208;Performance Iodide&#8208;Ion Conversion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inter&#8208;halogen strategy for non&#8208;negative halogen fixation to fully activate and stabilize the unrealized I0/I+ redox via electrolyte modification, leading to two&#8208;electron redox chemistry has been demonstrated. An unprecedented high voltage plateau, capacity, and energy density were obtained with our strategy, which may also particularly advance iodine redox chemistry.







Abstract
A single&#8208;electron transfer mode coupled with the shuttle behavior of organic iodine batteries results in insufficient capacity, a low redox potential, and poor cycle durability. Sluggish kinetics are well known in conventional lithium&#8211;iodine (Li&#8722;I) batteries, inferior to other conversion congeners. Herein, we demonstrate new two&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I&#8722;/I+ with inter&#8208;halogen cooperation based on a developed haloid cathode. The new iodide&#8208;ion conversion battery exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;art capacity of 408&#8197;mAh&#8201;gI&#8722;1 with fast redox kinetics and superior cycle stability. Equipped with a newly emerged 3.42&#8197;V discharge voltage plateau, a recorded high energy density of 1324&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgI&#8722;1 is achieved. Such robust redox chemistry is temperature&#8208;insensitive and operates efficiently at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. With systematic theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the formation of Cl&#8722;I+ species and their functions are clarified.

         <title>Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D helix adopted by a non&#8208;symmetric substituted poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated, and its ability to self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres or fiber&#8208;like structures under the right conditions is also demonstrated. Moreover, by conformational changes in the pendant group it is possible to produce a helix inversion in the PDPA and create a circular polarized luminescence (CPL) switch.







Abstract
The secondary structure of a dissymmetric and chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated by combining the data from NMR experiments (regioregular head to tail structure), Raman and IR studies (E configuration of the polyene double bonds), and high&#8208;resolution AFM images (helical pitch, packing angle and orientation of the external helix). As a result, an E&#8208;transoidal polyene backbone describing three coaxial helices is obtained. Theoretical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies of the structure show a good correspondence between experimental and theoretical data and allow one to decipher that the first Cotton band is generated by the poly(diphenylacetylene) core and not only by the polyene backbone. The dynamic behavior of poly&#8208;(S)&#8208;2 is also demonstrated by a helix inversion effect produced by conformational changes at the pendant groups when annealed in solvents with different donor abilities. This phenomenon is accompanied by an inversion of the circular polarized luminescence of the PDPA (CPL switch).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Band&#8208;Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Bi3+/Te4+ Emitters in Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Cs2SnCl6 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doping was developed to achieve dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emission in perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals with a quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Solid evidence including the transition in photoluminescence lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was provided to unravel the photoluminescence originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+/Te4+.







Abstract
Luminescent metal halides have attracted considerable attention in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting because of their superior optical properties and easy solution processibility. Herein, we report a new class of highly efficient and dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emitters based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doped perovskite derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals. Owing to the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling and efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Te4+, the microcrystals exhibited broad dual&#8208;band white&#8208;light emission originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+ and Te4+, with good stability and a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Specifically, a remarkable transition in Bi3+&#8208;PL lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was observed, as solid evidence for the isolated Bi3+ emission. These findings provide not only new insights into the excited&#8208;state dynamics of Bi3+ and Te4+ in Cs2SnCl6, but also a general approach to achieve single&#8208;composition white&#8208;light emitters based on lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal ion co&#8208;doping.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Assisted Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones using Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones via visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in the presence of HFIP solvent. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to acrylamide derivatives furnishes an essential class of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing oxindole scaffolds. A high level of DFT calculations strongly supports our proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
A visible light photoredox catalytic method for the selective cleavage of single strong C&#8722;F bond in trifluoromethyl ketones is reported. Single electron reduction of trifluoromethyl ketones generates difluoromethyl radicals which can be engaged in intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides to furnish fluorine&#8208;containing oxindole derivatives in good yields. The reaction shows excellent chemoselectivity with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent plays a critical role for the selective single C&#8722;F bond cleavage. High&#8208;level DFT calculations are depicted to shed light on the mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones via visible-light photoredox catalysis is achieved in the presence of HFIP solvent. Trapping of photo-catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to acrylamide derivatives furnishes an essential class of difluoromethyl-containing oxindole scaffolds. A high level of DFT calculations strongly supports our proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescent Probe Allows Simultaneous Imaging of Main and Papain&#8208;like Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Infected Cells for Accurate Detection and Rapid Inhibitor Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
The simultaneous visualization of crucial proteases within SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected cells can be a significant benefit for the accurate detection of virus and rapid screening of inhibitors as well as for understanding the viral lifecycle. The catalytic efficiency, intracellular enzyme activity, and distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease and papain&#8208;like protease have now been exploited using peptide&#8208;based dual&#8208;color FRET probes and their inhibitors.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) and papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) play critical roles in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication and are promising targets for antiviral inhibitors. The simultaneous visualization of Mpro and PLpro is extremely valuable for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and rapid inhibitor screening. However, such a crucial investigation has remained challenging because of the lack of suitable probes. We have now developed a dual&#8208;color probe (3MBP5) for the simultaneous detection of Mpro and PLpro by fluorescence (or F&#246;rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). This probe produces fluorescence from both the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores that are cleaved by Mpro and PLpro. 3MBP5&#8208;activatable specificity was demonstrated with recombinant proteins, inhibitors, plasmid&#8208;transfected HEK 293T cells, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected TMPRSS2&#8208;Vero cells. Results from the dual&#8208;color probe first verified the simultaneous detection and intracellular distribution of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro and PLpro. This is a powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of different proteases with value for the rapid screening of inhibitors.

         <title>Isospecific (Co)polymerization of Unmasked Polar Styrenes by Neutral Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes by neutral racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal catalysts affords perfect isotactic functional polystyrenes. Furthermore, the copolymerization of styrene with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrene produces gradient and random copolymer, respectively. The poison effect of the polar group on the catalysts is dramatically reduced by fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment around the active species.







Abstract
Syndioselective polymerization of unprotected polar styrenes has achieved great success via specially designed catalysts and the establishment of &#8220;self&#8208;assisted&#8221; theory. In contrast, isospecific polymerization of polar styrenes has remained less explored. Herein, we present new racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal complexes and their high activity and perfect isoselectivity (mmmm&gt;99&#8201;%) for the polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes without any activators. Moreover, the copolymerizations of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrenes with styrene give gradient and random copolymers, respectively. The insertion rate of polar monomers could be readily tuned in the range of 0&#8211;100&#8197;mol&#8201;% by changing their loading ratios. The resultant isotactic polar polystyrenes are quantitatively transformed into hydroxyl or methylsulfonyl polystyrenes with high Tgs. DFT calculations reveal the isospecific mechanism.

         <title>Crosslinked Polypeptide Films via RAFT&#8208;Mediated Continuous Assembly of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research into polypeptide films extends beyond polypeptide characterization into their fabrication. Herein, we report the novel fabrication of chemically crosslinked polypeptide films using reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Secondary structure analysis reveals unusually high random coil formation and such films further demonstrate biodegradability useful for tissue engineering and drug delivery.







Abstract
Polypeptide coatings are a cornerstone in the field of surface modification due to their widespread biological potential. As their properties are dictated by their structural features, subsequent control thereof using unique fabrication strategies is important. Herein, we report a facile method of precisely creating densely crosslinked polypeptide films with unusually high random coil content through continuous assembly polymerization via reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (CAP&#8208;RAFT). CAP&#8208;RAFT was fundamentally investigated using methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;lysine (PLLMA) and methacrylated poly&#8208;l&#8208;glutamic acid (PLGMA). Careful technique refinement resulted in films up to 36.1&#177;1.1&#8197;nm thick which could be increased to 94.9&#177;8.2&#8197;nm after using this strategy multiple times. PLLMA and PLGMA films were found to have 30&#8211;50&#8201;% random coil conformations. Degradation by enzymes present during wound healing reveals potential for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.

Controlled thermal treatment of the common decavanadate cluster in the solid state yields a universal precursor for the synthesis of large, metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadates, as demonstrated for three examples.







Abstract
Molecular metal oxides are key materials in diverse fields like energy storage and conversion, molecular magnetism and as model systems for solid&#8208;state metal oxides. To improve their performance and increase the variety of accessible motifs, new synthetic approaches are necessary. Herein, we report a universal, new precursor to access different metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters. The precursor is synthesized by a novel solid&#8208;state thermal treatment procedure. Solution&#8208;phase test reactions at room temperature and pressure show that reaction of the precursor with various metal nitrate salts gives access to a range of metal&#8208;functionalized POVs. The first nitrate&#8208;templated molecular calcium vanadate cluster is reported. We show that this precursor could open new access routes to POV components for molecular magnetism, energy technologies or catalysis.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Activatable DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Enables Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for Combined Gene Therapy</title>

By programming multi&#8208;functional sequences in one ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chain and using it as the scaffold, we developed a lysosomal proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem, which overcomes the countervailing effect of Mn2+ on Cas9 and DNAzyme, and thus achieves efficient co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for combined gene therapy of breast cancer.







Abstract
CRISPR/Cas9 is emerging as a platform for gene therapeutics, and the treatment efficiency is expected to be enhanced by combination with other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem that enables co&#8208;delivery of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme for the combined gene therapy of cancer. Ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chains, which contained the recognition sequences of sgRNA in Cas9/sgRNA, DNAzyme sequence and HhaI enzyme cleavage site, were synthesized as the scaffold of the nanosystem. The DNAzyme cofactor Mn2+ was used to compress DNA chains to form nanoparticles and acid&#8208;degradable polymer&#8208;coated HhaI enzymes were assembled on the surface of nanoparticles. In response to protons in lysosome, the polymer coating was decomposed and HhaI enzyme was consequently exposed to recognize and cut off the cleavage sites, thus triggering the release of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme to regulate gene expressions to achieve a high therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer.

         <title>Carbonylative Polymerization of Epoxides Mediated by Tri&#8208;metallic Complexes: A Dual Catalysis Strategy for Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalysis strategy via carboxylate species featuring weak nucleophilicity and basicity is used for the direct carbonylative polymerization of various epoxides for the production of original advanced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with high molecular weight and tunable functionalization. This study represents a rare example of PHAs synthesis using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of commercially manufactured biodegradable polyesters with properties suitable for partially substituting petroleum&#8208;based plastics. However, high costs and low volumes of production have restricted their application as commodity materials. In this study, tri&#8208;metallic complexes were developed for carbonylative polymerization via a dual catalysis strategy, and 17 products of novel PHAs with up to 38.2&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 Mn values were discovered. The polymerization proceeds in a sequential fashion, which entails the carbonylative ring expansion of epoxide to &#946;&#8208;lactone and its subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization that occurs selectively at the O&#8208;alkyl bond via carboxylate species. The wide availability and structural diversity of epoxide monomers provide PHAs with various structures, excellent functionalities, and tunable properties. This study represents a rare example of the preparation of PHAs using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.

         <title>Selective Fluoromethyl Couplings of Alkynes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and BrCF2H or ICH2F in the presence of zinc is described. This process is based on a nickel&#8208;mediated radical addition/fluoromethyl coupling domino strategy and provides selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H&#8208; and CH2F&#8208;substituted alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We describe here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and fluoromethyl halides (BrCF2H and ICH2F) in the presence of zinc, enabling the facile and selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, merging intramolecular radical cyclization with fluoromethyl coupling enables the expedient constructions of CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated lactones and lactams with high efficiency and selectivity. Mechanistic studies disclose that this catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical addition to an alkyne followed by selective coupling with the fluoromethyl unit.

         <title>Upgrading Carbonate Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;stable Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNO3 is reported to dissolve at concentrations up to 0.7&#8197;M in ethylene carbonate (EC) without need for additives. We show further that various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes can be upgraded with LiNO3 to yield practical batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a widely used salt&#8208;additive that markedly improves the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at a Li metal anode but is generally regarded as incompatible with alkyl carbonates. Here we find that contrary to common wisdom, cyclic carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate can dissolve up to 0.7&#8197;M LiNO3 without any additives, largely improving the anode reversibility. We demonstrate the significance of our findings by upgrading various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes with LiNO3, which provides large improvements in batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes. Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach towards practical LMBs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Step Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Switching in BiOIO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching has been achieved in polar BiOIO3, by using an in situ high&#8208;pressure polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurement system. The step&#8208;wise suppression of the lone&#8208;pair electrons on I5+ cations has been demonstrated to be responsible for the switching phenomenon in BiOIO3, and materials with multi&#8208;stabilities are crucial to next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.







Abstract
Materials with multi&#8208;stabilities controllable by external stimuli have potential for high&#8208;capacity information storage and switch devices. Herein, we report the observation of pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching in polar BiOIO3 for the first time. Structure analyses reveal two pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions in BiOIO3 from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;off). The three&#8208;state SHG switching was inspected by in&#8197;situ high&#8208;pressure powder SHG and polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the in&#8197;situ Raman spectra and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching is caused by the step&#8208;wise suppression of lone&#8208;pair electrons on the [IO3]&#8722; units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO3. Materials with switchable multi&#8208;stabilities provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;art platform for next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.

     alt="Pressure-Driven Two-Step Second-Harmonic-Generation Switching in BiOIO3"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure-driven two-step second-harmonic-generation (SHG) switching has been achieved in polar BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, by using an in situ high-pressure polarization-dependent single-crystal SHG measurement system. The step-wise suppression of the lone-pair electrons on I&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; cations has been demonstrated to be responsible for the switching phenomenon in BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and materials with multi-stabilities are crucial to next-generation switch and information storage devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials with multi-stabilities controllable by external stimuli have potential for high-capacity information storage and switch devices. Herein, we report the observation of pressure-driven two-step second-harmonic-generation (SHG) switching in polar BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the first time. Structure analyses reveal two pressure-induced phase transitions in BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG-high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG-intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG-off). The three-state SHG switching was inspected by in&#8197;situ high-pressure powder SHG and polarization-dependent single-crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the in&#8197;situ Raman spectra and X-ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching is caused by the step-wise suppression of lone-pair electrons on the [IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Materials with switchable multi-stabilities provide a state-of-art platform for next-generation switch and information storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Topologically Engineered Gold Island for Programmed In Vivo Stem Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated processing chain of therapeutic cells based on topologically engineered ligands, nuclease&#8208;mimic artificial enzyme and tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field is constructed. The integration of multiple functional components guides stem cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation detachment, in&#8197;situ magnetic labeling and retention at the implantation site, thus allowing programmed stem cell manipulation in vivo over prolonged time.







Abstract
Even a well&#8208;designed system can only control stem cell adhesion, release, and differentiation, while other cell manipulations such as in&#8197;situ labeling and retention in target tissues, are difficult to achieve in the same system. Herein, native ligand cluster&#8208;mimicking islands, composed of topologically engineered ligand, anchoring point AuNP, nuclease mimetics CeIV complexes and magnetic core Fe3O4, are designed to facilitate comprehensive cell manipulations in a programmable manner. Three islands with different amounts of AuNPs are constructed, which means tunable interligand spacing within a cluster. These nanostructures are chemically coupled to a substrate using DNA tethers. Under a tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field, this integrated system promotes stem cell adhesion, proliferation, mechanosensing, differentiation, detachment, in&#8197;situ effective magnetic labeling and retention both in vitro and in vivo, offering fascinating opportunities for a biomimetic matrix in regenerative medicine.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for In&#8197;Vivo Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent hydrogen probe was developed for the first time by a catalytic hydrogenation strategy, enabling efficient detection of hydrogen molecules in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro with high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, in favor of uncovering and understanding underlying biological behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules.







Abstract
To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. A catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed the super&#8208;high transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cells, animals and plants, and discovered in&#8197;vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.

A new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts in one step via cascade reactions of easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles was developed. Feasibility of the new imidazol(in)ium salts for direct metallation to give M/NHC complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au) was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imidazolium salts have ubiquitous applications in energy research, catalysis, materials and medicinal sciences. Here, we report a new strategy for the synthesis of diverse heteroatom&#8208;functionalized imidazolium and imidazolinium salts from easily available 1,4&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes in one step. The strategy relies on a discovered family of unprecedented nucleophilic addition/cyclization reactions with trialkyl orthoformates and heteroatomic nucleophiles. To probe general areas of application, synthesized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors were feasible for direct metallation to give functionalized M/carbene complexes (M=Pd, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au), which were isolated in individual form. The utility of the chloromethyl function for the postmodification of the synthesized salts and Pd/carbene complexes was demonstrated. The obtained complexes and imidazolium salts demonstrated good activities in Pd&#8208; or Ni&#8208;catalyzed model cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H activation reactions.

         <title>Programmable Transient Supramolecular Chiral G&#8208;quadruplex Hydrogels by a Chemically Fueled Non&#8208;equilibrium Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. Herein, a dynamic boronic ester based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the creation of programmable and transient supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with tunable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and self&#8208;healing properties.







Abstract
The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. By using boronic ester based dynamic covalent chemistry and coupling it with an internal pH feedback system, we have developed a new chemically fueled reaction network for non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with programmable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be controlled by the kinetically controlled in&#8197;situ formation and dissociation of dynamic boronic ester bonds between the cis&#8208;diol of guanosine (G) and 5&#8208;fluorobenzoxaborole (B) in the presence of chemical fuels (KOH and 1,3&#8208;propanesultone), thereby leading to a precipitate&#8208;solution&#8208;gel&#8208;precipitate cycle under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach showed the underlying mechanism of the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly involves aggregation and disaggregation of right&#8208;handed helical G&#8208;quadruplex superstructures. The proposed dynamic boronic ester&#8208;based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy offers a new option to design next&#8208;generation adaptive and interactive smart materials.

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics.







Abstract
Using a mechanism&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free tandem catalytic approach, commodity polyester plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are rapidly and selectively deconstructed by combining the two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C, under 1&#8197;atm H2, affording terephthalic acid (or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid for PEN) and ethane (or butane for PBT) in essentially quantitative yield. This process is effective for both laboratory grade and waste plastics, and comingled polypropylene remains unchanged. Combined experimental and DFT mechanistic analyses indicate that Hf(OTf)4 catalyzes a mildly exergonic retro&#8208;hydroalkoxylation reaction in which an alkoxy C&#8722;O bond is first cleaved, yielding a carboxylic acid and alkene, and this process is closely coupled to an exergonic olefin hydrogenation step, driving the overall reaction forward.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Shape&#8208;Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Boronic Ester Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) exhibiting mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable properties were synthesized by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer networks. This research shines new light onto the development of dynamic covalent polymers for emerging applications in areas of bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optics and smart soft robotics.







Abstract
Endowing a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) exhibiting a helicoidal nanostructure with dynamically tailorable functionalities is of paramount significance for its emerging applications in diverse fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. Here, a mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable CLCE is judiciously designed and synthesized through integrating dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer network. The circularly polarized reflection of CLCEs can be reversibly and dynamically tuned across the entire visible spectrum by mechanical stretching. Thanks to the introduction of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the CLCEs were found to show robust reprogrammable and self&#8208;healing capabilities. The research disclosed herein can provide new insights into the development of 4D (color and 3D shape) programmable photonic actuators towards bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optical systems, and next&#8208;generation intelligent machines.

         <title>Surface Engineering Assisted Size and Structure Modulation of Gold Nanoclusters by Ionic Liquid Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid cations are deployed to regulate the size and structure of AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. Upon mild reduction, such AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes can be easily converted into desired AuI&#8208;thiolate protecting motifs, selectively producing atomically precise gold nanoclusters with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry.







Abstract
Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize the desired Au0 core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging &#960;&#8211;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the AuI&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Featured Supramolecular Tubisomes for Imaging&#8208;Guided Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured cylindrical polymeric nanoparticles (tubisomes) are obtained from the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic cyclic peptide polymer conjugate. Intriguingly, encapsulation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can inactivate the fluorescence of both tubisome and DOX due to the energy transfer relay (ETR). The release of DOX can interrupt the ETR effect and light up the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ visualization of drug release.







Abstract
Polymeric cylinders, a fascinating type of nanostructures with high surface area, internal volume and rigidity, have been exploited as novel drug delivery vehicles over the past decade. However, it's still an open challenge to afford cylindrical nanostructures using polymeric building blocks via traditional self&#8208;assembly processes. Herein, we report a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy of preparing cylindrical aggregates (tubisomes) from an amphiphilic supramolecular bottlebrush polymer in which a cyclic peptide nanotube is employed as the noncovalent backbone. Additionally, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect was introduced into the tubisomes to endow them with excellent fluorescent properties. Intriguingly, by encapsulating with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), both the fluorescence of tubisome and DOX can be quenched due to the energy transfer relay (ETR) effect. The release of DOX can induce the interruption of the ETR effect and recover the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ imaging of drug release. The AIE&#8208;featured supramolecular tubisomes reported here provide an alternative approach for fabricating cylindrical polymeric nanostructures and holds great potential for imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery.

         <title>Tuning Exciton Coupling of Merocyanine Nucleoside Dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA Double Helix Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) is reported as a nucleobase surrogate that forms hydrogen&#8208;bonded base pairs, and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked dimer aggregates, with orientation&#8208; and conformation&#8208;sensitive exciton coupling strength.







Abstract
Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligonucleotides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromophore organization via electrostatic, dipolar, &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The realized supramolecular motifs include hydrogen&#8208;bonded BAM&#8211;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Unraveling the Function of Metal&#8211;Amorphous Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amorphization of the support for single&#8208;atoms catalysts (SACs) is another efficient but unknown strategy in improving the catalytic properties through adjusting the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). This work showcases a model ruthenium SAC and expounds on how the flexibly amorphous configuration of the support matrix functions unexpectedly in intensifying the MSI and further accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics of SACs.







Abstract
Amorphization of the support in single&#8208;atom catalysts is a less researched concept for promoting catalytic kinetics through modulating the metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI). We modeled single&#8208;atom ruthenium (RuSAs) supported on amorphous cobalt/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi) to explore the favorable MSI between RuSAs and the amorphous skeleton for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Differing from the usual crystal counterpart (Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi), the electrons on RuSAs are facilitated to exchange among local configurations (Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Co/Ni) of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi since the flexibly amorphous configuration induces the possible d&#8211;d electron transfer and medium&#8208;to&#8208;long range p&#8211;&#960; orbital coupling, further intensifying the MSI. This embodies Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi with enhanced water dissociation, alleviated oxophilicity, and rapid hydrogen migration, which results in superior durability and HER activity of Ru&#8208;a&#8208;CoNi, wherein only 15&#8197;mV can deliver 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than the 58&#8197;mV required by Ru&#8208;c&#8208;CoNi.

         <title>Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous deformation in elastomeric vitrimers is suppressed by temporarily trapping a reactive side chain in the polymer backbone. Upon heating, the network defect is recovered allowing for fast exchange. This offers a versatile strategy to simultaneously achieve fast reprocessing, while maintaining the strong dimensional stability of vitrimers.







Abstract
We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low Tg vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds via thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on the molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.

         <title>Module&#8208;Patterned Polymerization towards Crystalline 2D sp2&#8208;Carbon Covalent Organic Framework Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new topology diagram was developed for the efficient and designed synthesis of 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D sp2&#8208;carbon materials via a C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and exhibit two&#8208;photon up&#8208;conversion luminescence, create novel 2D semiconductors with low band gaps yet tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretical maxima.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress over the past decade, most polycondensation systems even upon a small structural variation of the building units eventually result in amorphous polymers other than the desired crystalline covalent organic frameworks. This synthetic dilemma is a central and challenging issue of the field. Here we report a novel approach based on module&#8208;patterned polymerization to enable efficient and designed synthesis of crystalline porous polymeric frameworks. This strategy features a wide applicability to allow the use of various knots of different structures, enables polycondensation with diverse linkers, and develops a diversity of novel crystalline 2D polymers and frameworks, as demonstrated by using the C=C bond&#8208;formation polycondensation reaction. The new sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and enable up&#8208;conversion luminescence, offer low band gap semiconductors with tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretically predicted maxima.

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Stereo&#8208; and Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers via Acid&#8208;Orthogonal Deprotection Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection reactions which proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability is reported. This chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers.







Abstract
Absolute control over polymer stereo&#8208; and sequence structure is highly challenging in polymer chemistry. Here, an acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection strategy is proposed for the iterative synthesis of a family of unimolecular polymers starting with enantiopure serines, featuring precise sequence, stereoconfiguration and side&#8208;chain functionalities that cannot be achieved using traditional polymerization techniques. Acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotections proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability. Under p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid, acidolysis of tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl can proceed exclusively, while low&#8208;dosage trifluoroacetic acid and low temperature only trigger the selective and quantitative cleavage of trityl. The pioneering use of this acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers, thus imparting their unique properties beyond natural biopolymers.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu0&#8211;CuI Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst was constructed for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Cu nanoparticles (NPs) derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces and CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces show a tandem effect during the CO2RR process. A high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on this tandem catalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 on a polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt;2&#8201;e&#8722;) selectivity, however, most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst for the production of C2+ products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE
) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu0&#8208;PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C2+ selectivity, whereas CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C2+ selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

A high C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved on this tandem catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a polymer-modified Cu-based catalyst has shown high multi-electron reduction (&amp;gt;2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) selectivity, however, most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)-based Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; tandem catalyst for the production of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; faradaic efficiency (FE
) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-PIL-Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, whereas Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species derived PIL-Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Conversion of Epoxides into Thiiranes: Mechanism, Stereochemical Model, and New Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations have clarified the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of the chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed thionation of epoxides with thiolactam by kinetic resolution. Bulky ortho groups are important to restrict the position of the epoxide group in the key transition states of the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, while increasing the size of the para&#8208;substituents also increases the enantioselectivity significantly.







Abstract
Computations and experiments leading to new chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs) for epoxide thionations are reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism and origin of the enantioselectivity of such CPA&#8208;catalyzed epoxide thionations. The calculated mechanistic information was used to design new efficient CPAs that were tested experimentally and found to be highly effective. Bulky ortho&#8208;substituents on the 3,3&#8242;&#8208;aryl groups of the CPA are important to restrict the position of the epoxide in the key transition states for the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. Larger para&#8208;substituents significantly improve the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid colorimetric detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease using a zwitterionic peptide and gold colloids is reported. The sensor showed good performance in exhaled breath condensate with a limit of detection in the low nanomolar range. This technology can be integrated into regular face coverings for COVID&#8208;detection.







Abstract
The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases a positively charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t&lt;10&#8197;min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10&#8197;nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.

         <title>Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8722;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nitrogen atom transfer into aldehyde C&#8722;H bonds is reported. A palladium(II) metallonitrene species with nitrogen&#8208;centered biradical character was identified as the key intermediate and was photocrystallographically, magnetically and computationally characterized. The nucleophilic metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion step results in inverted selectivity for the net nitrene transfer catalysis.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well&#8208;established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8722;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium. Photocrystallographic, magnetic, and computational characterization support the assignment as an authentic metallonitrene (Pd&#8722;N) with a diradical nitrogen ligand that is singly bonded to PdII. Despite the subvalent nitrene character, selective C&#8722;H insertion with aldehydes follows nucleophilic selectivity. Transamidation of the benzamide product is enabled by reaction with N3SiMe3. Based on these results, a photocatalytic protocol for aldehyde C&#8722;H trimethylsilylamidation was developed that exhibits inverted, nucleophilic selectivity as compared to typical nitrene transfer catalysis. This first example of catalytic C&#8722;H nitrogen atom transfer offers facile access to primary amides after deprotection.

         <title>Back Cover: Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 9/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit displays significantly boosted electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in the presence of water as reported by Rui Cao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202114310). The crown ether unit is able to grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions. The established water network can play critical roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which mimics water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins.

         <title>Cover Picture: Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 9/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D&#8208;helical structure of a non&#8208;symmetric poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) with dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is reported in the Research Article by F&#233;lix Freire et&#8197;al. (e202115070). By conformational changes in the pendant group a helix inversion in the PDPA can be initiated, creating a CPL switch.

Reprogrammable elastomers with dynamic covalent bonds are of paramount significance for emerging applications such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. In their Research Article (e202116219), Ling Wang, Wei Feng, and co&#8208;workers describe mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable, and self&#8208;healable cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers obtained by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain chiral liquid crystalline polymer networks.

         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach with two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics, as reported by Yosi Kratish and Tobin&#8197;J. Marks in their Research Article (e202112576).

         <title>Development of Chiral Ligands for the Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Silylation and Borylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview presents an overview of the recent progress in the design of chiral ligands and substrates for the enantioselective borylation and silylation of C&#8722;H bonds, as well as the salient mechanistic features and reaction scope, thereby revealing the limitations and challenges in this area and inspiring continued development of this synthetic method.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions that install functional groups at the positions of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds can be envisioned to produce intermediates for the synthesis of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals directly from simple feedstocks. Among these C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions, those that form carbon&#8211;silicon (C&#8722;Si) and carbon&#8211;boron (C&#8722;B) bonds have been pursued because the products of these reactions can be converted to those containing a wide range of functional groups and because compounds containing silicon and boron possess unique properties that can be valuable for medicinal and materials chemistry. Although the silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds have undergone extensive development during the past two decades, enantioselective versions of these reactions were not known until a few years ago. In this Minireview, we present the rapid development of enantioselective silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds, with an emphasis on the design and development of the types of chiral ligands needed to achieve these reactions and an intention to inspire an expansion of these types of transformations.

         <title>Application of Perovskite Quantum Dots as an Absorber in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) display the quantum confinement effect yet maintain the characteristics of bulk materials. In this Review the advantages and disadvantages of perovskite QDs and significant strategies (exchange chemistry, passivation engineering, and structure engineering) for the advancement of perovskite solar cells with perovskite QDs as an absorber are discussed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) preserve the attractive properties of perovskite bulk materials and present additional advantages, owing to their quantum confinement effect, leading to their suitability as an absorber in perovskite solar cells. In this Review, the issues and advantages of perovskite QDs are analyzed in the context of purification, device fabrication with perovskite QDs, light absorption, charge transport, and stability. In addition, promising strategies to enhance perovskite QDs and QD&#8208;based solar cells are elucidated based on exchange chemistry (ion and ligand exchange), passivation engineering (ion and ligand passivation), and structure engineering (conventional/inverted, planar/mesoscopic and dimensionally graded structures). These discussions will give a clue to the further development of perovskite QDs and thus the advancement of QD&#8208;based solar cells.

Green living nanofactories: Nanomaterials (NMs) and nanocomposites are typically prepared by procedures that are incompatible with green chemistry and sustainability principles. But some living entities, from single cells to higher organisms, are able to synthesize and process NMs very efficiently under milder conditions. In this Minireview, the advances and prospects of this growing trend are discussed and summarized.







Abstract
Nanomaterials offer exciting properties and functionalities. However, their production and processing frequently involve complex methods, cumbersome equipment, harsh conditions, and hazardous media. The capability of organisms to accomplish this using mild conditions offers a sustainable, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly alternative. Different nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, silica nanostructures, and nanocellulose are being synthesized increasingly through living entities. In addition, the bionanofabrication potential enables also the in situ processing of nanomaterials inside biomatrices with unprecedented outcomes. In this Minireview we present a critical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vision of current nanofabrication approaches mediated by living entities (ranging from unicellular to higher organisms), in order to expand this knowledge and scrutinize future prospects. An efficient interfacial interaction at the nanoscale by green means is within reach through this approach.

         <title>Sensitive Quantification of MicroRNA in Blood through Multi&#8208;amplification Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA&#8208;Strand&#8208;Displacement Paper&#8208;Spray Mass Spectrometry (TSD&#8208;PS MS)</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;amplification paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) platform has been designed for quantifying miRNA in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction and UV light have been employed to amplify the signal and ensure the sensitivity of the detection. More importantly, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interference signals from the blood. The platform showed high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability in a prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141.







Abstract
Accurate quantification of disease&#8208;signature microRNAs (miRNAs) in biomedical samples is in high demand for clinical diagnosis but still challenging because of the low abundance of miRNAs and complicating interferences in the milieus. Here, we report a multi&#8208;amplification strategy based on paper&#8208;spray mass spectrometry (PS MS) for the analysis of miRNAs in blood. A toehold&#8208;mediated DNA&#8208;strand&#8208;displacement reaction (TSD) is employed to amplify the signal chain and to ensure the specificity. The signal chain is then cleaved by UV light to release signal molecules for detection. Moreover, the paper spray method can efficiently filter out interfering substances in the blood and further enhance the sensitivity of detection. This concept is successfully demonstrated in the prototypical detection of the cancer biomarker miRNA&#8208;141 in blood and serum. The proposed TSD&#8208;PS MS approach provides an efficient method for the sensitive detection of oligonucleotides at low concentration in complicated milieus.

         <title>Triplet Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Guest Molecules through Induced Fit in a Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of dynamic nuclear polarization of guest molecules in a porous host material at around room temperature is reported. The induced fit of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) for guest molecules suppresses the nuclear spin relaxation and allows the polarization transfer to target guest molecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization utilizing photoexcited triplet electrons (triplet&#8208;DNP) has great potential for room&#8208;temperature hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. However, the polarization transfer to molecules of interest remains a challenge due to the fast spin relaxation and weak interaction with target molecules at room temperature in conventional host materials. Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts, 1H spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5&#8208;fluorouracil as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host&#8211;guest interactions. Combined with triplet&#8208;DNP and cross&#8208;polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced 19F&#8197;NMR signal of guest target molecules.

         <title>Sn7Br10S2: The First Ternary Halogen&#8208;Rich Chalcohalide Exhibiting a Chiral Structure and Pronounced Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary halogen&#8208;rich nonlinear optical chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2 exhibits a strong phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.5 &#215; AGS@2.1&#8197;&#956;m) and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (6.3 &#215; AGS). This work provides a competitive candidate with good performance, facile synthesis and simple chemical composition for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) applications, and also introduces a facile strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance NLO materials via a symmetry break.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are significant in laser technology for civil and military uses. Here, we report the synthesis, structural chemistry and NLO properties of a halogen&#8208;rich chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2. Its noncentrosymmetric (NCS, P63) structure can be considered as partially aliovalent anion substitution of SnBr2 (P63/m) induced centrosymmetric (CS) to NCS structural transformation. The 3D &#8734;[Sn(1)6Sn(2)6Br6X6]6&#8722; (X=Br/S) channel framework consists of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 trigonal pyramids. It exhibits excellent NLO performance, including a strong phase&#8208;matchable NLO response of 1.5 &#215; AgGaS2and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 6.3 &#215; AgGaS2.Investigation of the structure&#8211;NLO performance relationship confirms that the effective arrangement of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 units predominantly contributes to the large SHG response. These results indicate Sn7Br10S2 is a potential IR NLO candidate and provides a new feasible system for promising NLO materials.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Additions of Enol Silanes to In Situ Generated Cyclic, Aliphatic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated nitrogen heterocycles are essential pharmacophores in drugs and natural products, and general methods for their enantioselective synthesis are still highly sought after. A new direct approach utilizing hemiaminal methyl ethers as N&#8208;acyliminium precursors for the enantioselective preparation of cyclic, aliphatic and 2&#8208;subsituted pyrrolidines, piperidines and azepanes has been achieved.







Abstract
Strong and confined imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) catalysts enable highly enantioselective substitutions of cyclic, aliphatic hemiaminal ethers with enol silanes. 2&#8208;Substituted pyrrolidines, piperidines, and azepanes are obtained with high enantioselectivities, and the method displays a broad tolerance of various enol silane nucleophiles. Several natural products can be accessed using this methodology. Mechanistic studies support the intermediacy of non&#8208;stabilized, cyclic N&#8208;(exo&#8208;acyl)iminium ions, paired with the confined chiral counteranion. Computational studies suggest transition states that explain the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Porous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Networks with Hydrogel&#8208;Like Actuation and Reconfigurable Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network can swell in water for actuation through both water absorption and order&#8211;disorder phase transition, and be loaded with functional fillers to display reconfigurable functions.







Abstract
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network (LCN), prepared by using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100&#8201;% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures a thermally induced shape change associated with a LC&#8208;isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8211;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCNs can be explored for versatile stimuli&#8208;triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquids, photothermal dyes and fluorophores, which imparts the porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light&#8208;driven locomotion, and emissive color.

         <title>Transforming Rhodamine Dyes for (d)STORM Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy via 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Imidazolium Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium markedly improves the photoswitching behavior and overall performance of (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ((d)STORM). Excellent super&#8208;resolution microscopy images are thus obtained under green excitation.







Abstract
We introduce a strategy to optimize the photoswitching behavior of rhodamines for (d)STORM super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium, the resultant dyes are markedly sensitized toward photoswitching, and exhibit outstanding (d)STORM performance with fast on&#8208;off switching, long&#8208;lasting blinking, and bright single&#8208;molecule emission. We thus attain excellent (d)STORM images under green excitation that are on par with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; red&#8208;excited dyes, including for difficult structures such as the mammalian actin cytoskeleton, and demonstrate high&#8208;quality two&#8208;color three&#8208;dimensional (d)STORM.

Abstract
The study of metallopolymers with controllable helical sense remains in its infancy. We report arabinose&#8208;functionalized (Zn&#8208;salphen)&#8208;based conjugated polymers that display mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra for L&#8208; and D&#8208;sugar sidechains respectively, signifying ordered (helical) coiling of the polymer backbone with opposite screw&#8208;sense preferences. The observation of different spectroscopic behavior and Cotton effects for a variety of solvents (in a reversible manner) and temperatures, ascribed to changes in the extent of intrachain (Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(salphen) and &#960;&#8208;stacking) interactions between Zn&#8208;salphen moieties, thus indicate the flexible, responsive and dynamic nature of the folded helical conformation in these systems. An application study signifying that activity can be governed by the structure and helical sense of the polymer is described.

         <title>Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit was designed and synthesized to model water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the crown ether unit of this cobalt corrole can grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions and the established water network plays vital roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to significantly boosted electrocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water&#8208;containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and 1H&#8197;NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown&#8208;ether&#8208;free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1)&#8197;external 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether to extract water molecules and 2)&#8197;potassium ion or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;n&#8208;butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water&#8208;containing networks.

Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the crown ether unit of this cobalt corrole can grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions and the established water network plays vital roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to significantly boosted electrocatalytic HER activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen-bonded water-containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR studies proved that the crown ether of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown-ether-free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1)&#8197;external 18-crown-6-ether to extract water molecules and 2)&#8197;potassium ion or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzyl-n-butylamine to block the crown ether of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water-containing networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Persistent Phosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Thioketyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable thioketyl radical anion formed by reduction of a phosphanylthioketone with alkali metals is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the products were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radicals is mainly localized at the thiocarbonyl C&#8722;S unit.







Abstract
Alkali metal salts, M+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S].&#8722; (M=Na, K; 2_M; Ter=2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)phenyl) containing a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable thioketyl radical anion were obtained by reduction of the thioketone precursor, Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(=S)&#8722;P(iPr)2S (1), with alkali metals (Na, K). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies as well as EPR spectroscopy revealed the unequivocal existence of a thioketyl radical anion in the solid state and in solution, respectively. The computed Mulliken spin density within 2_M is mainly located at the sulfur (49&#8201;%) and the carbonyl carbon (33&#8201;%) atoms. Upon adding [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand to the radical species 2_K to minimize the interionic interaction, an activation reaction was observed, yielding a potassium salt with a phosphanyl thioether based anion, [K(crypt)]+[Ter(iPr)P&#8722;C(&#8722;S&#8208;iPr)&#8722;P(iPr)2S]&#8722; (3) as the product of an intermolecular shift of an iPr group from a second anion. The products were fully characterized and application of the radical anion as a reducing agent was demonstrated.

         <title>Optical Control of Mitosis with a Photoswitchable Eg5 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical control of a mitotic kinesin, Eg5, was achieved through an azobenzene analog of EMD&#8208;534085. Under UV light conditions, HeLa cells undergo mitotic arrest, as evidenced by the formation of a monopolar spindle.







Abstract
Eg5 is a kinesin motor protein that is responsible for bipolar spindle formation and plays a crucial role during mitosis. Loss of Eg5 function leads to the formation of monopolar spindles, followed by mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death. Several cell&#8208;permeable small molecules have been reported to inhibit Eg5 and some have been evaluated as anticancer agents. We now describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of photoswitchable variants with five different pharmacophores. Our lead compound Azo&#8208;EMD is a cell permeable azobenzene that inhibits Eg5 more potently in its light&#8208;induced cis form. This activity decreased the velocity of Eg5 in single&#8208;molecule assays, promoted formation of monopolar spindles, and led to mitotic arrest in a light dependent way.

         <title>H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;Type Global Aromaticity in a 3D Fully Conjugated Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;type global aromaticity was observed in a 3D fully conjugated molecular cage at different oxidation states. The dication 12+ has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; the tetracation 14+ has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic.







Abstract
Global aromaticity in 3D &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular cages remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a fully conjugated molecular cage (1) containing two bridged triphenylamine units and three quinoidal bithiophene arms. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR/ESR measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: 1) its dication (12+) has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and is 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D H&#252;ckel aromatic; 2) its tetracation (14+) has a triplet ground state and is also 3D globally aromatic, with individual macrocycles being 2D Baird aromatic; and 3) its hexacation (16+) has a closed&#8208;shell nature and shows local aromaticity. The study demonstrated a close relationship between 2D H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity and 3D global &#960;&#8208;aromaticity.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Functionalizations of Polyfluorinated Aliphatic Amides and Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic approach to selective functionalization of the strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides is reported, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs through hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of perfluoalkyl units has huge potential towards accessing functionalized organofluorinated compounds, but remains challenging due to the high C&#8722;F bond strength and inherent selectivity challenges. We report a new catalytic approach to the selective functionalization of strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides. This simple reaction proceeds in mild and operational fashion with divergent conversions, including hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.

Chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium salts were used as new phase&#8208;transfer organocatalysts for asymmetric alkylation to construct 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine motifs containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon centers in high yields with excellent cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the possible reaction mechanism and the origins of the exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Novel asymmetric mono&#8208; and dialkylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;substituted 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines catalyzed by new chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium organocatalysts have been developed, resulting in a range of enantioenriched 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine derivatives containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters. The reactions feature high yields (up to 98%), and excellent cis&#8208;diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and they provide a new asymmetric synthetic approach to important functionalized 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine skeletons. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on both control experiments and extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Chirality Drives Separation by Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of N&#8208;protonated Verapamil by electrospray ionization (ESI) yields two peaks when measured by differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). This strange behaviour is caused by protonation&#8208;induced chirality, whereby protonation of Verapamil's tertiary amino moiety during ESI generates diastereomers that can be resolved in the gas phase.







Abstract
Upon development of a workflow to analyze (&#177;)&#8208;Verapamil and its metabolites using differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), we noticed that the ionogram of protonated Verapamil consisted of two peaks. This was inconsistent with its metabolites, as each exhibited only a single peak in the respective ionograms. The unique behaviour of Verapamil was attributed to protonation at its tertiary amino moiety, which generated a stereogenic quaternary amine. The introduction of additional chirality upon N&#8208;protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (R,R), (S,S), (R,S), or (S,R). The (R,R)/(S,S) and (R,S)/(S,R) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques. Protonation&#8208;induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as N&#8208;protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages bearing shape&#8208;shifting bullvalene ligands are prepared. The enormous potential complexity is limited by geometric constraints in solution, which converge to a single isomer in the solid state. Through detailed experimental and computational analysis, we map the fluxional nature of these systems.







Abstract
A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M=Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Prediction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Guest Accessibility from Linker and Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a machine&#8208;learning tool that predicts the porosity of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials based solely on chemical properties of their constituents: the metal and the inorganic linker. Our method leverages data available for thousands of synthesised MOF in prediction of properties of interest in potential synthetic targets without requiring knowledge of their structure but only requiring the knowledge of their constituents.







Abstract
The choice of metal and linker together define the structure and therefore the guest accessibility of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), but the large number of possible metal&#8208;linker combinations makes the selection of components for synthesis challenging. We predict the guest accessibility of a MOF with 80.5&#8201;% certainty based solely on the identity of these two components as chosen by the experimentalist, by decomposing reported experimental three&#8208;dimensional MOF structures in the Cambridge Structural Database into metal and linker and then learning the connection between the components&#8217; chemistry and the MOF porosity. Pore dimensions of the guest&#8208;accessible space are classified into four ranges with three sequential models. Both the dataset and the predictive models are available to download and offer simple guidance in prioritization of the choice of the components for exploratory MOF synthesis for separation and catalysis based on guest accessibility considerations.

         <title>Fluorinated Sulfinates as Source of Alkyl Radicals in the Photo&#8208;Enantiocontrolled &#946;&#8208;Functionalization of Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of gem&#8208;difluoro sulfinates in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds in a chiral fashion is presented. This was tackled by rerouting the chemical pathway of alkyl sulfonyl radicals from traditional sulfonylation to alkylation performance. The efficacy of these sulfinates for assisting SO2 extrusion is shown by allowing the installation of CF2&#8208;bearing scaffolds, a modern task in the pharmaceutical arena.







Abstract
The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a wide range of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less&#8208;stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading&#8208;mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8211;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light&#8208;driven insertion of gem&#8208;difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Mechanochemical Grignard Reactions with Gaseous CO2 and Sodium Methyl Carbonate**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 9, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard&#8208;type reactions have been performed in ball mills providing carboxylic acids from organobromides with gaseous CO2 or sodium methyl carbonate (SMC) as C1&#8208;synthon. The transformations are solvent&#8208;free and occur in the presence of LiOH under liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) conditions with 2&#8197;equivalents of 2&#8208;MeTHF as ethereal additive.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step protocol for the preparation of Grignard reagents from organobromides in a ball mill and their subsequent reactions with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) or sodium methyl carbonate providing aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids in up to 82&#8201;% yield is reported. Noteworthy are the short reaction times and the significantly reduced solvent amounts [2.0&#8197;equiv. for liquid assisted grinding (LAG) conditions]. Unexpectedly, aryl bromides with methoxy substituents lead to symmetric ketones as major products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies are required to address the energy crisis and CO  2  emission. Among various metal&#8208;CO  2  batteries that utilize CO  2  and offer high energy density, rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO  2  batteries based on earth&#8208;abundant and safe magnesium (Mg) metal have been limited due to the lack of compatible electrolyte, operation atmosphere, and ambiguous reaction mechanism. Herein, the first rechargeable nonaqueous Mg&#8208;CO  2  battery is proposed, which can cycle for more than 250 h under the humid environment and maintain the discharge voltage over 1 V at 200 mA g  &#8208;1  . Combining with the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the electrochemical reaction mechanism is revealed to be 2Mg + 3CO  2  + 6H  2  O &#8596; 2MgCO  3  &#183;3H  2  O + C. It is anticipated that the feasibility of rechargeable Mg&#8208;CO  2  batteries would stimulate the development of other multivalent metal&#8208;CO  2  batteries and extend CO  2  fixation and utilization for carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Systematic Understanding of the Influence of Temperature on Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated probing of temperature effects on glycosyl donor activation helped to unravel the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship. Temperature adjustments halved the amount of building block required for a model glycan synthesis.







Abstract
Glycosidic bond formation is a continual challenge for practitioners. Aiming to enhance the reproducibility and efficiency of oligosaccharide synthesis, we studied the relationship between glycosyl donor activation and reaction temperature. A novel semi&#8208;automated assay revealed diverse responses of members of a panel of thioglycosides to activation at various temperatures. The patterns of protecting groups and the thiol aglycon combine to cause remarkable differences in temperature sensitivity among glycosyl donor building blocks. We introduce the concept of donor activation temperature to capture experimental insights, reasoning that glycosylations performed below this reference temperature evade deleterious side reactions. Activation temperatures enable a simplified temperature treatment and facilitate optimization of glycosyl donor usage. Isothermal glycosylation below the activation temperature halved the equivalents of building block required in comparison to the standard &#8220;ramp&#8221; regime used in solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis to&#8208;date.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical investigation of hydrocarbon macrocycle ensembles in solution by comparison of experimental and computed 13C&#8208;NMR spectra. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory allows the deduction of contributing molecular conformations.







Abstract
NMR as a routine analytical method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released CRENSO computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of 13C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cycloalkanes up to C20H40. We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables one to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocycles under ambient conditions from our automated procedure.

         <title>The Stannum&#8208;Ene Reactions of Benzyne and Cyclohexyne with Superb Chemoselectivity for Cyclohexyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stannum&#8208;ene reactions of both benzyne and cyclohexyne were realized, which is particularly suitable for cyclohexyne with a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity. Our DFT calculations via distortion/interaction analysis revealed that both stannum and hydrogen ene reactions with cyclohexyne have later transition states due to their higher distortion energies in transition states than those in benzyne reactions, which lead to enhanced Pauli repulsion as the decisive factor in interaction energy accompanied with enlarged energy gap between two types of ene reactions. Therefore, excellent chemoselectivity was disclosed in the cyclohexyne ene rea ction.</dc:description>

         <title>DREAMTIME NMR Spectroscopy: Targeted Multi&#8208;compound Selection with Improved Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR/MRI are critical tools for studying molecular structure and interactions but suffer from relatively low sensitivity and spectral overlap. Here, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approach, termed DREAMTIME, is introduced that provides &#8220;a molecular window&#8221; inside complex systems, capable of showing only what the user desires, with complete molecular specificity. The user chooses a list of molecules of interest, and the approach detects only those targets while all other molecules are invisible. The approach is demonstrated in whole human blood/urine, small living aquatic organisms in 1D/2D NMR and MRI. Finally, as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, once overlap is removed via DREAMTIME, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;focusing&#8221; approach can be used to increase sensitivity. In human blood and urine, sensitivity increases of 7&#8208;12 fold over standard  1  H NMR are observed. Applicable even to unknowns, DREAMTIME has widespread application, from monitoring product formation in organic chemistry to monitoring/identifying suites of molecular targets in complex media or in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Short Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Actinobolin: Simple Entry to Complex Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a concise synthesis of the naturally occurring protein synthesis inhibitor (+)&#8208;actinobolin (  1  ). The densely functionalized and stereochemically complex molecular structure of  1  was assembled from (&#8208;)&#8208;quinic acid, L&#8208;threonine, and L&#8208;alanine as the principal components. Our route is based around a convergent strategy that features conjugate addition of an &#945;&#8208;amino radical in the key fragment&#8208;coupling step. The dramatically simplified synthesis of (+)&#8208;actinobolin proceeding in 9 steps with 18% overall yield has practical implications for analog preparation, as demonstrated herein.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Stereochemical Confirmation, and Derivatization of a Clerodane Diterpene That Sensitizes Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to &#946;&#8208;Lactam Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past decades, antibiotic resistance has grown to a point where orthogonal approaches to combating infections caused by resistant bacteria are needed. One such approach is the development of non&#8208;microbicidal small molecules that potentiate the activity of conventional antibiotics, termed adjuvants. We previously established that the diterpene natural product 12(S),16&#949;&#8208;Dihydroxycleroda&#8208;3,13&#8208;dien&#8208;15,16&#8208;olide, which we refer to as (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112 for short, synergizes with oxacillin against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To further explore this activity, (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112 was synthesized and the structure confirmed through X&#8208;ray analysis. Preliminary structure&#8208;activity relationship studies following the synthesis of several analogues identified key structural elements responsible for activity and indicate that scaffold simplification is possible. A preliminary mode of action study suggests mecA plays a role in the adjuvant activity of (&#8208;) LZ&#8208;2112.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptoid&#8208;Directed Formation of Five&#8208;Fold Twinned Au Nanostars through Particle Attachment and Facet Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While bio&#8208;inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8208;particle interactions is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8208;Au interaction, leading to synthesis of concave five&#8208;fold twinned, five&#8208;pointed Au nanostars  via  a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization.  Ex situ  and liquid&#8208;phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star&#8208;shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence&#8208;defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>The Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Generated Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the chemical synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers, we demonstrated for the first time, the protein&#8208;target mediated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;generated aptamers (EGAs). We prepared pre&#8208;polymerisation mixtures containing different ratios of nucleotides, an initiator sequence and protein template and incubated each mixture with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Upon purification and rebinding of the EGAs against the target, we observed an enhancement in binding of templated&#8208;EGAs against the target compared to a non&#8208;templated control. These results demonstrate the presence of two primary mechanisms for the formation of EGAs, namely, the binding of random sequences to the target as observed in systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and the dynamic competition between TdT enzyme and the target protein for binding of EGAs during synthesis. The latter mechanism serves to increase the stringency of EGA&#8208;based screening and represents a new way to develop aptamers that relies on rational design.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we reported a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct far&#8208;red and NIR fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the  meso  &#8208;positions of various fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (10  2  &#8211;10  3  &#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806 nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Single&#8208;Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tannic acid coating method, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic single&#8208;atom coatings (SACs) (e.&#8201;g., Co, Fe, Mn, Co&#8722;Mn, Fe&#8722;Mn) can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon cloth, SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm).







Abstract
Here, we report a universal single&#8208;atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon, SiO2, TiO2, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8211;dopamine complexes or metal&#8211;organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on graphene and TiO2 were prepared. The former one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single&#8208;atom coating&#8211;TiO2 heterojunction.

         <title>Operando Imaging of Chemical Activity on Gold Plates with Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship is of crucial importance to the evaluation and the rational design of novel catalysts. Herein, single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is employed for super&#8208;resolution mapping of the chemical activity and kinetic analysis of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;based reactions on single gold plates, which enables spatiotemporal characterizations down to the single&#8208;reaction level.







Abstract
Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical techniques are thus in high demand. Here, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)32+ based reactions on Au plates using single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single&#8208;entity chemistry, that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions. High spatial resolution, up to 37&#8197;nm, further enables mapping Au chemical activity and the reaction kinetics. The spatiotemporally resolved dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationship on Au plates shows that the restructuring of catalysts plays an important role in determining the reactivity. Our approach may lead to gaining new insights towards evaluating and designing electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Dibenzodiazapyracylenes: Doubly N&#8208;Doped Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Molecules That Exhibit High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrogen&#8208;doped CP&#8208;PAH, dibenzodiazapyracylene, was successfully synthesized and characterized. The aromatic and antiaromatic resonance hybrid characters have been verified by comparing their 1H&#8197;NMR spectra to those of reference molecules. Their condensed packing structures in the solid state allowed for the effective hole transporting.







Abstract
Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8722;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of dialdehydes led to structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes in good yields, with high enantioselectivity enabled by unprecedented NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes followed by kinetic resolution. This protocol, which features mild reaction conditions and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance, provides modular access to value&#8208;added axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.







Abstract
Axially chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor &#916;E was developed based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism, allowing the accurate predictions of organic host&#8211;guest phosphorescent systems.







Abstract
Although doping can induce room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;E to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with a high accuracy of 83&#8201;%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67&#8197;s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;E descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.

         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and programmable triple fluorescence switching in the solid state was demonstrated through an alternative &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; optical manipulation strategy employing a spiropyran&#8208;functionalized distyrylanthracene derivative. The unique switching ability enabled innovative multicolor, tunable, switching cell imaging and two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging in a single&#8208;molecule system.







Abstract
In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides was developed, and also combined with a cascade cyclization. Over 120 functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic investigations shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and ortho&#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were easily synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy were further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. Then, the asymmetric control of the radical reaction was attempted and proven feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Exposure of the Intrinsic Magnetic Surface of BaTiO3 to Give Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimensional defect structure of BaTiO3 with exposed intrinsic face of (1
0) has been prepared using supercritical CO2. It displays room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Preparation of low&#8208;dimensional ferromagnetic nanomaterials and investigation of their magnetic origin is critical to the exploration of novel materials with various applications such as data storage. Herein, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) BaTiO3 was successfully stripped to a low&#8208;dimensional structure by treating the materials with supercritical CO2 (SC CO2). Under different CO2 pressures, SC CO2 selectively cleaves the covalent bonds of the bulk BaTiO3, leading to the exposure of various surfaces. After SC CO2 treatments, the BaTiO3 exhibits room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, which is significantly stronger than conventional treatments. According to the experimental and theoretical investigations, the enhanced ferromagnetic property is attributed to the exposure of the intrinsic surfaces of BaTiO3.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold can be dissolved in a sustainable manner with common household chemicals: iodine solution in ethanol, resembling diluted iodine tincture, green oxidant hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, a compound used in medicinal applications. Catalytic reactions and green solvents are the basis for sustainable development and recycling of precious metals like gold.







Abstract
Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuII2]&#8722; species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand AuI complex. H2O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Tuned Molecular Packing Allows Concurrently Boosted Photoacoustic Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process to enhance the NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of an organic semiconducting nanoparticle concurrently by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times, respectively, is described by tuning the molecular packing in the aggregated state of NPs, which provides a new strategy to develop multi&#8208;modal phototheranostic materials for more capable clinical applications.







Abstract
It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single&#8208;molecule level. Herein, we reveal that BDTR9&#8208;OC8 and BDTR9&#8208;C8, which have identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones but are substituted by side chains of different rigidity, show distinct phototheranostic properties in the aggregated state. The NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of BDTR9&#8208;C8 nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times compared with BDTR9&#8208;OC8 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations and GIWAXS analysis revealed that BDTR9&#8208;C8 with rigid side chains shows a relative amorphous condensed state, which will benefit the efficient transportation of photo&#8208;generated excitons and phonons, subsequently enhancing the FLI and PAI signals. Besides, both nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong light&#8208;harvesting capability and are considered effective photothermal therapy materials. This work provides an illuminating strategy for material design in the future.

&lt;p&gt;A process to enhance the NIR-II FLI and PAI brightness of an organic semiconducting nanoparticle concurrently by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times, respectively, is described by tuning the molecular packing in the aggregated state of NPs, which provides a new strategy to develop multi-modal phototheranostic materials for more capable clinical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single-molecule level. Herein, we reveal that &lt;b&gt;BDTR9-OC8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BDTR9-C8&lt;/b&gt;, which have identical &#960;-conjugated backbones but are substituted by side chains of different rigidity, show distinct phototheranostic properties in the aggregated state. The NIR-II FLI and PAI brightness of &lt;b&gt;BDTR9-C8&lt;/b&gt; nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times compared with &lt;b&gt;BDTR9-OC8&lt;/b&gt; nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations and GIWAXS analysis revealed that &lt;b&gt;BDTR9-C8&lt;/b&gt; with rigid side chains shows a relative amorphous condensed state, which will benefit the efficient transportation of photo-generated excitons and phonons, subsequently enhancing the FLI and PAI signals. Besides, both nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong light-harvesting capability and are considered effective photothermal therapy materials. This work provides an illuminating strategy for material design in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism Processes in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of solid&#8208;state MAS NMR on live microalgae for monitoring of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamics changes is demonstrated. Conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids is observed, accompanied with rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. It is concluded that high cell densities, creating dark, anoxia conditions, induce lipid catabolism and cell death resulting in breakdown of cell and organelle membranes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8&#8201;% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using asymmetrically peripheral protection as a design motif, two high efficiency and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials were designed and synthesized. The corresponding device exhibits pure green emission with a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 32.8&#8201;% and relatively low efficiency roll&#8208;off without utilizing any sensitizer.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve a high PLQY of 96&#8201;% and a fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green devices with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.8&#8201;% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains a high EQE exceeding 23&#8201;% at a high luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.

         <title>Photoswitchable Molecular Communication between Programmable DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Membraneless Organelles</title>

         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable bi&#8208;directional trafficking of biomolecules between programmable DNA&#8208;based artificial membraneless organelles in a cell&#8208;like microcompartment has been achieved to imitate intracellular communication towards construction of advanced functional artificial cells.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal organization of distinct biological processes in cytomimetic compartments is a crucial step towards engineering functional artificial cells. Mimicking controlled bi&#8208;directional molecular communication inside artificial cells remains a considerable challenge. Here we present photoswitchable molecular transport between programmable membraneless organelle&#8208;like DNA coacervates in a synthetic microcompartment. We use droplet microfluidics to fabricate membraneless non&#8208;fusing DNA coacervates by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet, and employ the interior DNA coacervates as artificial organelles to imitate intracellular communication via photo&#8208;regulated uni&#8208; and bi&#8208;directional transfer of biomolecules. Our results highlight a promising new route to assembly of multicompartment artificial cells with functional networks.

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes.







Abstract
Probes featuring room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges around the microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. Herein, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with a RTP emission lasting for &#8776;5&#8197;s and a lifetime as long as 743.7&#8197;ms. We demonstrate that live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of &#8776;69 for in vitro imaging, and &#8776;627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8197;times.

         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Controllable Efficiency Enabled by an Annulene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Fluid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An annulene&#8208;based discotic liquid crystal (LC) material to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform is developed. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of the LC molecule with variable molecular order, the efficiency of the light&#8208;harvesting system can be controlled at different temperatures when Nile red is introduced as an acceptor. This system exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio.







Abstract
The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials, i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound 6 with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor.

&lt;p&gt;An annulene-based discotic liquid crystal (LC) material to construct a tunable light-harvesting platform is developed. Relying on the thermal-responsive self-assembling ability of the LC molecule with variable molecular order, the efficiency of the light-harvesting system can be controlled at different temperatures when Nile red is introduced as an acceptor. This system exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of controllable artificial light-harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials, i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene-based discotic LC compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with a saddle-shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light-harvesting platform. The LC material shows a typical aggregation-induced emission, which can act as a suitable light-harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light-harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal-responsive self-assembling ability of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;-NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light-harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000&#8201;:&#8201;1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100&#8201;:&#8201;1 donor/acceptor ratio.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecule Based High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Organic Material for Efficient Water Purification and Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umbrella&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor system (GDPA&#8208;QCN) based on a bulky dendritic donor (umbrella head) and a liner heterocyclic acceptor (umbrella handle) has been developed. GDPA&#8208;QCN shows strong sunlight absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion properties in the solid state and was employed to fabricate a high&#8208;performance water purification and electricity generation system.







Abstract
In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100&#8197;nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24&#8201;% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport behavior of two amine Cu porphyrin supramolecules with different stacking interactions in perovskite grain boundaries was investigated in detail. Results prove that the construction of homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in aromatic passivators is a key factor for the charge transport between perovskite grains. This work also affords a new strategy to design new optoelectronic materials with improved charge mobilities.







Abstract
Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have attracted considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules that probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in the perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the presence of a stronger interaction between the amine units and the central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules. This has a modified effect on the dipole direction of the porphyrins to be quantized as homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance to as high as 24.2&#8201;%. This work proves that the modulation of the intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Heteroaromatics with Prolonged Homogeneous Hexatomic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red multi&#8208;resonance emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields and narrowband emission were demonstrated by introducing homogeneous hexatomic rings into nitrogen&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting devices afforded state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency up to 18.2&#8201;% and superior operation stability.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic heteroaromatics have exhibited fascinating multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics for efficient narrowband emission, but strategies to bathochromic shift their emissions while maintaining the narrow bandwidths remain exclusive. Here, homogeneous hexatomic rings are introduced into nitrogen&#8208;embedded MR skeletons to prolong the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length for low&#8208;energy electronic transitions while retaining the non&#8208;bonding character of the remaining parts. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters exhibit near unity photoluminescence quantum yields with peaks at 598&#8197;nm and 620&#8197;nm and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximums of 28&#8197;nm and 31&#8197;nm, respectively. Optimal organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 18.2&#8201;%, negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, and ultra&#8208;long lifetime with negligible degradation at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 after 94&#8197;hours.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Variable Oxygen Affinity for Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;support interaction between Pt and CoOx creates a strong built&#8208;in electric field across the interface and modulates the charge distribution. This electric field subtly optimizes both the hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy, boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media.







Abstract
Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoOx electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.

A model for the damping of the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) was proposed by considering the mechanical resistance of the ligands. Correspondingly the hot carrier cooling process was slowed down by 3&#8208;fold in CsPbBr3 PeNCs by tuning the rigidity of the layer of organic capping ligands.







Abstract
In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.

         <title>Synergistic Hydrocobaltation and Borylcobaltation Enable Regioselective Migratory Triborylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed triborylation of unactivated alkenes is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and xantphos. Mechanistic studies reveal that this triborylation reaction proceeds through three interdependent catalytic cycles.







Abstract
The structural diversity of sp3&#8208;triorganometallic reagents enhances their potentiality in the modular construction of molecular complexity in chemical synthesis. Despite significant achievements on the preparation of sp3 1,1,1&#8208; and 1,1,2&#8208;triorganometallic B,B,B&#8208;reagents, catalytic approaches that enable the installation of multiple boryl groups at skipped carbons of unactivated alkenes still remain elusive. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective triborylation reaction of unactivated alkenes to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes. This triborylation protocol provides a general platform for regioselective trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes, and its utility is highlighted by the synthesis of various value&#8208;added chemicals from readily accessible unactivated alkenes. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and evaluation of potential reactive intermediates, provide insight into the experimentally observed chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Origin of High Diastereoselectivity in Reactions of Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselective reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates have been systematically investigated. Diastereoselectivity was found to be general for &#1013;&#8208;lactams, &#1013;&#8208;lactones, and cycloheptanones with various substituent patterns. Computational investigations provided insight into the origin of the diastereoselectivity. A model for predicting the stereochemistry of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolate alkylations is proposed.







Abstract
Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective. Diastereoselectivity was observed for a range of substrates, including lactam, lactone, and cyclic ketone derivatives. The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are distinguished by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Stiffening of Hydrogel Networks with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's So Clearly Visible: Hydrogels can be formed by exclusively visible&#8208;light irradiation with two colours of light, with each colour allowing mechanical stiffening of the gel independent of the order in which each colour is applied. Driven by mild [2+2] cycloadditions with halochromic properties, the photoreactivity of the reactions in water can be controlled by a photoacid generator.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce the wavelength&#8208;orthogonal crosslinking of hydrogel networks using two red&#8208;shifted chromophores, i.e. acrylpyerene (AP, &#955;activation=410&#8211;490&#8197;nm) and styrylpyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine (SPP, &#955;activation=400&#8211;550&#8197;nm), able to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition in the visible&#8208;light regime. The photoreactivity of the SPP moiety is pH&#8208;dependent, whereby an acidic environment inhibits the cycloaddition. By employing a spiropyran&#8208;based photoacid generator with suitable absorption wavelength, we are able to restrict the activation wavelength of the SPP moiety to the green light region (&#955;activation=520&#8211;550&#8197;nm), enabling wavelength&#8208;orthogonal activation of the AP group. Our wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photochemical system was successfully applied in the design of hydrogels whose stiffness can be tuned independently by either green or blue light.

         <title>Triphase Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Silver&#8208;Decorated Titanium Oxide at a Gas&#8208;Water Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive process to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals. But this reaction is often restricted by the poor mass transfer of CO2 in the liquid phase. Here, we developed a triphase photocatalytic CO2RR system by supporting Ag&#8208;decorated TiO2 nanoparticles at a gas&#8208;water boundary with hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic abrupt interfacial wettability. Such a triphase system allows the rapid delivery of gas&#8208;phase CO2 to the surface of photocatalysts while maintaining an efficient water supply and uncovered active sites. Ag&#8208;TiO2 supported at the gas&#8208;water boundary showed a CO2 reduction rate of 305.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, without hole scavengers, approximately 8 times higher than the nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid phase. Even using diluted CO2 (10%) as the reactant, the CO2RR activity was superior to most reported Ag&#8208;TiO2 based photocatalysts using pure CO2. The findings provide a general strategy to promote the interfacial CO2 mass transfer to improve photoactivity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Acridinium Salts by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Cyclization of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Iminiums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinone methides are fundamental intermediates for a wide range of reactions in which catalyst stereocontrol is often achieved by hydrogen bonding. Herein, we describe the feasibility of an intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclization through  ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums stereocontrolled by a contact ion pair. A disulfonimide catalyst activates racemic trichloroacetimidate substrates and imparts stereocontrol in the cyclization step, providing a new avenue for selective  ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminium functionalization. A highly stereospecific oxidation readily transforms the enantioenriched acridanes into rotationally restricted acridiniums. Upon ion exchange, the method selectively affords atropisomeric acridinium tetrafluoroborate salts in high yields and an enantioenrichment of up to 93:7 e.r. We envision that ion&#8208;pairing catalysis over  ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums enables the selective synthesis of a diversity of heterocycles and aniline derivatives with distinct stereogenic units.</dc:description>

We envision that ion-pairing catalysis over  ortho-quinone methide iminiums enables the selective synthesis of a diversity of heterocycles and aniline derivatives with distinct stereogenic units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Two&#8208;phase Approach to Fusicoccane Synthesis To Uncover a Compound That Reduces Tumourigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alterbrassicicene D (  1  ) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (  2  ) were synthesised  via  a two&#8208;phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5&#8208;8&#8208;5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base&#8208;mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of  2  . The route is scalable and we generated 15 g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (  R  )&#8208;limonene and 720 mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of  2  and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC&#8208;1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour&#8208;initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;shifting molecules: unveiling the valence tautomerism phenomena in bare barbaralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic study of an archetypical barbaralone, conclusively revealing the valence tautomerism phenomena for this bistable molecular system. The two distinct 1&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted valence tautomers have been isolated in a supersonic expansion for the first time and successfully characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy. This work provides irrefutable experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement in barbaralones and highlights the use of rotational spectroscopy to analyze shape&#8208;shifting mixtures. Moreover, this observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in the isolation conditions of the gas phase and should serve as a reference point in the general understanding of valence tautomerism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The chiral  N&#8208;  substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol motif is found in many natural and synthetic bioactive compounds. In this study, enzymatic asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethyl ketones with enantiocomplementary IREDs enabled the synthesis of chiral  N  &#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent  ee  values (91&#8211;99%) in moderate to high yields (41&#8211;84%). Furthermore, a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step enzymatic process involving benzaldehyde lyase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of aldehydes and subsequent asymmetric reductive amination was developed, offering an environmentally friendly and economical way to produce of  N&#8208;  substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from readily available simple aldehydes and amines. This methodology was then applied to rapidly access a key synthetic intermediate of anti&#8208;malaria and cytotoxic tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Lithography in Single&#8208;Component Organic Enantiomorphic Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics are flexible, lightweight, and bio&#8208;friendly, promising for bio&#8208;harmonized electronic devices, while their ferroelectric lithography remains relatively unexplored. Here, by introducing the homochirality and ZE photoisomerization, we obtained a pair of organic enantiomorphic ferroelectrics, di(benzylamino)&#8208;substituted derivative of muconic acids, the first ferroelectrics in muconic family. Their ferroelectric and chiral features were confirmed by the polarization&#8722;electric field hysteresis loops and circular dichroism spectra, respectively. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements demonstrate that desired domain structure can be precisely achieved by applying a local electric field on a predefined pattern in their thin films. Moreover, thermogravimetric analyses reveal that their ferroelectricity can persist up to above 550 K. The precise pattern lithography and excellent thermal stability make them competitive candidates for ferroelectric lithography.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Elastomers from Stereochemistry&#8208;Directed Hydrogen Bonding in Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The remarkable elasticity and tensile strength found in natural elastomers are challenging to mimic. Synthetic elastomers typically feature covalently crosslinked networks (rubbers), but this hinders their reprocessability. Physical crosslinking via hydrogen bonding or ordered crystallite domains can afford reprocessable elastomers, but often at the cost of performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;tough, reprocessable elastomers based on linear alternating polymers. The incorporation of a rigid isohexide adjacent to urethane moieties affords elastomers with exceptional strain hardening, strain rate dependent behavior, and high optical clarity. Distinct differences were observed between isomannide and isosorbide&#8208;based elastomers where the latter displays superior tensile strength and strain recovery. These phenomena are attributed to the regiochemical irregularities in the polymers arising from their distinct stereochemistry and respective inter&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of H  2  O  2  from water and air via a photosynthetic approach is ideal for efficient small&#8208;scale production. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2e  &#8208;  water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H  2  O  2  production. Herein we have prepared a bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF&#8208;TfpBpy) for H  2  O  2  production in simple water and air mixture. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298K and 333K is 0.57% and 1.08% respectively, which is higher than the current reported highest value. The photocatalytic H  2  O  2  solution is sufficient to degrade pollutants. Mechanism study revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity is due to the protonation of bipyridine monomer which is promoted the rate&#8208;determining step (2e  &#8208;  WOR), and then enhances the yeager&#8208;type oxygen adsorption to accelerate 2e  &#8208;  one&#8208;step oxygen reduction. This work represents the very first COF for hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis from water and air. It paves the way for wastewater treatment using photocatalytic H  2  O  2  solution.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preparation of H  2  O  2  from water and air via a photosynthetic approach is ideal for efficient small-scale production. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2e  -  water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H  2  O  2  production. Herein we have prepared a bipyridine-based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF-TfpBpy) for H  2  O  2  production in simple water and air mixture. The solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298K and 333K is 0.57% and 1.08% respectively, which is higher than the current reported highest value. The photocatalytic H  2  O  2  solution is sufficient to degrade pollutants.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly Induced Solid&#8208;State Stacking Transformation in Amino Acid&#8208;Based Crystals with Enhanced Physical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The physical characteristics of supramolecular assemblies&#160;composed of small building blocks are dictated by molecular packing patterns in the solid&#8208;state. Yet, the structure&#8208;property correlation is still not fully understood. Herein, we report the unexpected cofacial to herringbone stacking transformation of a small aromatic bipyridine through co&#8208;assembly with acetylated glutamic acid. The unique solid&#8208;state structural transformation results in enhanced physical properties of the supramolecular organizations. The co&#8208;assembly methodology was further expanded to obtain diverse molecular packings by different bipyridine and acetylated amino acid derivatives. This study presents a feasible co&#8208;assembly approach to achieve the solid&#8208;state stacking transformation of supramolecular organization and opens up new opportunities to further explore the relationship between molecular arrangement and properties of supramolecular assemblies by crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Elastic Organic Crystals that Respond to Aerial Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight, mechanically reinforced, hygroresponsive organic crystalline hybrid materials has been synthesized by a universally applicable approach. The crystals are robust, durable, and moisture&#8208;absorbing, and show a highly linear deformation over a wide range of relative humidity. Such precise spatiotemporal control over the light output in response to air humidity allows the materials to be used as optical waveguides.







Abstract
Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity&#8208;responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks self&#8208;assembled from metal&#8211;nucleobase complexes and hexafluoro anions are reported by Wei Zhou, Zongbi&#8197;B. Bao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117609). Amino&#8208;rich ligands provided multiple H&#8208;bonding sites to stabilize the frameworks. In the confined channels, the electron&#8208;rich anions combined with the electron&#8208;deficient purine rings generate a micro&#8208;electric field to polarize and lock Xe atoms, thus achieving highly efficient Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions.

         <title>Alkylgold(III) Complexes Undergo Unprecedented Photo&#8208;Induced &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination and Reduction for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporally controllable activation of prodrugs within tumors is highly desirable for cancer therapy to minimize toxic side effects. Herein we report that stable alkylgold(III) complexes can undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, releasing alkyl ligands and forming gold(III)&#8208;hydride intermediates that could be quickly converted into bioactive [Au(III)&#8208;S] adducts; meanwhile, the remaining alkylgold(III) complexes can photo&#8208;catalytically reduce [Au(III)&#8208;S] into more bioactive Au(I) species. Such photo&#8208;reactivities make it possible to functionalize gold complexes on the auxiliary alkyl ligands without attenuating the metal&#8208;biomacromolecule interactions. As a result, the gold(III) complexes containing glucose&#8208;functionalized alkyl ligands displayed efficient and tumor&#8208;selective uptake; notably, after one&#8208; or two&#8208;photon activation, the complexes displayed high TrxR inhibition, potent cytotoxicity, and strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of Secondary and Tertiary Fluorides from &#946;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine is a critical element for the design of bioactive compounds, driving advances in selective and sustainable fluorination. However, stereogenic tertiary fluorides pose a synthetic challenge and are thus present in only a few approved drugs (fluticasone, solithromycin, and sofosbuvir). The aldol reaction of fluorinated donors provides an atom&#8208;economical approach to asymmetric C&#8208;F motifs via C&#8208;C bond formation. We report that the type II pyruvate aldolase HpcH and engineered variants perform addition of &#223;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketoacids (including fluoropyruvate, &#223;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketobutyrate, and &#223;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ketovalerate) to diverse aldehydes. The reactivity of HpcH towards these fluoro&#8208;donors grants access to enantiopure secondary or tertiary fluorides. In addition to representing the first synthesis of tertiary fluorides via biocatalytic carboligation, the afforded products could improve the diversity of fluorinated building blocks and enable the synthesis of fluorinated drug analogs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorine is a critical element for the design of bioactive compounds, driving advances in selective and sustainable fluorination. However, stereogenic tertiary fluorides pose a synthetic challenge and are thus present in only a few approved drugs (fluticasone, solithromycin, and sofosbuvir). The aldol reaction of fluorinated donors provides an atom-economical approach to asymmetric C-F motifs via C-C bond formation. We report that the type II pyruvate aldolase HpcH and engineered variants perform addition of &#223;-fluoro-&#945;-ketoacids (including fluoropyruvate, &#223;-fluoro-&#945;-ketobutyrate, and &#223;-fluoro-&#945;-ketovalerate) to diverse aldehydes.

         <title>Single Cell Imaging of Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;driven Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photodynamic therapy driven by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). The luminescence generated by Ru(bpy)32+ and co&#8208;reactant tripropylamine (TPA) pair acts as both optical readout for ECL imaging, and light source for the excitation of photosensitizer to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) system. The ECL&#8208;driven PDT (ECL&#8208;PDT) relies on the effective energy transfer from ECL emission to photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which sensitizes the surrounding O2 into ROS. The dynamic process of gradual morphological changes, the variation of cell&#8208;matrix adhesions, as well as the increase of cell membrane permeability in the process of ECL&#8208;PDT were monitored under ECL microscopy (ECLM) with good spatiotemporal resolution. Combining real&#8208;time imaging with ECL&#8208;PDT, this new strategy provides not only new insights into dynamic cellular processes, but also promising potential of ECL in clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;Au(III) transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.</dc:description>

The iron guanidine catalyst shows extraordinary copolymerization activities towards lactide, glycolide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, as reported by Sonja Herres&#8208;Pawlis, Moshe Kol et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112853). Depending on the reaction temperature and the mode of monomer addition, it either forms up to pentablock copolymers in a highly defined way or promotes transesterifications to such a high degree that random copolymers are produced. Therefore it is a rare example of a catalyst mastering both microstructures: ordered and chaotic.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Molecular Species in Carbon Nanodot Samples Disclosing Flaws</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanodots are currently one of the hot topics in the nanomaterials world, due to their accessible synthesis and promising features. However, the purification of these materials is still a critical aspect, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of unreacted species or small organic molecules formed during solvothermal treatments can affect the properties of the synthesized nanomaterials. To illustrate the extreme importance of this issue, we present two case studies in which insufficient purification results in misleading conclusions regarding the chiral and fluorescent properties of the investigated materials. Key to identify molecular species is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance, which proves to be an effective tool. Our work highlights the need to include nuclear magnetic resonance as a standard characterization technique for carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, to minimize the risk of observing properties that arise from molecular species, rather than the target carbon nanodots.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugate&#8208;Driven Electron Density Delocalization of Piperidine Nitroxyl Radical for Stable Aqueous Zinc Hybrid Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable and soluble redox&#8208;active nitroxyl radicals are highly desired for high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc hybrid flow batteries (AZHFBs). Here we report a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8221; conjugated imidazolium and &#8220;p&#8208;&#960;&#8221; conjugated acetylamino co&#8208;functionalized 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO) as stable catholyte for AZHFBs. The incorporation of double&#8208;conjugate substituents could delocalize electron density of N&#8208;O head and thus remarkably stabilize the radical and oxoammonium forms of TEMPO, avoiding the side reaction of ring&#8208;opening. Consequently, the applied MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO/Zn AZHFB demonstrates the hardly time&#8208;dependent stability with a constant capacity retention of 99.95%/day over 16.7 days at high concentration catholyte of 1.5 M and high current density of 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  . This proposed molecular engineering strategy on electron density regulation of redox&#8208;active structures displays an attractive efficacy and thus represents a remarkable advance in high&#8208;performance AZHFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Chemically Responsive Switchable Gas Valves with Protonation&#8208;Induced Liquid Gating Self&#8208;Adaptive Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide (CO2  ) capture and storage technologies are promising to limit  CO2  emission  from anthropogenic activities, to achieve carbon neutrality goals. CO2  capture requires to separate CO2  from other gases, and therefore a gas flow system that exhibits discernible gating behaviors for CO2  would provide the usefulness. Here we propose a  self&#8208;adaptive CO2  gas valve  composed of chemically responsive liquid gating systems. The transmembrane critical pressures of the liquid gate vary upon the presence of CO2  , due to the superamphiphiles assembled by Poly(propylene glycol) bis(2&#8208;aminopropyl ether) and oleic acid in  gating liquid  s that protonated specifically by  CO2  . It is shown that the valve can perform self&#8208;adaptive regulation for specific gases and different CO2  concentrations. This protonation&#8208;induced liquid gating mechanism will open a potential platform for the application of  CO2  separators, detectors, sensors and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscopic Mechanism of the Heat&#8208;Induced Blueshift in Phosphors and A Logarithmic Energy Dependence on the Nearest Dopant&#8208;Vacancy Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heat induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that remains unexplained for decades. By using the high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations and energy screening technique, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li  3  SiO  4  ]  2  :Eu  2+  , Na[Li  3  SiO  4  ]:Eu  2+  , K[Li  3  SiO  4  ]:Eu  2+  , Sr[LiAl  3  N  4  ]:Eu  2+  , and Ca[LiAl  3  N  4  ]:Eu  2+  . Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal&#8208;cation vacancy. By identifying the 5d&#8594;4f transition energies from the electronic structures calculated from the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu  2+  ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical defect&#8208;driven response on graphene&#8208;based chemiresistors for sub&#8208;ppm ammonia detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas sensors are essential in several fields and, in general, features such as high sensitivity, quick response, and fast recovery are required, along with low power consumption and low cost. Graphene is considered a promising material for gas sensing applications, its functionalization often being a requisite. In the present study, we developed competitive and promising gas sensors for ammonia detection. Interestingly, we present an easy and efficient method to functionalize graphene by using diazonium chemistry with different functional groups. Moreover, we prove the superior sensing capability of our covalently modified graphene layers. These experimental data have been consistently interpreted by theoretical calculations, which reveal a defect&#8208;driven sensor&#8217;s response to ammonia. These results open the possibility of a comprehensive design and use of these graphene&#8208;based sensors in real applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Auto&#8208;Tandem Palladium Catalysis for 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Carbonates: Ligand&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new asymmetric auto&#8208;tandem catalysis processes, especially in a divergent manner, is highly attractive but extremely challenging. Presented herein is a palladium catalyzed auto&#8208;tandem reaction between 2,4&#8208;dienyl carbonates and o&#8208;TsNH arylimines or trifluoroacetophenones that proceeded through a consecutive N&#8208;allylation, vinylogous addition, &#960;&#8208;&#963;&#8208;&#960; isomerization, and another N&#8208;allylation sequence. Importantly, switchable diastereo&#8208;divergent synthesis could be achieved by tuning the chiral bisphosphine ligands, and a broad spectrum of fused tetrahydro&#8208;quinoline architectures was constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Even regiodivergent azetidine or chemodivergent &#946;&#8208;H elimination derivatives, with fair enantioselectivity, could be effectively accessed via ligand&#8208;control, further showing the versatility of the current auto&#8208;tandem catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A platform for stop flow gradient generation to investigate chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of artificial microswimmers to respond to external stimuli and the mechanistical details of their origins belong to the most disputed challenges in interdisciplinary science. Therein, the creation of chemical gradients is technically challenging, because
they quickly level out due to diffusion. Inspired by pivotal stopped ow experiments in chemical kinetics, we show that microfluidics gradient generation combined with a pressure feedback loop for precisely controlling the stop of the flows, can enable us to study
mechanistical details of chemotaxis of artificial Janus micromotors, based on a catalytic reaction. We find that these copper Janus
particles display a chemotactic motion along the concentration gradient in both, positive and negative direction and we demonstrate
the mechanical reaction of the particles to unbalanced drag forces, explaining this behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Durable Intraoperative Near&#8208;infrared Imaging of Ovarian Cancer Using Ultrabright Squaraine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The residual tumor after surgery is the most significant prognostic factor of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery is actively utilized for tumor localization and complete resection during surgery. However, currently available contrast&#8208;enhancing agents display low on&#8208;target binding, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, thus not ideal for clinical use. Here we report ultrabright and stable squaraine fluorophores with optimal pharmacokinetics by introducing an asymmetric molecular conformation and surface charges for rapid transporter&#8208;mediated cellular uptake. Among the tested, OCTL14 shows low serum binding and rapid distribution into cancer tissue  via  organic cation transporters (OCTs). Additionally, the charged squaraine fluorophores are retained in lysosomes, providing durable intraoperative imaging in a preclinical murine model of ovarian cancer up to 24 h post&#8208;injection. OCTL14 represents a significant departure from the current bioconjugation approach of using a non&#8208;targeted fluorophore and would provide surgeons with an indispensable tool to achieve optimal resection.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Controlled Polymerization of Bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;Caprolactone toward Fully Recyclable Polyesters and Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end-of-use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time-consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of bio-sourced &#948;-caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l-lactide (l-LA) affords well-defined PLLA-b-P&#948;CL-b-PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA-b-P&#948;CL-b-PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochromism of Nanographenes in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographene (NG) is a potential candidate for organic EC materials because of its large&#160;p&#160;conjugated system, chemical stability, absorption band covering the visible region, and tunable optical properties by postsynthetic modification. We show that NGs carrying redox active triphenylamine (TPA) units covalently linked to the NG edge function as EC materials in the NIR region. The hybrid materials can be obtained by the installation of TPA units onto the NG edge and display changes in the absorption spectrum in the NIR region extending to a wavelength of over 2000 nm upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction at low potentials (&lt; 1.1 V). Time&#8208;dependent unrestricted density functional theory calculation of a model NG at the UB3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d,p) level of theory suggests that a narrow energy gap between the basal plane and the oxidized TPA unit is responsible for the observed EC function in the NIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles&#160;as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide&#160;Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of nitrous oxide, N2O,&#160;via&#160;NH3&#160;oxidation is not in practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced&#160;via&#160;thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2&#8209;supported Au nanoparticles (2&#8209;3&#160;nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low&#8209;temperature NH3&#160;oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space&#8209;time yield than the state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art Mn&#8209;Bi/&#945;&#8209;Al2O3&#160;and remarkable stability over 70&#160;h on stream. The reaction proceeds&#160;via&#160;a Mars&#8209;Van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Au&#948;+&#160;species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2&#160;identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3&#160;oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization as a green and selective oxidant.</dc:description>

X&#8208;ray absorption/photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation results   indicate that Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bonding can facilitate the distorted coordinated structure of Ni site with short nickel&#8208;oxygen bond and low coordination number, and can promote the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density   to efficiently regulate the adsorption behavior of key intermediates with near&#8208;optimal d&#8208;band center.  Here the Fe&#8208;doped&#8208;(Ni&#8208;MOFs)/FeOOH with interfacial Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bonding shows superior catalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210 mV at 15 mA cm&#8208;2  and excellent stability with ~3% attenuation after 120 h cycle test.

         <title>Predicting solubility of ion pairs in aqueous inorganic chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs), ranging in size from several to 100&#8217;s of &#229;ngstr&#246;ms, represent building blocks of inorganic materials. Elucidating their complex solubility behavior with alkali countercations can inform and model natural and synthetic processes in aqueous media. In the study of POMs ([Nb  24  O  72  H  9  ]  15&#8722;  , Nb  24  ) we discovered an unusual solubility trend (termed anomalous solubility) of alkali&#8208;POMs, in which Nb  24  is most soluble with the smallest (Li  +  ) and largests (Rb/Cs  +  ) alkalis, and least soluble with Na/K  +  . Via computation, we define a descriptor (&#963;&#8208;profile) and use an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict all three described alkali&#8208;anion solubility trends: amphoteric, normal (Li  +  &gt; Na  +  &gt; K  +  &gt; Rb  +  &gt; Cs  +  ), and anomalous (Cs  +  &gt;Rb  +  &gt;K  +  &gt;Na  +  &gt;Li  +  ). Testing predicted amphoteric solubility along with X&#8208;ray scattering and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies affirmed the accuracy of the desciptor, provided solution&#8208;phase snapshots of alkali&#8208;POM interactions, yielded a new POM formulated [Ti  6  Nb  14  O  54  ]  14&#8208;  , and provided guidlines to exploit alkali&#8208;POM interactions for new POMs discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cy&#8208;cloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the  K  &#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its  1  H NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assembly of Coordination Macromolecules with Atypical Geometries: Gd44Co28 Crown and Gd95Co60 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovered giant clusters are always highly symmetric owing to the spontaneous assembly of one or two basic units.

The heart&#8208;like units and crown&#8208;like tetramer found in both compounds indicate unprecedented assembly levels, leading to an atypical geometry characteristic compared to the giant clusters directly assembled by regular units. These two clusters not only significantly increase the size of Ln&#8208;Co clusters but also exhibit the enhanced magnetic entropy change at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. This work provided an effective way to fabricate cluster compounds with giant size and geometry complexity simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>From Structural Design to Functional Construction: Amine Molecules in High&#8208;Performance FA&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based perovskites have been considered as one of the most promising light&#8208;absorbing perovskite materials owing to their narrower bandgap and better thermal stability compared to the conventional methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Constant improvement by using various additives stimulates the potential application of these perovskites. As the typical additives, amine molecules with different structures have been widely used in FA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells and decent performances have been achieved. Thus, a systematical review focusing on structural regulation and functional construction of amines in FA&#8208;based perovskites is of significance. Herein, we analyze the construction mechanism of different structural amines on the functional perovskite crystals. The influences of amine molecules on the specific perovskite properties including defect condition, charge transfer, and moisture resistance are evaluated. Finally, we summarize the design rules of amine molecules for the application in high&#8208;performance FA&#8208;based perovskite and propose directions for the future development of additive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Cyanopyridylalanine for In&#8208;Cell Protein Macrocyclization by the Nitrile&#8211;Aminothiol Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic encoded cyanopyridylalanines are presented as convenient and highly selective reactive groups for in vivo functionalization, cyclization and stapling of polypeptides. The non&#8208;toxic compounds can be genetically incorporated into proteins with high yields and their biocompatible reaction with amino&#8208;thiol moieties proceeds under physiological conditions to near completion without requiring a catalyst.







Abstract
Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of meta&#8208; and para&#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, ii)&#8197;in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and iii)&#8197;protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific in vivo protein modifications in complex biological environments.

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous intercalation is proposed here as a promising strategy to activate the enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of layered MoO3 nanobelts for the generation of reactive oxygen species including &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; in a tumor microenvironment, making it an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy.







Abstract
The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3&#8722;x (NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x) nanobelts. In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8722;MoO3&#8722;x nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.

         <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;ion battery: Ascribed to the improved anion intercalation performance in the graphite cathode and reversible Ca2+ insertion in the organic anode, by combining a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated Ca&#8208;ion electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results for Ca&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.

         <title>Binary Solvent Regulated Architecture of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Polarization for Highly&#8208;Selective Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with controlled open coplanar carboxyl oxygen atoms within the pores have been constructed through an adaptable binary solvent synthetic strategy. Activated HOFs with enhanced surface polarization show highly selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 based on differences of molecule polarizability.







Abstract
A binary solvent synthetic strategy is proposed for the construction of C2&#8208;symmetric molecule&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with permanent ultra&#8208;micropores and surface polarization derived from tunable coplanar open oxygen atoms. The activated HOFs BTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a and PTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a show highly selective separation of CO2/N2 with a record high ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity &gt;2000 under ambient temperature and pressure.

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing robust orthogonal and directional bonding lays the foundation for the construction of finite DNA origami superstructures with complex shapes. By employing a twelve&#8208;valence hexagonal prism DNA origami as the building block, versatile superstructures were obtained from different combinations of building blocks with appropriate valences. All of these superstructures are fully addressable and could guide the assembly of guest molecules to produce functional devices.







Abstract
Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it will facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Addition of Aryl Iodides across Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioenriched alcohols comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. Here, we first report that chiral nickel complexes can catalyze the intermolecular enantioselective addition of aryl iodides across aldehydes to provide diverse optically active secondary alcohols using zinc metal as the reducing agent. This method shows a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions and precludes the traditional strategy through the pregeneration of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic studies indicate that an in situ formed arylnickel, instead of an arylzinc, adds efficiently to aldehydes, forming a new C&#8722;C bond and a chiral nickel alkoxide that may be turned over by zinc powder.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboranes are boron&#8208;carbon molecular clusters, possessing unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content and a delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications to supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents and organometallic coordination chemistry. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for oxidative carborane cage activation. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. Only in the recent few years, considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will play an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of an intermolecular thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene coupling reaction is reported for the one&#8208;pot construction of C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bonds. This opens a new dimension in building molecular complexity to access densely functionalized products. The progress was achieved by suppressing hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and associative reductant upconversion (via associative electron upconversion C&#8208;S three&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;bond formation) using an Eosin Y/DBU/MeOH photocatalytic system. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combining online ESI&#8208;UHRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling, determination of quantum yield and computational modeling revealed a unique photoredox cycle with four radical&#8208;involving stages. Previously unavailable products of the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reaction were obtained in good yields with high selectivity and can serve as stable precursors for the synthesis of synthetically demanding activated 1,3&#8208;dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores harnessed by the pathways of photoinduced counterion migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the emerging field of intramolecular charge transfer induced counterion migration, we report the new insights into photophysical features of luminescent donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;)  n  A  +  [X  &#8211;  ] (&#960; = &#8211;(C  6  H  4  )  x  &#8211;). The unique connectivity of the phosphorus atom affords multipolar molecules with variable number of arms and the electronic properties of the acceptor group. In the ion paired form, the transition from dipolar to quadrupolar configuration enhances the low energy migration&#8208;induced band by providing the additional pathways for anion motion. The multipolar architecture, adjustable lengths of the &#960;&#8208;spacers and the nature of counterions allow for efficient tuning the emission and achieving nearly pure white light with quantum yields around 30%. The methyl substituent at the phosphorus atom reduces the rate of ion migration and suppresses the red shifted bands, simultaneously improving total emission intensity. The results unveil the harness of multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores by anion migration via structure and branching of donor&#8208;acceptor arms.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Molecules Convert Commercial Fluorophores into Tailored Functional Probes during Bio&#8208;labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many life&#8208;science techniques and assays rely on selective labelling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super&#8208;resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during bio&#8208;labelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of bio&#8208;labelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well&#8208;established labelling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi&#8208;four component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation&#8208; and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon&#8208;rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets  in vitro  and  in vivo  via thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye, can become a photostable self&#8208;healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self&#8208;healing linker&#8208;fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many life-science techniques and assays rely on selective labelling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super-resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during bio-labelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of bio-labelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well-established labelling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi-four component reaction (Ugi-4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation- and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon-rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets  in vitro  and  in vivo  via thiol-maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye, can become a photostable self-healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self-healing linker-fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super-resolution imaging and single-molecule spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.</dc:description>
