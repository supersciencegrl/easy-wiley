         <title>Amide&#8208;Directed Highly Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Diverse Acyclic Multisubstituted Alkenes Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted alkenes to form 1,2&#8208;contiguous stereocenters is a particularly appealing but highly challenging transformation in asymmetric catalysis. Despite the notable progress achieved in enantioselective hydrogenation over the past decades, enantioselective hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes containing multiple alkyl groups remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of diverse acyclic multisubstituted alkenes under mild conditions. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center generates a highly active catalyst that effectively overcomes the low reactivity of substrates and precisely controls the stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalyst system is exemplified by its efficacy across at least three types of alkenes including &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and enamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Activated B&#8208;Doping for Efficient 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction through Suppressing H2O2 Decomposition at High Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) has emerged as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. Although oxidized carbon catalysts have intensive developed due to their high selectivity and activity, the yield and conversion rate of H2O2 under high overpotential still limited. The produced H2O2 was rapidly consumed by the increased intensity of H2O2 reduction, which could ascribe to decomposition of peroxide radicals under high voltage in the carbon catalyst. To overcome this issue, a B doped carbon have been developed to catalyze 2e&#8208; ORR with high efficient through suppressing H2O2 decomposition at high potential. Thus, thermal reducing of oxygen containing groups (OCGs) on graphite could construct defects and vacancies, which in situ convert to B&#8208;Cx subunits on the edge of graphene sheets. The introduction of B&#8208;Cx effectively prevented the decomposition of the *O&#8208;O bond and provided suitable adsorption capacity for *OOH, achieving excellent selectivity for the 2e&#8208; ORR across a wide voltage range. Finally, a remarkable H2O2 yield of 7.91 mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 was delivered at an industrial current density of 600 mA cm&#8722;2, which could provide &#8220;green&#8221; pathway for scale&#8208;upable synthesis H2O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing SPAN in Non&#8208;Flammable Acetonitrile Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Graphite||SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a nonflammable acetonitrile (AN)&#8208;based electrolyte for safe SPAN batteries for the first time. We first identified the irreversible cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds of SPAN as the main reason for the failure of SPAN in conventional AN electrolyte. We further demonstrated fluoroethylene carbonate additive could avoid the structure deterioration of SPAN in conventional AN electrolyte by inhibiting the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds, suppressing the transformation from SPAN to elemental sulfur, and forming uniform solid electrolyte interface on the surface of SPAN. With the newly&#8208;formulated electrolyte, excellent cycling stability and high safety are obtained in both Li||SPAN and Gr||SPAN cells. The present exploitation broadens the electrolyte choices for SPAN cathodes and promises the practical applications of SPAN batteries.







Abstract
Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) presents an opportunity to replace elemental sulfur as a &#8220;shuttle&#8208;free&#8221; cathode for secondary Li&#8722;S batteries, which can be an ideal choice for stationary energy storage due to its abundance, low cost, and sustainability. The electrolyte options for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SPAN batteries have been limited to the flammable carbonate and ether ones, which raises safety concerns. Here, we explored the use of a non&#8208;flammable acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte for SPAN battery for the first time and identified the irreversible cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds of SPAN as the main reason for the failure of SPAN in AN electrolyte. Fortunately, by introducing 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% fluoroethylene carbonate into the AN electrolyte, the bond cleavage in SPAN is suppressed and a stable cathode electrolyte interface is formed, both contributing to stabilizing the structure of SPAN during electrochemical process. Consequently, we achieved a stable cycling for 900&#8197;cycles in Li||SPAN cells. Moreover, by pairing with a pre&#8208;lithiated graphite (pGr) anode, the newly formulated electrolyte enables extended cycle life for 1500&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 91&#8201;% and superb safety in pGr||SPAN full cell. The present exploitation broadens the electrolyte choices of SPAN&#8208;based batteries and paves the way for future applications for these batteries.

         <title>Pooled Nanoparticle Screening Using a Chemical Barcoding Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl halide&#8208;based small molecule barcodes (halocodes) are used for pooled quantification of polymeric and liposomal nanoparticles in vitro and ex vivo. Halocodes are compatible with multiple classes of nanocarriers and have modular attachment, extensive parameter space, and low limits of detection with mass spectrometry&#8208;based technologies. This work demonstrates a promising new nanoparticle barcoding technology to expedite nanoparticle screening.







Abstract
We report the development of a small molecule&#8208;based barcoding platform for pooled screening of nanoparticle delivery. Using aryl halide&#8208;based tags (halocodes), we achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection via gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or electron capture. This enables barcoding and tracking of nanoparticles with minimal halocode concentrations and without altering their physicochemical properties. To demonstrate the utility of our platform for pooled screening, we synthesized a halocoded library of polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles and quantified uptake in ovarian cancer cells in a pooled manner. Our findings correlate with conventional fluorescence&#8208;based assays. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of halocodes for spatial mapping of nanoparticles using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Halocoding presents an accessible and modular nanoparticle screening platform capable of quantifying delivery of pooled nanocarrier libraries in a range of biological settings.

         <title>Striking Impact of Solvent Polarity on the Strength of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes: A Nexus Between Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional belief that the stability of H&#8208;bonded complexes decreases in a more polar solvent is being questioned in this study. Our analysis indicates that the stability of neutral H&#8208;bonded complexes increases in a more polar solvent, provided there is substantial charge transfer between the subsystems. Experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation and periodic metadynamics methods confirm the findings.







Abstract
The binding free energy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes is generally inversely proportional to the solvent dielectric constant. This occurs because the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the complex is always smaller than that of the individual subsystems, leading to a reduction in solvation energy. The present study explores the potential for stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes in a solvent with higher polarity. Contrary to the established understanding, we have demonstrated that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex (CH3CH2COOH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine) can be better stabilized in a solvent with higher polarity. In this case, a significant charge transfer between the subsystems results in an increased dipole moment of the complex, leading to its stabilization in a more polar solvent. The expected inverse relationship between binding free energy and solvent dielectric constant is observed when the charge transfer between the subsystems is low. Thus, the magnitude of the charge transfer between subsystems is possibly the key factor in determining the stabilization or destabilization of H&#8208;bonded complexes in different solvents. Here, we present a comprehensive study that combines experimental and theoretical approaches, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations to validate the findings.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reinforced &#8220;Microglia Energy Modulator&#8221; for Synergistic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>

         <dc:description>
A mutually reinforcing microglia energy modulator is developed by repurposing lonidamine and hollow mesoporous Prussian blue for synergistic clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's disease. The modulator improves microglial phagocytic function, decreases amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits, mitigates neuroinflammation, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.







Abstract
Microglial phagocytosis is a highly energy&#8208;consuming process that plays critical roles in clearing neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, microglial metabolism is defective overall in AD, thereby undermining microglial phagocytic functions. Herein, we repurpose the existing antineoplastic drug lonidamine (LND) conjugated with hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) as a &#8220;microglial energy modulator&#8221; (termed LND@HMPB&#8208;T7) for safe and synergistic A&#946; clearance. The modified blood&#8211;brain barrier penetrating heptapeptide (T7) enables efficient transport of LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 to the AD brain. LND in LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could fuel A&#946; phagocytosis by stimulating microglial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, whereas HMPB with catalase and superoxide dismutase&#8208;mimicking activities substantially alleviates the mitochondrial side effects commonly associated with LND and thus further enhances ATP production. The synergism of LND and nanozyme affords a high microglial A&#946; clearance efficacy without triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. In vivo experiments ascertain that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could synergistically promote phagocytic clearance of A&#946;, relieve neuroinflammation and ameliorate cognitive function in AD mice. These findings indicate that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 holds tremendous clinical potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment.

         <title>Program&#8208;Modulated Kinetics of Perovskite&#8208;Film Growth by Molecular &#8220;Thruster&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;, a hypervalent iodine (III) compound, was used to programmatically modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth. This molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221; features three carbonyl groups and C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond, which endows its strongly coordination and dissociation abilities, thus programmatically regulating perovskite film growth by retarding the reaction between FAI and PbI2, promoting solvent volatilization, and passivating the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film exhibits high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and significantly reduced defects. As a result, the pero&#8208;SCs simultaneously achieved outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent operational stability.







Abstract
The rapid reaction between lead iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) films. Conventional methods, such as using nonvolatile small molecular additives to slow the reaction, often result in buried interfacial voids and molecule diffusion, compromising the devices&#8217; operational stability. In this study, we introduced a molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;&#8212;a hypervalent iodine (III) compound with three carbonyl groups and a C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond&#8212;that possesses coordination and dissociation abilities, enabling programed modulation of perovskite&#8208;film growth kinetics. Initially, the three carbonyl groups coordinate with PbI2 to slow the reaction between FAI and PbI2, preventing &#948;&#8208;phase formation. As temperature rises, the C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond dissociates, promoting perovskite growth and the dissociated product iodobenzene will promote solvent volatilization, thus avoiding buried interfacial voids. Another product, a carbene compound with eight lone pair electrons sufficiently passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and anchors at grain boundaries without diffusion. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film displays high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and reduced defects. Evidently, 0.062&#8208; and 1.004&#8208;cm2 pero&#8208;SCs achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 26.06&#8201;% (25.79&#8201;% certified) and 24.65&#8201;%, respectively. This approach also controls perovskite&#8208;film growth on plastic substrates, resulting in flexible pero&#8208;SCs with an impressive PCE of 25.12&#8201;%.

         <title>sp Carbon Disrupting Axial Symmetry of Local Electric Field for Biomimetic Construction of Three&#8208;Dimensional Geometric and Electronic Structure in Nanozyme for Sensing and Microplastic Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the synergistic interaction between active centers and cofactors in natural enzymes, a three&#8208;dimensional graphene/copper nanoparticles/graphdiyne (G/Cu/GDY) nanozyme is developed. The incorporation of graphdiyne disrupts the axial symmetry of electron distribution on the surface of copper nanoparticles, resulting in an asymmetric electron configuration, which in turn generates a unique local electric field within the nanozyme. This electric field promotes rapid electron transfer, facilitating efficient interaction between substrate molecules and active sites, effectively replicating the characteristic electron transfer process of natural enzymes.







Abstract
The catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes depends on the precise electronic interactions between active centers and cofactors within a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) attempt to mimic this structure by modifying metal active sites with molecular ligands. However, SAzymes struggle to match the catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes due to constraints in active site proximity, quantity, and the inability to simulate electron transfer processes driven by internal electronic structures of natural enzymes. This study introduces a universal spatial engineering strategy in which molecular ligands are replaced with graphdiyne (GDY) to induce d&#8208;&#960; orbital hybridization with copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs), leading to an asymmetric electron&#8208;rich distribution along the longitudinal axis that mimics the local electric field of natural laccase. Moreover, multiple sp bonds within GDY scaffold effectively anchor Cu NPs, facilitating the construction of 3D geometric structure similar to that of natural laccase. An enzymatic activity of 82.53&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1 is achieved, 4.72&#8197;times higher than that of natural laccase. By reconstructing both 3D structures and local electric fields of natural enzymes through d&#8208;&#960; orbital hybridization, this approach enhances electron interactions between cofactors, active centers, and substrates, and offers a versatile framework for biomimetic design of nanozymes.

         <title>Charge Manipulation of Porous Coordination Cages Tunes the Efficiency and Selectivity in Electrochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge species of the porous coordination cages are regulated by ligand strategy. The charge&#8208;tunable porous coordination cages exhibit performance tweaking ability in the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, which can not only indirectly adjust the efficiency of nitrate electrosynthesis of ammonia, but also modulate the product selectivity of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals has been attracting growing interest owing to its environmentally benign reaction pathways. Among these processes, the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3), known as NO3RR, and the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) stand out as two cornerstone reactions; yet, their efficiency and selectivity pose ongoing challenges. In this study, we introduce a charge manipulation approach for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts tailored for the simultaneous coupling of NO3RR and HMFOR. We have synthesized a range of porous coordination cages (PCCs) that share the same topology and Co/Ni metal centers but incorporate different charged moieties, imparting them with distinct surface net charges. Electrocatalytic evaluations revealed that PCC&#8208;Co demonstrated a voltage&#8208;dependent activity in NO3RR. Conversely, PCC&#8208;Ni exhibited a precisely adjustable product selectivity in HMFOR, contingent upon the cage&#8216;s charge state. In situ analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations underscored the profound impact of catalyst charge on the differential adsorption of reaction intermediates and the lowest free energy change (&#916;G) during the pivotal reaction step, resulting in alterations to both activity and selectivity. These discoveries provide invaluable insights into the &#8220;structure&#8208;performance relationship&#8221; of NO3RR/HMFOR catalysts, highlighting PCCs as promising contenders for advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ion Hydration Enables Generality in Asymmetric Catalysis: Desymmetrization to P&#8208;Stereogenic Triarylphosphine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate generality has been achieved through exploiting the fundamental physicochemical phenomenon of ion hydration. This strategy enables catalytic desymmetrization to access scaffold&#8208;diversified P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides and sulfides (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). The in situ tuning of hydration shells by water and the correlation between water/ion ratio and the geometry of the substrates (i.e., dO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl) render this approach practical and predictable.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis relies on seamless transmission of stereochemical information from a chiral reagent/catalyst to a prochiral substrate. The disruption by substrates&#8217; structural changes presents a hurdle in innovating generality&#8208;oriented asymmetric catalysis. Here, we report a strategy for substrate adaptability by exploiting a fundamental physicochemical phenomenon&#8212;ion hydration, in developing remote desymmetrization to access P&#8208;stereogenic triarylphosphine oxides and sulfides. Compared to existing methods, this approach does not require pre&#8208;installed ortho substituents and avoids the use of Grignard/organolithium reagents. Simply tuning the water/ion ratio in the reaction media tailors the water&#8208;mediated ionic substrate&#8211;catalyst preorganization to counterbalance the structural changes in the substrates, thus further increasing the diversity of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic compounds. This study shows that it is viable and practical to precisely manipulate ionic interactions through tuning the dynamic ion hydration in situ, thereby adding a distinctive dimension to catalyst engineering in the pursuit of substrate generality in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Distonic Radical Cation Reactivity in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox activation of D&#8722;A cyclopropanes is unlocked, leading to distonic radical cations for a traditionally polarity&#8208;mismatched [3+2] cycloaddition with unactivated olefins. Further extension leads to facile access of cyclopentenes as well as bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by [&#963;+&#960;] and [&#963;+&#963;] cycloaddition respectively.







Abstract
Altering the reactivity model of a molecule can potentially eliminate limitations existing in its current paradigm. When it comes to the activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes (DACs), Lewis acids have been the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Although a variety of polarized 2&#960; components have been successfully coupled with DACs for [3+2] cycloaddition, unpolarized alkenes prove to be a roadblock due to an inherent polarity mismatch with the Lewis acid&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediate. Hereby, harnessing the distonic radical cation mode of cleavage by photoredox catalysis overcomes this mismatched reactivity of the zwitterionic intermediate, providing a unique route to highly substituted cyclopentanes and cyclopentenes. Expansion of this strategy to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes enables access to bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHs) through a facile [3&#963;+2&#963;] cycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic insights are also provided using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking of FeN4 Moiety via Edge Defects for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, with a planar D4h symmetric FeN4 structure, show promising as noble metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction catalysts. Nonetheless, the highly symmetric structure restricts the effective manipulation of its geometric and electronic structures, impeding further enhancements in oxygen reduction reaction performance. Here, a high proportion of asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon was successfully introduced into Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts through morphology engineering, enabling the precise modulation of the FeN4 active site. Electrochemical experimental results demonstrate that FeN4@porous carbon (FeN4@PC), featuring enriched asymmetric edge&#8208;FeN4 active sites, exhibits higher acidic oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity compared to FeN4@flaky carbon (FeN4@FC), where symmetric FeN4 is primarily distributed within the basal&#8208;plane. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectra, X&#8208;ray emission spectra, and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity of FeN4@PC is attributed to the higher oxidation state of Fe species in the edge structure of FeN4@PC. This finding paves the way for controlling the local geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom active sites, leading to the development of novel and efficient Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerization&#8208;Controlled Aggregation in Photoactive Layer: An Additive Strategy for Organic Solar Cells with Over 19.5&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric molecules are employed as additives in organic photovoltaics. Stepwise regulations of acceptor aggregation are realized. Liquid additive LCB retards solvent evaporation, preventing excessive aggregation. Solid additive SCB shortens aggregation period, obtaining tight molecular stacking. While volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes intermolecular interactions, achieving optimal molecular aggregation, which lead to significant efficiency enhancement of PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices up to 19.51%







Abstract
Morphology control of the photoactive layer is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), yet it remains a significant challenge in this field. One effective approach is the additive strategy, which fine&#8208;tunes the morphology of the photoactive layer. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the impact of different types of additives from liquid, solid, to volatile solid, on the bulk heterojunction morphology and device performance are not fully understood. Herein, we present an aggregation regulation strategy for acceptor molecules by incorporating three novel isomeric additives: 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (LCB), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (SCB), and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (VCB) into the blend active layer. This approach optimizes the bulk heterojunction morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Our results reveal that these additives induce stepwise regulation of acceptor molecule aggregation during film formation. The liquid additive LCB primarily extends solvent evaporation time, effectively preventing excessive aggregation, while the solid additive SCB significantly shortens the aggregation period during the film evolution, resulting in the most compact molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Furthermore, the volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes the intermolecular interactions and crystallization within the active layer, promoting optimal molecular self&#8208;assembly and aggregation for ideal molecular stacking. Consequently, the power conversion efficiencies of 19.33&#8201;% and 19.51&#8201;% were achieved for the VCB&#8208;processed D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208; and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs, respectively, outperforming the LCB&#8208;processed and SCB&#8208;processed devices.

         <title>Microbe Engineering to Provide Drimane&#8208;Type Building Blocks for Chiral Pool Synthesis of Meroterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational engineering of PhoN and the incorporation of a Nudix hydrolase, an optimized PhoN&#8208;IPK system was developed, enabling the efficient production of drimane&#8208;type building blocks of drimenol (398&#8197;mg/L) and albicanol (3.5&#8197;g/L). Albicanol, serving as a versatile chiral pool precursor, facilitated the direct and concise synthesis of a variety of drimane&#8208;type merosesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type merosesquiterpenoids (DMT) are a class of natural products with diverse structures and broad biological activity. Classical DMT synthesis relies on atom&#8208;inefficient plant&#8208;derived chiral pool building blocks, while alternative drimane&#8208;type building blocks such as drimenol and albicanol offer more direct routes but face production challenges. In this study, we engineered a microbial platform for efficient production of these building blocks. By optimizing the PhoN&#8208;IPK system through rational engineering and incorporating a Nudix hydrolase, we achieved a drimenol production of 398&#8197;mg/L and high albicanol titers of 1805&#8197;mg/L in shake flasks and 3.5&#8197;g/L in a bioreactor. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of the engineered PhoN provided insights into its improved catalytic efficiency. We demonstrated the utility of this platform by synthesizing several DMT using albicanol as the starting material, reducing the number of synthetic steps and improving overall efficiency as compared to classical approaches.

We demonstrated the utility of this platform by synthesizing several DMT using albicanol as the starting material, reducing the number of synthetic steps and improving overall efficiency as compared to classical approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimized Adsorption of Had and OHad over Amorphous SrRuPtOxHy Nanobelts towards Efficient Alkaline Fuel Cell Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a new class of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs) with excellent performance towards alkaline HOR and AEMFCs. Electrochemical experiments and calculations collectively show that a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs have optimized HBE and OHBE as well as low HOR barrier, which all greatly improve the HOR efficiency.







Abstract
PtRu&#8208;based catalysts toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffer from low efficiency, CO poisoning and over&#8208;oxidation at high potentials. In this work, an amorphization strategy is adopted for preparation of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs). The a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs has optimized adsorption of intermediates (H and OH), increased number of active sites, highly weakened CO poisoning and enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation ability owing to the special amorphous structure. Consequently, a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs displays superior HOR performance with a mass activity of 7.5&#8197;A/mgPt+Ru, 25 and 5&#8197;times of that of SrRuPt(OH)x NBs and commercial PtRu/C, respectively, and long&#8208;lasting stability. Besides, a peak power density of 750&#8197;mW/cm2 and a specific power of 14.8&#8197;W/mgPt+Ru have been achieved for a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs at a low loading of 0.05&#8197;mgPt+Ru/cm2, surpassing many reported HOR catalysts. Mechanism investigation indicates that Pt and Ru are present in oxide/hydroxide forms and H in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs participates in HOR. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that there are three catalytic mechanisms participating in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs, which all exhibit low catalytic barrier and highly improved HOR efficiency. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards fuel cells.

         <title>Controlled Lipid Domain Positioning and Polarization in Confined Minimal Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic confinement of phase&#8208;separating giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) directs the accumulation of the minority&#8208;phase domains in the free regions where they fuse to minimize their line energy. This results in the localization of lipid domains at prescribed positions and the possibility to build polarized cell models with a control over the number and position of the poles.







Abstract
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are widely used minimal cell models where essential biological features can be reproduced, isolated and studied. Although precise spatio&#8208;temporal distribution of membrane domains is a process of crucial importance in living cells, it is still highly challenging to generate anisotropic GUVs with domains at user&#8208;defined positions. Here we describe a novel and robust method to control the spatial position of lipid domains of liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo)/liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phase in giant unilamellar vesicles. Our strategy consists in confining Lo/Ld phase&#8208;separating GUVs in microfluidic channels to define free curved regions where the minority&#8208;phase domains localize and coalesce by decreasing the line energy through domain fusion. We show that this process is governed by the respective fraction of the two phases, and not by the chemical nature of the lipids involved. The spatial position and number of domains are controlled by the design of the confining microchannel and could result in polarized GUVs with a controllable number of poles. The developed method is versatile and user&#8208;friendly, while allowing multiple single&#8208;vesicle experiments in parallel.

         <title>Adjacent&#8208;Ligand Tuning of Atomically Precise Cu&#8722;Pd Sites Enables Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation with a CO&#8208;Free Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing axial organic ligands to modify the atomically dispersed copper single atoms on the surface of Pd&#8208;metallene, we have constructed a catalyst with adjacent&#8208;ligand regulation effect to significantly enhance the catalytic performance of MOR.







Abstract
Whether the catalyst can realize the non&#8208;CO pathway is the key to greatly improve the catalytic activity and stability of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). It is feasible to optimize the reaction path selectivity by modifying organic ligands and constructing single&#8208;atom systems. At the same time, heterogeneous metal nanosheets with atomic thickness have been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of materials due to their ultra&#8208;high exposure of active sites and synergistic effects. Herein, we synthesize an ultra&#8208;thin heterogeneous alloy metallene with organic ligand&#8208;modified surface Cu single atom by one&#8208;pot wet chemical method, and further construct an efficient Cu&#8722;Pd active sites. The prepared octanoic acid ligand modified PdCu single&#8208;atom alloys metallene (SAA OA&#8722;Cu&#8208;Pdene) shows excellent catalytic activity and stability, with mass activity up to 5.64&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) up to 160.39&#8197;m2&#8201;gPd&#8722;1. Structural characterization and in situ experiment jointly indicate that ligand modulation brings about charge transfer, and the accompanying rapid migration of OH&#8722; greatly improves the selectivity of non&#8208;CO pathways while improving the catalytic activity. The results highlight the importance of adjacent&#8208;ligand regulation and provide a new strategy for the design of MOR catalysts with high selectivity of non&#8208;CO pathway.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis Enables Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclopropene and Ring Expansion of Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding interaction enables catalyzing the ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In contrast, transition metal and thermal approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. This research reveals that chalcogen bonding catalysts can play a role in producing and regulating carbene species, thus providing an alternative platform for solving reactivity problem in carbene transformations.







Abstract
Catalytic transformation of carbene species constitutes a fundamental part in organic synthesis, and the research in this direction has been dominated by transition metals while organic catalysts are difficult to mimic such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity. It would significantly advance carbene chemistry if organic catalysts enable achieving classical metal&#8208;carbene approaches otherwise unrealizable reactions. Herein, we report that chalcogen bonding catalysis can solve reactivity problem to achieve an elusive Buchner ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In this work, the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and the ring&#8208;expansion of aryl systems were added in the field of noncovalent catalysis. This work demonstrates that chalcogen bonding can mediate carbene transformations beyond the known ionic approach. In contrast, transition metals such as rhodium, palladium, and copper complexes, could not solve the reactivity problem to achieve ring expansion of aryl ketones but instead these metal&#8208;carbene approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. In addition, a thermal approach even being conducted at 200&#8201;&#176;C could not achieve this ring expansion reaction. Mechanistic investigation suggests Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction with cyclopropene facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and chalcogen bonding with carbene intermediate changes the reaction pathway, thus overriding the furan reaction pathway.

Combining lignin with Upy, results in a red RTP material (Lig&#8208;Upy) with emission centered at 625&#8197;nm and a lifetime of 24.2&#8197;ms. Materials exhibiting time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent colors could be prepared using the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions within Lig&#8208;Upy when embedded into different polymer matrices.







Abstract
Materials with red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) derived from sustainable resources are crucial but rarely reported. Here, we produced red RTP materials from lignin. Lignin was covalently modified with Upy (1&#8208;(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) urea) to obtain Lig&#8208;Upy. The Upy in the Lig&#8208;Upy promoted the interaction between the aromatic units of lignin and reduced energy gaps of these molecules. As a result, Lig&#8208;Upy exhibited red RTP centered at 625&#8197;nm with a lifetime of 24.2&#8197;ms. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interactions in Lig&#8208;Upy varied when embedded into different matrices, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or sodium montmorillonite (MTM), inducing a change in RTP wavelength and lifetime. Utilizing these properties, Lig&#8208;Upy was used as building blocks for producing materials exhibiting time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent colors (TDPCs). Such TDPCs materials have exhibited great potential for visual decorations, information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting logos for medicine bottles.

         <title>Arraying and Guest Inclusion of Soluble Metal&#8208;Organic Nanotubes Composed of Macrocyclic Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular and square metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were constructed based on paddlewheel Rh dimer complexes. The side chains introduced into the metal complexes allowed the nanotubes to dissolve in solutions. The nanotubes were cast on a substrate to form a solid film oriented over a wide area. In addition, the nanotubes encapsulated guest molecules.







Abstract
A new series of metal&#8208;organic nanotubes was constructed through one&#8208;dimensional assembly using molecular triangles or molecular squares composed of paddlewheel dirhodium complexes and bidentate axial ligands. The metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were significantly different from conventional solid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) motifs. They exhibit good solubility owing to the branched side chains at their periphery and demonstrate high orientation capabilities in thin films owing to their anisotropic structure. Furthermore, the nanotubes can accommodate guest molecules in nanochannels and orient them on a large scale on a glass substrate.

         <title>Rapid N2O Formation from N2 on Water Droplet Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen (N2) is regarded as a stable reservoir for the N element in the atmosphere. However, this study finds that the stable N2 can rapidly react with atmospheric oxygen and ozone on ubiquitous water droplet surfaces via a novel reduction&#8208;then&#8208;oxidation pathway, resulting in the formation of nitrous oxide &#8211; the third most impactful greenhouse gas.







Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) has long been considered as stable atmospheric reservoir for N element and has a persistence time of hundreds of years. This study reveals that oxygen (O2) at typical tropospheric concentrations can rapidly activate N2, leading to substantial production of nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most impactful greenhouse gas, at rates approaching 2.83&#177;0.41 ppmv hour&#8722;1 catalyzed by ubiquitous water droplets in experimental systems. Notably, ozone (O3), typically consumed by N2O in the stratosphere, can further accelerate N2O formation. In contrast, the produced N2O concentration is below detection limits in the absence of O2/O3 or water droplets. A novel reduction&#8208;then&#8208;oxidation (RTO) mechanism was proposed to account for the rapid formation of N2O on the water droplet surfaces facilitated by the cooperation of water droplets and O2/O3. Further extrapolation indicates that the RTO pathway contributes several Tg N N2O annually, far exceeding the most known sources of N2O. These findings have broad implications for tracing atmospheric N2O sources, enhancing understanding of climate&#8208;O2/O3 interactions, and paving avenues for developing new methodologies for N2O synthesis.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired MXene&#8208;Integrated Mechanochromic Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Visible&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Radar Multispectral Camouflage</title>

         <dc:description>
Cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability exhibit dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching. Advanced pneumatically driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models demonstrate visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states.







Abstract
Multispectral camouflage materials that provide adaptable features across a wide spectrum, from visible light to radar frequencies, play a vital role in sophisticated multi&#8208;band electromagnetic (EM) applications. However, conventional single&#8208;band stealth is difficult to align with the growing demand for multi&#8208;band compatibility and intelligent adaptation. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability, which was fabricated through in situ thiol&#8208;acrylate Michael addition and free&#8208;radical photopolymerization of CLCE precursor and isocyanate&#8208;mediated robust covalent chemical bonding of MXene nanocoating at the interface. The resulting MXene&#8208;CLCE exhibits dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching, with its infrared stealth and microwave shielding properties being realized through the reconfiguration of surface morphology from planar to cracked states via mechanical actuation. A visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared camouflage octopus&#8208;patterned MXene&#8208;CLCE is demonstrated to achieve a stealth effect across the visible&#8208;infrared spectrum upon mechanical stretching. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pneumatic&#8208;driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models are demonstrated, which enables dynamic visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states. The research herein can offer new perspectives on the development of bioinspired smart camouflage materials and their application in various emerging fields such as smart optical stealth, dynamic thermal management, and switchable electromagnetic devices.

         <dc:description>
Behind bioorthogonal chemistry: micelles constructed with amphiphiles bearing bioorthogonal reactants allowed non&#8208;bioorthogonal chemistry in a confined environment. Application of this strategy was made with the synthesis of an FDA&#8208;approved anticancer drug inside living cells. Apart from this application, this strategy could represent a change of paradigm, allowing an extension of the concept of bioorthogonal chemistry.







Abstract
The development of innovative strategies enabling chemical reactions in living systems is of great interest for exploring and manipulating biological processes. Herein, we present a pioneering approach based on both bioorthogonal and confined chemistry for intracellular drug synthesis. Exploiting a click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction, we engineered nanoparticles capable of synthesizing drugs within cellular environments through bioorthogonal reactions with cyclooctynes. Proof of concept experiments showed that this new approach could be successfully applied to the synthesis of the FDA&#8208;approved Sorafenib within cancer cells. The integration of bioorthogonal and confined chemistry not only offers exciting prospects for advancing therapeutic strategies but also opens up new avenues for exploring non&#8208;natural reactions within living systems. This innovative approach represents a fundamental extension of the biorthogonal chemistry concept and holds great promise for pioneering developments in therapeutic applications.

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene produced either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile with high regioselectivity. The success of this process is attributed to the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which create a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center.







Abstract
In industry, the two important nitrile starting materials, adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile, are primarily manufactured through the well&#8208;known DuPont process, which consists of a tandem sequence including first hydrocyanation, isomerization and second hydrocyanation. However, this mature process has the intrinsic defects of step efficiency and regioselectivity. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to produce either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile in high regioselectivity. The key to this success lies in the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which creates a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center. The first hydrocyanation that produces either the linear or branched alkenyl nitrile was identified as the selectivity&#8208;determining step. Organometallic studies confirm the formation of well&#8208;defined diphosphite nickel diene complexes in solution, and the role of ligands in dictating regioselectivity was further rationalized by DFT computations. This result provides the first example of a highly selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile from butadiene, and it also represents a high&#8208;level of catalyst&#8208;controlled regioselectivity via the fine&#8208;tuning of ligand pocket geometry.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Tiered Golf Anode towards Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;Mn Aqueous Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive and three&#8208;tiered golf anode was developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The experiment characterizations and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs) are widely recognized as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of ZMABs is hindered by inherent electrical contact loss, hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth on traditional anodes. Here, a three&#8208;tiered golf anode with high conductivity is developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode, thus enabling stable Zn&#8722;Mn cycling. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8722;Mn full cells (coupled to CNT@MnO2) achieve an ultralong cycle life with 94.6&#8201;% capacity retention at 2&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 16,000&#8197;cycles. This study presents valuable insights into the structural design of anodes aimed at enhancing the stability and durability of ZMABs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesis of Orange Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the successful synthesis of a polar phosphorus allotrope, termed &#8220;orange phosphorus,&#8221; using a photo&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up technique. The structure, consisting of unidirectionally aligned tubular pentagons of [P8]P2[, was confirmed through 3D electron diffraction analysis. The outstanding piezoresistivity of [P8]P2[ highlights its potential applications.







Abstract
A tubular strand of phosphorus composed of vectorially aligned pentagons has been theoretically predicted as a new allotrope of phosphorus with a polar structure, expecting potential applications. However, it has not been successfully synthesized yet due to the difficulty of creating isolated strands to avoid interchain bonding. Here, such an allotrope named &#8220;orange phosphorus&#8220; was successfully produced using a photo&#8208;assisted synthesis from an amorphous film of solution&#8208;processable Na2P16 precursors. A green laser irradiation initiated the phase transition of precursors, inducing chemical reactions like topochemical polymerization and rearrangement, creating a 1D chain of orange phosphorus. 3D electron diffraction crystallography showed that the molecular structure of orange phosphorus consists of one&#8208;dimensional polar pentagonal&#8208;tubes made up of [P8]P2[ repeat units. Orange phosphorus demonstrates excellent piezoresistivity due to its high strain&#8208;sensitive 1D chain structure, showing strain&#8208;induced Raman shifts. Its gauge factor exceeds those of 2D materials such as black phosphorus and transition metal dichalcogenides. These findings indicate that orange phosphorus has great potential for use in strain sensor applications.

         <title>Active Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Preferential Cleavage of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bonds in Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) to produce high&#8208;value formic acid (FA) is hindered by high formation potential of active species and sluggish C&#8208;C bond cleavage kinetics. Herein, Ni single&#8208;atom (NiSA) and Co single&#8208;atom (CoSA) dual sites anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Ni0.1Co0.9 alloy (Ni0.1Co0.9@NiSACoSA&#8208;NCNTs) are constructed for electrochemical GOR. Remarkably, it can reach 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at a low potential of 1.15 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and realize a high formate selectivity of 91.3% even at high glycerol conversion of 99.8% at 1.45 V vs. RHE. The GOR mechanism and pathway are systematically elucidated via experimental analyses and theoretical calculations. It is revealed that the active hydroxyl (*OH) can be produced during the GOR. The NiSA, CoSA, and Ni0.1Co0.9 synergistically optimizes the electronic structure of CoSA active sites, reducing the energy barriers of *OH&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds and dehydrogenation of C1 intermediates. This decreases the number of reaction intermediates and reaction steps of GOR&#8208;to&#8208;FA, thus increasing the formate production efficiency. After coupling GOR with hydrogen evolution reaction in a membrane electrode assembly cell, 14.26 g of formate and 23.10 L of H2 are produced at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for 108 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Intrinsic Free Charge Generation: Promoting the Construction of over 19% Efficient Planar p&#8208;n Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to high binding energy and extremely short diffusion distance of Frenkel excitons in common organic semiconductors at early stage, mechanism of interface charge transfer&#8208;mediated free carrier generation has dominated the development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, considering the advancements in materials and device performance, it is necessary to reexamine the photoelectric conversion in current&#8208;stage efficient OSCs. Here, we propose that the conjugated materials with specific three&#8208;dimensional donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated packing potentially exhibit distinctive charge photogeneration mechanism, which spontaneously split Wannier&#8208;Mott excitons to free carriers in pure phases. Subsequently, the pure planar p&#8208;n heterojunction (PHJ) OSCs based on green orthogonal solvents were prepared and exhibited comparable performance to that of BHJ OSCs. More interestingly, by introducing PVDF&#8208;TrFE as intrinsic region to regulate built&#8208;in electric field of the device, the planar p&#8208;i&#8208;n PHJ OSCs achieved much higher efficiency (&gt;18%) and stability. Moreover, a prominent efficiency of over 19% has been obtained via ternary optimization, which is the new efficiency record for PHJ OSCs up to date. This study points towards the distinguishing intrinsic free charge generation mechanism, opens up a new avenue for OSCs to collectively realize high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;term duration, and simplified device engineering for future commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrastable Imidazole&#8208;linked Porous Organic Cages for Ammonia Capture and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in&#8208;situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern&#8208;like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl&#8208;functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o&#8208;phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162 m2 g&#8208;1. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole-linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in-situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern-like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl-functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o-phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162 m2 g-1. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, IPOC-2 and IPOC-4 display a remarkable NH3 capturing capability, with uptakes of up to 11.5 mmol g-1 at 1 bar and 298 K, surpassing most reported porous organic materials. Additionally, IPOC-1 exhibits highly efficient fluorescent quenching sensing of aqueous NH3, with a detection limit as low as 3.35 &#215; 10-6 M. These findings strongly suggest the potential for widespread use of imidazole linkages in the development of robust functional porous organic cage materials for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel Nanocluster&#8208;Stabilized Unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 Atomic Sites for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Electrolysis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsaturated Ni single atom catalysts (SACs), Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3), have been investigated to break the conventional Ni&#8208;N4 structural limitation and provide more unoccupied 3d orbitals for CO2RR intermediates adsorption, but their intrinsically low structural stability has seriously hindered their applications. Here, we developed a strategy by integrating Ni nanoclusters to stabilize unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO at industrial&#8208;level current. DFT&#160;calculations revealed that the incorporation of Ni nanocluster effectively stabilizes the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites and modulates their electronic structure to enhance the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH during CO2RR. Guided by these insights, we prepared an optimal composite catalyst, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3, which features a Ni6N6 nanocluster surrounded by six Ni&#8208;N3 single atoms sites, through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. As a result, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 demonstrated a remarkably high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.7% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 83984.2 h&#8208;1 at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 under &#8208;1.15 VRHE, much better than the conventional&#160;Ni&#8208;N4 . XAS analyses of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 before and after long&#8208;term CO2RR testing confirmed the excellent stability of its coordinative environment. This work highlights a generalizable approach for stabilizing unsaturated single&#8208;atom catalysts, paving the way for their application in high&#8208;performance CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N2 reduction reaction (NRR) by light is an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis technology. However, it faces significant challenges, including high energy barriers of N2 activation and unclear catalytic active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy of photo&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device. We used redox&#8208;catalysis covalent organic framework (COF), with a redox site (&#8208;C=O) for H+ reversible storage and a catalytic site (porphyrin Au) for NRR. In the proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device, the COF can successfully store e&#8208; and H+ generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction, forming COF&#8208;H. Then, these stored e&#8208; and H+ can be used for photo&#8208;driven NRR (108.97 umol g&#8208;1) under low proton concentration promoted by the H&#8208;bond network formed between &#8208;OH in COF&#8208;H and N2 on Au, which enabled N2 hydrogenation and NH3 production, establishing basis for advancing artificial photosynthesis and enhancing ammonia synthesis technology.</dc:description>

In the proton-mediated photoelectrochemical device, the COF can successfully store e- and H+ generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction, forming COF-H.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Cubic Quantum Dots along Supramolecular Templates of Naphthalenediimide Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of assembled structures of quantum dots (QDs) is crucial for realizing the desired photophysical properties, but this remains challenging. Especially, the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) control is rare due to the nearly isotropic nature of QDs. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for controlling the 1D&#8208;arrangement range of cubic perovskite QDs in solution based on the morphological modification of a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The original template with a short and tangled fibrous structure is prepared in a low&#8208;polarity solvent mixture via self&#8208;assembly of a naphthalenediimide&#8208;functionalized cholesterol derivative with an adhesion group for QDs. Mixing this template with QDs leads to the co&#8208;aggregation into short&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs on the templates. Notably, subsequent heating and cooling of the co&#8208;aggregate solution forms longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs with lateral growth, where arranged QDs are sandwiched between reconstructed SP templates. Furthermore, the longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;array of QDs is achieved via an alternative route involving the pre&#8208;organization of templates into longer and dispersed fibers by heating and cooling of the original template, succeeded by co&#8208;assembly with QDs. Finally, we reveal continuous fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photoluminescence decay curves.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroarchitectural Gas Diffusion Layer Promotes CO2 Reduction Coupled with Biomass Oxidation at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high product selectivity at ampere&#8208;level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7% was achieved at a current density of 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 in 6 M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40 hours at 400 mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2&#8208;supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C&#8208;C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2% for ethylene and 85.4% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2. This work&#160;provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere&#8208;level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack&#8208;level devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Packing Engineering of Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Cages in Mixed Matrix Membranes for CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been considered as emerging zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) porous fillers to generate molecularly homogenous MOC&#8208;based membrane materials. However, the discontinuous pore connectivity and low filler concentrations limit the improvement of membrane separation performance. Herein, we propose the dimension augmentation of MOCs in membranes using three&#8208;dimensional (3D) supramolecular MOC networks as filler materials in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). We further explore the packing engineering of MOC networks to produce distinct polymorphs (&#945; and &#946; phases) for tailoring membrane performance. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy were employed to differentiate distinct MOC polymorphous networks within membranes. Gas permeation tests revealed that the corresponding MMMs showed superior CO2/CH4 separation performance, exceeding the Robeson upper bound. Our proposed approach is expected to enrich the repertoire of reticular chemistry pertaining to molecular&#8208;based networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu Sites for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol with 99.5% Selectivity in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to ethanol is extremely challenging due to the limited efficiency of charge separation, sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling, and unfavorable formation of oxygenate intermediates. Here, we elaborately design a red polymer carbon nitride (RPCN) consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites (Cu/S&#8208;RPCN) to address this challenge, which achieves an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with 99.5% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water. Cu and S atoms within the Cu&#8722;N&#8722;S configuration can serve as trapping centers for electrons and holes, respectively, providing spatial separation for photogenerated charge carriers. The incorporation of S atoms optimizes the adsorption of *CO on Cu atoms and reduces the energy barrier for the formation of *CO&#8722;COH intermediate. The adsorption strength of *OCHCH2OH intermediate on the Cu atoms via the O&#8722;Cu&#8722;C configuration can affect the selectivity of the C2 products as the cleavage of the Cu&#8722;O/Cu&#8722;C bonds determines the ethanol/ethylene pathway. The S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu structure weakens the Cu&#8722;O bond, thereby promoting the production of ethanol. This work provides a novel approach to fine&#8208;tune the surrounding microenvironment of metal atoms on carbon nitride for highly effective photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to ethanol.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven CO2 reduction to ethanol is extremely challenging due to the limited efficiency of charge separation, sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling, and unfavorable formation of oxygenate intermediates.

         <title>Li+ Quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Topochemistry Transport Enables Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries offers economic benefits and a reduced CO2 footprint. Surface prelithiation, particularly through the molten salt method, is critical in enhancing spent cathode repair during high&#8208;temperature annealing. However, the sluggish Li+ transport kinetics, which relies on thermally driven processes in the traditional molten salt methods, limit the prelithiation efficiency and regeneration of spent cathodes. Here, we introduce a special molecular configuration (benzoate) into molten salts that facilitates rapid Li+ transport to the surface of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism, effectively avoiding the phase transitions that could adversely degrade the electrochemical performance due to insufficient lithiation during the repair process. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the system enables fast Li+ migration through the topological hopping of benzoate in organic lithium salt, rather than relying solely on thermally driven diffusion, thereby significantly improving the prelithiation and repair efficiency of spent NCM cathodes. Benefiting from the quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Li+ topochemistry transport, the degraded structure and Li vacancies in the spent cathode are effectively eliminated, and the regenerated cathode exhibits good cycling stability comparable to commercial counterparts. The proposed Li+ transport mechanism presents a promising route for the efficient regeneration of spent cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyglycidamides: from Backbone&#8208;Promoted Amidation to Degradable Polyether with Wide&#8208;Range LCST</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide groups occur extensively in natural and synthetic polymers cultivating their vital roles in biological and industrial worlds. We report here an efficient and controlled pathway to amide&#8208;functionalized polyethers through ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of commercially available ethyl glycidate followed by amidation of the pendant ester groups. Transesterification is inhibited during the ROP by use of a two&#8208;component organocatalyst. Surprisingly, amidation can be completed even at 0 &#176;C uncatalyzed, which is attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the oxygenated backbone as well as the inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding. Also interestingly, ethylene glycol and water are found to further accelerate the amidation while suppressing backbone degradation. The obtained&#160;polyglycidamides (PGAms) exhibit aqueous thermoresponsive properties, similar to their carbon&#8208;chain counterparts (polyacrylamides). Cloud point can be linearly modulated by co&#8208;amidation using two amines of varied ratios. Unlike polyacrylamides and regular polyethers, PGAm is degradable through retro&#8208;oxa&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyrosinase&#8208;Catalyzed Peptide Stapling Using para&#8208;Amino Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Anchoring Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide stapling techniques have historically relied on metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reactions, with no examples using enzymes. Here, inspired by tyrosinase&#8208;mediated oxidation, we describe the efficient side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain coupling of p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids using a commercially available tyrosinase. Stapling reactions between the i, i+3 to i, i+7 positions were all performed, proceeding in good conversion and under mild conditions compatible with various side chains, functional motifs and ring sizes, with the Z&#8208;Y product found to be more stable and obtained in a higher yield than the Y&#8208;Z product. Z&#8208;Y stapled versions of ER, MC4 and GPR54 binding peptides exhibited higher serum stability, helical content and binding affinity than their linear counterparts, proving the utility of our method to synthesize biologically significant peptides. The tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;Y peptide stapling technique expands the scope of available stapling techniques, and is proposed to develop stapled peptide drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Durable Rh Single Atom Catalyst Modulated by Surface Defects on Fe&#8208;Ce Oxide Solid Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Forming defect sites on catalyst supports and immobilizing precious metal atoms at these sites offers an efficient approach for preparing single&#8208;atom catalysts. In this study, we employed an Fe&#8208;Ce oxide solid solution (FC), which has surface oxygen that reduces more readily than that of ceria, to anchor Rh single atoms (Rh1). When utilized in the selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO (CO&#8208;SCR), Rh1/FC reduced at 500 &#176;C&#8212; characterized by less oxidic Rh state induced by an oxygen&#8208;deficient coordination&#8212;exhibited superior activity and durability compared to Rh1/ceria and Rh1/FC reduced at 300 &#176;C. This Rh single&#8208;atom structure was sustained after 100 hours of CO&#8208;SCR at 400 &#176;C. Reaction intermediates formed on the catalyst surface were analyzed using in&#8208;situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) under NO and CO flow conditions. Additionally, the catalyst structure and the CO&#8208;SCR reaction mechanism were investigated using density functional theory (DFT). While Rh atoms located near surface Fe sites were found to be thermodynamically most stable, both NO and CO preferentially adsorbed on Rh sites. Fe plays a role in stabilizing Rh sites and facilitating oxygen transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of highly active and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Intensifying Interfacial Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational regulation of active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial for advancing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3), yet in&#8208;depth understanding of the *H generation, transfer, and utilization remains ambiguous, and explorations for *H dynamic optimization are urgently needed. Herein we engineer a Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters (NF/Ni3N&#8208;Cu) for remarkably boosted NO3RR. From comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the Ni3N moieties favors water dissociation to generate *H, and then *H can rapidly transfer to the Cu via unique reverse hydrogen spillover mediating interfacial Ni&#8208;N&#8208;Cu bridge bond, thus increasing *H coverage on the Cu site for subsequent deoxygenation/hydrogenation. More impressively, such intriguing reverse hydrogen spillover effect can be further strengthened via elegant engineering of the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface with more intimate contact. Consequently, the NF/Ni3N&#8208;Cu with Cu nanoclusters intimate anchoring presents record NH3 yield rate of 1.19 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 98.7% at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE, being on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ones. Additionally, with NF/Ni3N&#8208;Cu as the cathode, a high&#8208;performing Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery can be assembled. This contribution illuminates a novel pathway to optimize *H behavior via distinct reverse hydrogen spillover for promoted NO3RR and other hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM = PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010 &#181;mol g&#8208;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02 &#181;mol g&#8208;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt; x &#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the ternary composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60 h without noticeable activity loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote carbon monoxide spillover improves tandem urea electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) offers a promising alternative to traditional industrial methods. However, current catalysts face limitations in the supplies of CO* and Nrelated* intermediates, and their coupling, resulting in unsatisfactory urea production efficiency and energy consumption. To overcome these challenges, we carried out tandem electrosynthesis approach using ruthenium dioxide&#8208;supported palladium&#8208;gold alloys (Pd2Au1/RuO2). This catalyst system effectively catalyzes CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO* conversion on Pd2Au1 and NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2* conversion on RuO2. Crucially, the minimized work function difference between two components promotes remote CO* spillover from Pd2Au1 to RuO2, improving effective coupling of CO* and NH2* for urea production. Our catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a record&#8208;high Faradaic efficiency for urea (FEurea) of 75.6&#177;0.5% and a urea production rate (rurea) of 73.5&#177;0.8 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Notably, this was accomplished with an ultralow energy consumption of 18.9 kWh kgurea&#8722;1. We also successfully demonstrate the long&#8208;term stability of our catalyst in a flow cell, achieving over 160 h of uninterrupted urea and formate production with consistent profitability. This achievement represents a significant step towards the large&#8208;scale practical application of sustainable urea electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Structure Elucidation of the Heterocumulene Anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8208; (L = CO, CS, N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8208; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8208;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8208; anion was sufficiently stable at 0 &#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8208; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8208;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8208; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking CO2 Activation with A Novel Ni&#8208;Hg&#8208;Ni&#160;Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni&#8211;Hg&#8211;Ni core (POCOP = &#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P&#180;&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate&#8208;bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its &#956;&#8722;CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32&#8208; and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter&#8217;s decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a &#956;&#8722;carbonyl&#8208;carbonate rather than a &#956;&#8722;oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Diacylation of Peptides Enables the Construction of Functional Vesicles for Drug&#8208;Carrying Liposomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are generated in cells by enzymatic diacylation of non&#8208;amphiphilic polar head groups. Analogous non&#8208;enzymatic processes may have been relevant at the origin of life and could have practical utility in membrane synthesis. However, aqueous head group diacylation is challenging in the absence of enzymes. The use of charged peptides instead of canonical phospholipid head groups offers advantages with respect to ease of acylation and chemical diversity. Here we demonstrate that native chemical ligation (NCL) enables in situ synthesis of diacylated lipopeptides (D&#8208;ALPs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into micron&#8208;sized vesicles resembling cellular membranes. Diacylation occurs between non&#8208;amphiphilic peptides possessing an N&#8208;terminal cysteine, and acyl thioesters. Peptide head groups endow unique membrane functions, which is demonstrated by incorporation of an arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (RGD) motif, resulting in vesicle targeting to &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. The biocompatibility and functional group programmability of D&#8208;ALPs supports their broad utility as membrane mimetics.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Reduction at a Borane&#8208;Modified Iron Complex: A Secondary Coordination Sphere Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5&#8208;) &#8211; a well&#8208;studied family of organometallic complex &#8211; as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*&#8208;BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for CO2&#160;to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]). Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2&#160;emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable &#8211; with such borane&#8208;containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal&#8208;ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Azetidines through Magnesium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Group&#160;Transfer from Iminoiodinane to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group&#160;transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. This protocol operates under mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and showcases excellent chemoselectivity, along with broad functional group tolerance. We report for the first time that challenging alkyl donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes can undergo ring expansion leading to aliphatic azetidines without relying on external oxidants or precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium (Mg)&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Characterization of Native Bacterial Biofilms via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization&#8208;Enhanced Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to persistent infections and antimicrobial resistance, posing significant challenges to treatment. However, obtaining high&#8208;resolution structural information on native bacterial biofilms has remained elusive due to the methodological limitations associated with analyzing complex biological samples. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) has shown promise in this regard, but its conventional application is hindered by sensitivity constraints for unlabeled native samples . In this study, we utilized high&#8208;sensitivity Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) ssNMR to characterize native Pseudomonas fluorescens colony biofilms. The ~75&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement provided by DNP enabled structural characterization without the need for isotope labeling or chemical/physical modification. We successfully collected 1D 13C/15N, and 2D 1H&#8208;13C, 1H&#8208;15N and 13C&#8208;13C ssNMR spectra within seconds, minutes or hours, facilitating the identification and quantification of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Additionally, DNP ssNMR allowed quantitative detection of both flexible and rigid biofilm components by favorable freezing conditions. This study represents the first application of ultrasensitive DNP ssNMR to characterize a native bacterial biofilm, significantly expanding the capabilities of ssNMR for analyzing the composition and structure of a wide array of in vitro and ex vivo biofilms. The versatility of this approach will accelerate structure&#8208;guided efforts to combat infections caused by biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Chirality in MoS2 Nanosheets: A Breakthrough in Phase Engineering for Enhanced Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new synthetic strategies to introduce and control chirality in inorganic nanostructures has been highly stimulated by the broad spectrum of potential applications of these exiting nanomaterials. Molybdenum disulfide is among the most investigated transition metal dichalcogenides due to its promising properties for applications that spread from optoelectronic to spintronic. Herein, we report a new two&#8208;step approach for the production of chiroptically active semiconductor 2H MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology based on the manipulation of their crystallographic structure. In the first step, metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology were produced via hydrothermal synthesis. Then, thermal annealing was used to progressively tune the conversion of the metallic 1T phase into the thermodynamically stable semiconductor 2H phase while preserving the nanocrystals&#8217; chiral morphology. Our detailed study covers the evolution of the chiroptical properties of the material during the crystallographic phase transition, revealing critical insights into the formation of chiroptically active excitonic transitions. This study represents a unique approach to the production of high&#8208;quality chiral nanomaterials by exploiting phase engineering, and paves the way for the development of new synthetic methods to further expand the range and properties of important chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Domain Antibodies via a Genetically Encoded &#946;&#8208;Lactam Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Domain antibodies such as monobodies provide an attractive immunoglobin fold for evolving high&#8208;affinity protein binders targeting the intracellular proteins implicated in cell signalling. However, it remains a challenge to endow cell permeability to these small and versatile protein binders. Here, we report a streamlined approach combining orthogonal crosslinking afforded by a genetically encoded &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;lysine (BeLaK) and genetic supercharging to generate cell&#8208;penetrating monobodies. When introduced to the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;strand of a series of supercharged monobodies, BeLaK&#160;enabled efficient inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with the neighbouring lysine. Compared to its non&#8208;crosslinked counterpart, a BeLaK&#8208;crosslinked, +18&#8208;charged monobody exhibited enhanced thermostability and greater cellular uptake at 40 nM. Moreover, this structurally rigidified, supercharged monobody inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in KYSE&#8208;520 esophageal cancer cell line at sub&#8208;micromolar concentration, indicating significant endosomal escape after endocytosis. Together, the discovery of this BeLaK&#8208;encoded, rigidified immunoglobin fold should facilitate the design of cell&#8208;penetrating monobodies targeting intracellular signalling proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable and Low&#8208;energy Synthesis of Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks by a Seed&#8208;mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by low energy input has been a long&#8208;term target for practical applications yet remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed a low&#8208;energy MOF growth strategy at a temperature down to 50 &#176;C by simply introducing seeds into the reaction system. The MOFs are continuously grown on the surface of the seeds at a growth rate dozens of times higher than that of conventional solvothermal synthesis at low temperature, while the resulting MOFs possess high crystallinity, porosity, and stability similar to solvothermal seeds. Remarkably, the obtained MOFs feature high&#8208;density structural defects with Lewis acidity, thereby displaying more than one order of magnitude higher activity than the MOFs obtained by the conventional solvothermal method in the iodination reaction of substituted arenes. This low&#8208;energy synthetic approach is readily scaled up, which would be a significant step forward in the dream of the MOF industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Polymerization toward Poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s as Unique SO2 Generators for Sonodynamic and Gas Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a multicomponent polymerization (MCP) approach involving bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was developed to afford a library of poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimide)s (PPSIs) in high yields and molecular weights, which were further modified to form unique sulfur dioxide (SO2) generators. Bipyrroles served as carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles to undergo Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C coupling during the MCP. Upon post&#8208;MCP modification by transforming the bipyrrole unit to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and the sulfonylimide moiety to sulfonamide, poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s (PBSAs) were obtained as potent anticancer therapeutic agents. This study disclosed the decomposition and SO2&#8208;releasing ability of PBSAs under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Furthermore, one of these polymers having a reactive oxygen species&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker was modified with triethylene glycol chains to give PBSA&#8208;EG, which was further studied for in vitro and in vivo US&#8208;induced anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Upon tail veil administration of PBSA&#8208;EG nanoparticles into tumor&#8208;bearing mice followed by US irradiation, remarkable tumor suppression was observed. This study demonstrates that the innovative and efficient MCP method can construct polymers bearing the BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide moieties, which show a great potential as safe and potent materials for combined gas and sonodynamic therapy against cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly of PROTACs by Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Precision Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) are an innovative strategy for tumor protein degradation, using divided precursors encapsulated in cyclic RGDfC peptide&#8208;modified liposomes (cRGD&#8208;LPs). This system enables in situ self&#8208;assembly to form complete PROTACs within tumors, preventing premature bioorthogonal reactions and enhancing targeting to integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;expressing tumors for precise and efficient degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold immense promise for targeted protein degradation; however, challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, poor drug&#8208;likeness properties, and the &#8220;hook effect&#8221; remain. This study introduces Nano&#8208;Click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) for precise tumor protein degradation in vivo. Traditional PROTACs with high molecular weight were first divided into two smaller druglike precursors capable of self&#8208;assembling to form functional PROTACs through a bioorthogonal reaction. Then, optimal CLIPTACs precursors (W4 and Z2) were encapsulated individually into cyclic RGDfC&#8208;peptide&#8208;modified liposomes to prepare Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs, enabling tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and subsequent in situ self&#8208;assembly to form PROTACs WZ42 within tumor cells. The degradation abilities of Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs in vitro and in vivo were further verified using a key oncology target, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), validating the safety, efficacy and &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; of this strategy. Overall, Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs represent a critical step towards the clinical translation of PROTACs technology for precise targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.

         <title>Enhanced Antitumor Immunity of a Globo H&#8208;Based Vaccine Enabled by the Combination Adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

An adjuvant&#8208;assisted Globo H&#8208;based vaccine platform has been established including semi&#8208;synthetic Globo H&#8208;CRM197 glycoconjugate vaccines formulated with synthetic 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL), saponin QS&#8208;21, &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34 and their combinations. Immunological evaluations suggest that Globo H&#8208;based vaccine formulated with the combination adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21 exhibited an enhanced antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Globo H, a specific carbohydrate antigen overexpressed on various human malignancies, has attracted considerable interest as an antigenic target for anticancer vaccine development. Despite several Globo H&#8208;based carbohydrate vaccines that have been designed, efficient access to Globo H hexasaccharide antigen and development of powerful adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity remain challenging. Herein, we reported a streamlined chemoenzymatic approach to prepare this hexasaccharide antigen, relying on chemical synthesis of Gb5 pentasaccharide by a stereoconvergent [2+3] strategy and subsequent enzymatic &#945;&#8208;fucosylation to easily install &#945;1,2&#8208;fucose residue. Separately, a modular assembly approach to efficiently synthesize 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL) was developed by the integration of stereocontrolled glycosylation, regioselective acylation, site&#8208;specific phosphorylation, and facile global deprotection. After efficient construction of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate, we conducted systematic immunological evaluations of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 formulated with various adjuvants and adjuvant combinations, comprising saponin QS&#8208;21, synthetic 3D&#8208;MPL and &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34. The results revealed that Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate adjuvanted with QS&#8208;21 and 3D&#8208;MPL elicited robust IgG2a and IgG3 antibody responses and Th1 cellular immunity in mice. Moreover, antibodies induced by this formulation effectively bound to Globo H&#8208;positive MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells and exhibited superior complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis, holding promise for further development of effective anticancer vaccines.

         <title>Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free In Situ Generation of Benzylic Nucleophiles Using Tetramethyldisiloxane and Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of Lewis bases and hydrosilanes has recently emerged as a mechanistically diverse manifold to facilitate various defunctionalizations, silylations, and intramolecular rearrangements. This article presents the first example applying this remarkable reagent combination towards intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation. A transition metal&#8208;free hydroalkylation reaction is described, alongside mechanistic experiments that support a plausible pathway wherein the silane acts as both an H atom and electron donor, enabling the synthesis of highly reactive carbanions via reductive radical polar crossover.







Abstract
Hydrosilanes and Lewis bases are known to promote various reductive defunctionalizations, rearrangements, and silylation reactions, facilitated by enigmatic silicon/Lewis base&#8208;derived reactive intermediates. Despite the wide variety of transformations enabled by this reagent combination, no examples of intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) forming reactions have been reported. In this work, we've identified 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and KOtBu as a unique reagent combination capable of generating benzylic nucleophiles in&#8197;situ from styrene derivatives, which can subsequently react with alkyl halides to give a new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) linkage via formal hydroalkylation. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through a key hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step from a hydrosilane reducing agent to styrene, affording a benzylic radical that undergoes reductive radical polar crossover (RRPC) and subsequent SN2 alkylation.

         <title>A 17.73&#8201;% Solar&#8208;To&#8208;Hydrogen Efficiency with Durably Active Catalyst in Stable Photovoltaic&#8208;Electrolysis Seawater System</title>

This study provides a forward&#8208;looking direction for the economically scalable production of green hydrogen and showcases an innovative insight for the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of interfacial&#8208;water dissociation&#8208;oxidation. The photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis system efficiently converts renewable energy sources into hydrogen, the integration of durable RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalyst promises industrial application viability. And the newly defined PVTH parameter sets a new benchmark for photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis systems.







Abstract
Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr&#8208;layered double hydroxide (RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units, in which low&#8208;loading Ru (0.32&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Rulds) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&#8722; repulsion by intercalated CO32&#8722; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ru units. The RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH&#8214;RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Employing RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73&#8201;% STH efficiency, corresponding photovoltaic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37&#8201;%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation&#8208;oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.

         <title>A Universal Design of Lithium Anode via Dynamic Stability Strategy for Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable electroplating technique engineers thin Li metal anode (LMA) with a dual&#8208;layered interphase&#8212;solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI)&#8212;which enhances ionic conductivity and suppresses dendrite formation. This design enables rapid Li+ transport and reduce resistance in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), thus leading to exceptional battery performance and paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SSB with LMA.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery (ASSLB) chemistry with thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) membranes features high energy density and intrinsic safety but suffers from severe dendrite formation and poor interface contact during cycling, which hampers the practical application of rechargeable ASSLB. Here, we propose a universal design of thin Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) via a dynamic stability strategy to address these issues. The ultra&#8208;thin LMA (20&#8197;&#956;m) is in situ constructed with uniform highly Li&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI) via electroplating process. As a result, the passivation layer with poor Li&#8208;ion conduction on Li anode can be dissolved and small surface resistance can be achieved due to the good compatibility of CPI to SSEs. The cycling of Li symmetric cell with Li6PS5Cl thin film electrolyte (&lt;100&#8197;&#956;m) shows a high critical current density of &gt;2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycling stability at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The ASSLBs paring with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode demonstrated the feasibility of engineered LMA design by presenting good rate capability from 0.1&#8197;C to 1.0&#8197;C at room temperature, as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability (81&#8201;% retention after 100&#8197;cycles). This work represents a general pathway to make thin dendrite&#8208;free LMA available for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.

         <title>Access to Polyhydroxyalkanoates with Diverse Syndiotacticity via Polymerization by Spiro&#8208;Salen Complexes and Insights into the Stereocontrol Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiro&#8208;salen catalytic system allows to establish a versatile platform of stereoregular PHA polymers with tunable thermal and mechanical properties which are comparable to commodity plastics. A combined experimental and computational study suggests a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted broad interest as promising sustainable materials to address plastic pollution and resource scarcity. However, the chemical synthesis of stereoregular PHAs via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) has long been an elusive endeavor. In this contribution, we exploited a robust spiro&#8208;salen yttrium complex (Y3) as the catalyst to successfully prepare syndiotactic PHAs with diverse pendent groups. Simply altering the ratio of enantiomeric catalysts allowed to access of PHAs with diverse syndiotacticity (Pr=0.5&#8211;0.99, from sticky oil to tough materials), delivering tunable thermal properties (glass transition temperature, Tg from &#8722;52 to 70&#8201;&#176;C and melting transition temperature, Tm from 38 to 223&#8201;&#176;C). A combined experimental and computational study suggested a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.

         <title>Unprecedented Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Birefringence in Fluorides Constructed from Linear &#960;&#8208;Group Anisotropic Structure Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers the anisotropic structural building unit that encompasses diverse chemical bonds (ABUCB) concept with a novel linear &#960; group to construct the compound Na[BF2(CN)2], which exhibits the record&#8208;high birefringence among deep ultraviolet materials.







Abstract
Advancing laser technologies requires maximizing the anisotropy of crystalline media and overcoming current birefringence limitations. We introduce the strategy of linear &#960; group anisotropic structure building units (ABUCB), leading to an unprecedented large birefringence (&#916;n), a record&#8208;high &#916;nobv. of 0.152 in sodium bis(dicyanoborato)fluoride (Na[BF2(CN)2]), the highest reported among deep ultraviolet (DUV) materials. This value is 35&#8201;% greater than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;BBO and 1167&#8201;% greater than MgF2. Density functional theory analyses suggest that the linear &#960; group enhances bulk optical anisotropy and ensures a shorter DUV absorption edge. These results establish Na[BF2(CN)2] as a groundbreaking DUV birefringent material and open new avenues for research into extending &#960; groups and exploring additional possibilities.

         <title>Synergistic Pathways in PLA Breakdown and PTMC Formation: A One&#8208;Pot Eutectic&#8208;Driven Recycling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PLA is efficiently depolymerized in a one&#8208;pot process. LA formed during degradation creates an eutectic mixture with TMC, enabling milder recycling conditions without extensive drying. The 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;phenolate of potassium catalyzes selective depolymerization, followed by TMC polymerization, yielding lactic acid end&#8208;capped PTMC with high efficiency.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot strategy for the chemical valorization of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), coupling its base&#8208;catalyzed depolymerization with the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC). The process exploits an eutectic mixture of lactide (LA) and TMC, which lowers the thermal input required for PLA degradation. Using potassium aryloxide (KOArtBu) as a bifunctional catalyst, the PLA is first quickly hydrolyzed into oligomers or lactic acid, which subsequently initiate the slower polymerization of TMC. Notably, this transformation operates in the presence of residual water, eliminating the need for tedious drying steps. The method achieves selective PLA breakdown conversion and produces (oligo)lactic acid end&#8208;capped poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) with tunable molar mass, depending on water content.

         <title>Topotactic Transformation in Fe3O4 Induces Spontaneous Growth of Compositionally Diverse Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ambient conditions, the surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) inevitably transforms into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Instead of allowing an oxidation reaction, we use these topotactically transforming Fe3O4 NPs as reducing agents. Merely mixing the Fe3O4 solution with various oxidative metal salts spontaneously generates a variety of compositionally diverse nanostructures under mild conditions.







Abstract
Topotactic transformation is an emerging strategy for synthesizing materials with exotic functional properties. In this report, instead of producing new crystals with related structures, we exploited the topotactic transformation phenomenon to spontaneously produce compositionally diverse nanostructures on the transforming substrate. The surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) is topotactically transformed into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Benefiting from such oxidation susceptibility of ultrasmall Fe3O4 NPs, we achieved spontaneous growth of metals (Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd), a non&#8208;metal (Se), and a metal oxide (MnO2) based nanostructures onto the surface of Fe3O4. No spontaneous growth of nanostructures was observed when the oxidized Fe3O4 NPs were tested, likely due to the loss of the Fe2+&#8208;associated mobile electrons. The obtained nanostructures displayed appreciable antioxidant activities, which we utilized to effectively treat inflammation in the intestines. It is anticipated that this synthetic route, based on topotactic transformation, represents a significant advancement in synthesizing various chemically diverse hetero&#8208;nanostructures.

Benefiting from such oxidation susceptibility of ultrasmall Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs, we achieved spontaneous growth of metals (Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd), a non-metal (Se), and a metal oxide (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) based nanostructures onto the surface of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. No spontaneous growth of nanostructures was observed when the oxidized Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs were tested, likely due to the loss of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-associated mobile electrons. The obtained nanostructures displayed appreciable antioxidant activities, which we utilized to effectively treat inflammation in the intestines. It is anticipated that this synthetic route, based on topotactic transformation, represents a significant advancement in synthesizing various chemically diverse hetero-nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sugar Auxiliary Group Assisted Diversity&#8208;Oriented Enzymatic Modular Synthesis of 0&#8208;Series Ganglioside Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sugar auxiliary group assisted chain&#8208;elongation strategy was developed to overcome the limitation of bacterial &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase CjCgtA for the enzymatic synthesis of extended 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures. These core structures were then applied in the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain 0&#8208;series of ganglioside glycans by sequential glycosylation with a total of 8 enzyme modules.







Abstract
Owing to the inaccessibility of &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase for direct glycan chain elongation, the enzymatic synthesis of 0&#8208;series gangliosides with extended backbones has not been explored. In this study, sialic acid was enzymatically introduced as an auxiliary group to overcome the limitation of substrate specificity of Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CjCgtA) to achieve the synthesis of desired extended 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures, and the sialic acid auxiliary group could be removed by sialidase at appropriate stages. A bacterial &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium damselae (Pd2,6ST) exhibited unexpected acceptor substrate specificity for 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures, providing ready access to complex gangliosides bearing the sialyl N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine unit. The 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures as the key acceptor substrates were further diversified by sequential enzymatic modular assembly to generate a collection of 31&#8197;complex 0&#8208;series ganglioside glycans after removal of the sugar auxiliary group of sialic acid at the appropriate stage.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanomachines for Intracellular Targeted Electrochemiluminescence Imaging in Single Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimulus&#8208;responsive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineered nanomachine (RuMOF@DNAgel) was developed to trigger DNA hydrogel shell depolymerization based on the target, and realize controllable ECL imaging analysis of intracellular target biomolecules distribution with 3D spatial resolution. This study provides a reliable strategy for ECL imaging of target intracellular molecules with high selectivity, which could be able to provide more elegant information in microscopy imaging and cellular biology.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for single&#8208;cell imaging owing to its unparalleled background&#8208;free imaging advantages. However, controlled intracellular ECL imaging remains challenging. Here, we developed a stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembled DNA nanomachine that enables the ECL imaging of intracellular target biomolecules in single cells. The ECL nanoprobe consists of an ECL nanoemitter constructed from Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework as the nanoreactor core, with a DNA polymer hydrogel (DNAgel) shell acting as the stimuli&#8208;gated layer. The outer functionalized DNAgel of the ECL nanoprobe was specifically designed to block ECL generation and to dissociate by ATP molecules, thereby enabling selective recovery of ECL emission capability. Such an engineered stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomachine successfully achieved the targeted ECL imaging of intracellular ATP distribution with spatial resolution. In addition, ECL imaging of various intracellular biomolecules should be generalizable by simply changing the switching DNA sequence of the probe. Our research provided a reliable strategy for ECL microscopy within cells, which will broaden the application of ECL in single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule profiling.

         <title>Thermal Modulation of Exciton Recombination for High&#8208;Temperature Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) in a metal&#8208;free doping system was developed by leveraging a meticulously crafted synergy of thermally electron releasing, Dexter energy transfer, and electron&#8208;hole recombination, which marks the first instance of a tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA with lifetime of 1.04&#8197;s even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and a rigidity&#8208;induced yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Developing smart materials with tunable high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) luminescence remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a metal&#8208;free doping system using boric acid as matrix and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as dopants. This composition achieves dynamically tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA lasting for over ten seconds even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and an ultra&#8208;long yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence below 110&#8201;&#176;C. The observed HTA is attributed to the thermally released exciton recombination within the dopant molecules, which shows excellent temperature tolerance compared to traditional triplet related phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The planarity of dopants is extensively investigated playing a pivotal role in modulating Dexter electron transfer (ET) for capturing released electrons and thereby affecting the overall performance of tunable HTA. This work provides an efficient and universal doping strategy to engineer tunable HTA through the synergistic action of thermally releasing electrons, Dexter ET and exciton recombination.

         <title>Deciphering pH Mismatching at the Electrified Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface towards Understanding Intrinsic Water Molecule Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating operando electrochemical methods with (micro)kinetic modelling, the dynamic local pH effect for the oxygen evolution reaction is clarified. An unconventional reversible hydrogen reference electrode is employed, enabling a clearer interpretation of intrinsic electrochemical kinetics. This approach offers deeper insights into the microscopic electrode processes in the electrified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with dynamic local pH.







Abstract
Unveiling the key influencing factors towards electrode/electrolyte interface control is a long&#8208;standing challenge for a better understanding of microscopic electrode kinetics, which is indispensable to building up guiding principles for designer electrocatalysts with desirable functionality. Herein, we exemplify the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water molecule oxidation with the iridium dioxide electrocatalyst and uncovered the significant mismatching effect of pH between local electrode surface and bulk electrolyte: the intrinsic OER activity under acidic or near&#8208;neutral condition was deciphered to be identical by adjusting this pH mismatching. This result indicates that the local pH effect at the electrified solid&#8211;liquid interface plays the main role in the &#8220;fake&#8221; OER performance. This local pH effect on the OER electrode process is further verified by integrating a wide spectrum of analytical approaches. This study will accelerate the understanding of the local proton&#8208;induced effect on electrode interface processes and the development of advanced electrochemical activity.

         <title>Cooperative Multiscale&#8208;Assembly for Directional and Hierarchical Growth of Highly Oriented Porous Organic Cage Single&#8208;Crystal Microtubes and Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly method for porous organic cages that controls intermolecular interactions and fluid flow across scales, directing the growth of single&#8208;crystal tubular structures with oriented micropores and defined dimensionality. These nanocage&#8208;based architectures enhance chemoenzymatic reactions by compartmentalizing metal clusters and enzymes, offering powerful efficiency in complex catalysis.







Abstract
The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long&#8208;range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double&#8208;solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single&#8208;crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single&#8208;crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro&#8208; and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold enhancement in one&#8208;pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.

These nanocage-based architectures enhance chemoenzymatic reactions by compartmentalizing metal clusters and enzymes, offering powerful efficiency in complex catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long-range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale-assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double-solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single-crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single-crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro- and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8- to 4-fold enhancement in one-pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imperfections Immobilization and Regeneration in Perovskite with Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Assembly for Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly of nickel octaethylporphyrin in perovskite films serves a dual function: acting as an immobilizer for volatile iodine produced by iodide oxidation and as a redox shuttle to regenerate impurities such as elemental lead and iodine. Modified devices without encapsulation exhibit significantly enhanced performance and stability. These findings highlight the potential of redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite photovoltaics.







Abstract
Imperfections in metal halide perovskites, such as those induced by light exposure or thermal stress, compromise device performance and stability. A key challenge is immobilizing volatile iodine produced by iodide oxidation and regenerating impurities like elemental lead and iodine. Here, we address this by integrating a redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly of nickel octaethylporphyrin into perovskite film, functioning as both an immobilizer and redox shuttle. Decorated ethyl groups in porphyrin distorts the &#960; ring, increasing the axial ligand adsorption capacity of central metal ion, while reducing intermolecular interactions and promoting iodine adsorption achieving a maximum uptake of 3.83&#8197;mg&#8201;mg&#8722;1 to iodine. Adsorbed iodine transfers more electrons to Ni ions, leading to a weakened interaction within I&#8722;I bond and facilitating the production of iodide ions. Such a situation further enables selective oxidation of metallic lead defects to Pb2+. Porphyrin supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grain boundaries, leading to a champion device efficiency of 25.37&#8201;% for a 0.10&#8197;cm2 active area, outperforms the value of control device being 23.96&#8201;%. Modified devices without encapsulation exhibit significantly enhanced stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial performance after 1,000&#8197;hours of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Electrolyte chemistry towards ultra&#8208;high voltage (4.7 V) and ultra&#8208;wide temperature (&#8722;30 to 70 &#176;C) LiCoO2 batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiCoO2 batteries for 3C electronics demand high charging voltage and wide operating temperature range, which are virtually impossible for existing electrolytes due to aggravated interfacial parasitic reactions and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester solvent (i.e., DFEA) that achieves a balance between weak Li+&#8211;solvent interactions, sufficient salt dissociation, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability to address the aforementioned challenges. The resulting high&#8208;voltage wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte (HWE) not only possesses low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high oxidation stability, excellent thermal&#8208;abuse tolerance and non&#8208;flammability, but also enables the formation of both inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Owing to the above merits, this HWE endows the highly stable operation of LiCoO2 cathodes under an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.7 V and Graphite||LiCoO2 batteries in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;30 to 70 &#176;C. Meanwhile, a 1.7 Ah&#8208;level 4.6 V Graphite||LiCoO2 pouch cell with a high energy density of 240 Wh kg&#8722;1 also delivers excellent cycling stability, representing a significant advancement in the design of electrolytes towards ultra&#8208;high voltage and ultra&#8208;wide temperature batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyurethane Elastomers Strengthened by Pseudo[1]rotaxanes Based on Pillararenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based pseudo[1]rotaxane is introduced into a linear polyurethane to prepare a class of polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. It is found that intramolecular sliding motions of the pseudo[1]rotaxane can greatly improve the mechanical properties of polyurethane elastomers.







Abstract
As a unique property of the interlocked structures, rotaxane allows for intramolecular motions between its wheel and axle components. Introduction of rotaxanes into polymers can endow them with distinctive macroscopic features and outstanding mechanical properties. Here, we prepare a copillar[5]arene with a hydroxyl and an amino&#8208;group on each end, which can spontaneously form a pseudo[1]rotaxane through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This pseudo[1]rotaxane possesses a releasable extra alkyl chain, which is then incorporated into a linear polyurethane by reacting with a diisocyanate to prepare polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. The results of stress&#8208;strain test and dynamic mechanical analysis all indicate that sliding motions of the axle part on the pseudo[1]rotaxane in the polymer skeleton can greatly dissipate energy, which endows the elastomers with higher toughness and better fatigue resistance. Moreover, the addition of moderate amount of cuprous bromide to form cuprous&#8208;thioether coordination in the polymers can further improve the mechanical properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optogenetic systems using photosensitive proteins and chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) approaches enabled by chemical dimerizers (also termed molecular glues), are powerful tools to elucidate the dynamics of biological systems and to dissect complex biological regulatory networks. Here, we report a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular, photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that can undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally design the sMGs and further expand their scope by incorporating different photoswitches, resulting in sMGs with customizable properties. We demonstrate that this system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision. This system enables sophisticated optical manipulation of cellular processes and thus opens up a new avenue for chemo&#8208;optogenetics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Li metal batteries (LMBs), particularly with a limited Li metal anode and a 5V&#8208;class cathode, offer significantly higher energy density compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the limited Li anode poses severe challenges to cycling stability due to low efficiency and large volume expansion issues associated with Li. Herein, we design a lightweight and functionalized host composed of Sn nanoparticles embedded into necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs) toward anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class LMBs. The macroporous framework can decrease the local current density to homogenize Li deposition and release structural stress to realize high areal capacity of over 40 mAh cm&#8208;2. The lithiophilic B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon and Sn nanoparticles can function as high&#8208;affinity Li binding sites to uniformize Li nucleus growth on the internal and external surface of hollow fibers. Accordingly, the Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs enable stable dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for 1700 h even in the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. When coupled with a 5V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode, the assembled anode&#8208;less pouch cell also displays stable cycling performance even under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanoflowers on Nickel Hollow Fiber for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable energy&#8208;driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere&#8208;level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large&#8208;scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three&#8208;dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99% and a CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93% at 2 A cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94% for 520 h at a current density of 3 A cm&#8208;2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and Sn&#8208;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom Porosity Tuning in Calixarene&#8208;Derived Porous Liquids via Supramolecular Complexation Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level porosity engineering, which is appealing in gas separations, has been demonstrated in solid carbon, polymer, and framework materials but rarely achieved in the liquid phase. In this work, a gas molecular sieving effect in the liquid phase at sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom scale is created via sophisticated porosity tuning in calixarene&#8208;derived porous liquids (PLs). Type II PLs are constructed via supramolecular complexation between the sodium salts of calixarene derivatives and crown ether solvents. The chemical structure variation and assembly behavior of the porous host upon PL construction are monitored by spectroscopy&#8208;, X&#8208;ray&#8208;, and neutron&#8208;scattering techniques. The presence of permanent porosity in calixarene&#8208;derived PLs is verified by pressure swing gas uptake, altered CO2 physisorption behavior, and dynamic theoretical simulation. Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning within the PL phase is achieved by introducing bulky substituted groups on the benzene ring of the calixarene host, which then greatly affects the dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 molecules and the Xe uptake performance. The approach being demonstrated in this work represents a promising pathway to tune and leverage the porosity effect for enhanced gas uptake capacity and selectivity in liquid sorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Metalloenzymes with Two Catalytic Cofactors for Tandem Abiotic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) enable the integration of abiotic cofactors within a native protein scaffold, allowing for non&#8208;natural catalytic activities. Previous ArMs, however, have primarily relied on single cofactor systems, limiting them to only one catalytic function. Here we present an approach to construct ArMs embedding two catalytic cofactors based on the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology. By incorporating multiple catalytic cofactors into the four binding sites of streptavidin, we engineered programmable ArMs for tandem abiotic transformations including an enantioselective formal C&#8211;H hydroxylation and a photooxidation&#8208;Michael addition. This work thus outlines a promising strategy for the development of ArMs embedding multiple cofactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Carbon Materials: Tailoring Chemistry and Electronic Properties to Improve Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of versatile strategies for preparing functional carbon materials is essential for advancing a wide range of applications in materials science. Precursor design plays a pivotal role in governing the chemistry and structure of carbon materials for target applications. In this work, we report the synthesis of Meldrum&#8217;s acid derivatives through Knoevenagel condensation with aromatic heterocycles such as pyrrole, furan, and thiophene, which serve as precursors for carbonaceous materials with tailored chemical and electronic properties. The thermal condensation of these precursors proceeds via highly reactive, electron&#8208;rich ketene intermediates, playing a crucial role in the formation of the carbon materials. The resulting heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials exhibit tunable chemical, physico&#8208;chemical, and structural properties, which we have correlated with their energy storage performances. Eventually, we deem this strategy of high interest for designing high&#8208;performance carbonaceous materials with tunable properties for a broad range of applications, from electrochemical energy storage to conversion, water filtration, environmental remediation, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthorhombic Covalent Organic Frameworks with fmj Topology as Photocatalyst for&#160;Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), a class of highly porous crystalline polymers, have exhibited great potentials in many applications. However, the reported topologies of 3D COFs have been limited to high&#8208;symmetry crystal systems, which significantly hindered the development of such functional materials. Herein, we demonstrate the first construction of four highly crystalline orthorhombic 3D COFs with an unprecedented fmj topology, based on judiciously choosing rotatable monomers. Notably, the square monomers in the unit cell of the fmj topological network adopt three different conformations, resulting in a highly complicated 3D network. Moreover, an isomeric pair (3DCOF&#8208;CN and 3DCOF&#8208;NC), differing only in the orientations of &#8208;C=N&#8208; bonds, exhibit distinct optoelectronic properties, protonation abilities, and photocatalytic activities, which is the first time to reveal such isomeric effects in 3D COFs. Particularly, a difference of 32&#8208;fold in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was observed for the two isomers, with one achieving a superb rate up to ~31.1 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1. This work achieves the first construction of complex orthorhombic 3D COFs, and offers new insights for the development of 3D COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Modulation Doping in Van der Waals Layered Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process, necessitating catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity to enhance its kinetic rate. Van der Waals layered oxides are ideal materials for catalyst design, yet its stability for acidic OER remains large obstacle. Doping provides a crucial way to improve the activity and stability simultaneously. However, doping in Van der Waals layered oxides remains a great challenge since it easily leads to lattice distortion or even the crystal structure damage. In this work, we successfully doping acid&#8208;resistant niobium (Nb) into Van der Waals layered edge&#8208;shared 1T phase iridium oxide (1T&#8208;IrO2) via alkali&#8208;assisted thermal method. 1T&#8208;IrO2 with a 5% Nb doping (Nb0.05Ir0.95O2) only required an overpotential of 191 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 56 mV lower than that of 1T&#8208;IrO2. When applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Nb0.05Ir0.95O2 achieved a current density of 1.2 A cm&#8208;2 at a cell voltage of 1.7 V&#160;for 50 days. Density functional theory calculation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential&#8208;determining step from the *OOH deprotonation process in 1T&#8208;IrO2 to the *O&#8208;OH coupling process in Nb0.05Ir0.95O2.</dc:description>

When applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Nb0.05Ir0.95O2 achieved a current density of 1.2 A cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.7 V&#160;for 50 days. Density functional theory calculation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential-determining step from the *OOH deprotonation process in 1T-IrO2 to the *O-OH coupling process in Nb0.05Ir0.95O2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radar&#8208;Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Compatible Stealth Coaxial Silver Nanowire@Carbon Nano&#8208;cable Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth in radar&#8208;terahertz&#8208;infrared bands with robust performance has great prospects for both military and civilian applications. However, the progress of materials encounters substantial challenges due to the significant variability in frequency coupling properties across different electromagnetic wave bands. Here, this work presents the design of a multi&#8208;scale structure and fabricates a lightweight aerogel (silver nanowire@carbon, AgNW@C) consisting of a regular coaxial nano&#8208;cable, with silver nanowire as the core and amorphous&#8208;graphitized hybrid carbon as the outer&#8208;layer. The design utilizes the one&#8208;dimensional conductive network and electric coupling heterogeneous interface, the low infrared emission of silver nanowires, and the thermal insulation caused by three&#8208;dimensional pore structure found in aerogels. This conception achieves the long&#8208;standing goal of multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth in an integrated material. The AgNW@C aerogel exhibits an optimal reflection loss of &#8208;66.50 dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 8.80 GHz in the gigahertz band, while an average total shielding performance of 71.92 dB and over 50.00 dB reflection loss in the terahertz band. Furthermore, the&#160; aerogel demonstrates remarkable infrared stealth capabilities with a low infrared emissivity of 0.28 and thermal insulation up to 150&#8451; under 200&#8451;. These exceptional properties allow the aerogel for potential applications in&#160;electromagnetic protection.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a complex post&#8208;translational modification involved in key physiological processes and associated with various health and disease states. The growing interest in ADP&#8208;ribosylation necessitates straightforward and efficient synthetic methods for the preparation of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins. In this study, we report a facile reaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and alcohols promoted by a combination of ionic liquids, yielding up to 94% with &#945;:&#946; ratios ranging from 88:12 to 99:1 and a switchable configuration selectivity. This method significantly simplifies the production of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides and proteins, enabling diverse applications. It allows detailed investigation of side&#8208;chain structure&#8208;activity relationships, facilitates two&#8208;step clickable conjugation of ADP&#8208;ribosyl groups to proteins, and, for the first time, enables non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins from natural counterparts and NAD+.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships for s&#8208;Block Metal/Co(III) Heterodinuclear Catalysts in Cyclohexene Oxide Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In homogeneous catalysis, uncovering structure&#8208;activity relationships remains very rare but invaluable to understand and rationally improve performances. Here, generalizable structure&#8208;activity relationships apply to a series of heterodinuclear polymerization catalysts featuring Co(III) and s&#8208;block metals M(I/II) (M= Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Sr(II), Ba(II)). These are shown to apply to polycarbonate production by the ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), conducted at high (20 bar) and low (1 bar) CO2 pressures, and to polyester production by copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and phthalic anhydride (PA). For the CHO/PA and high&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerizations, activity increases exponentially with s&#8208;block metal acidity peaking at the Co(III)K(I) catalyst, whilst for the low&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerization it increases linearly to the same metal combination. The polymerization kinetics fit second order rate laws and the correlations support dinuclear metallate mechanistic hypotheses. These relationships help understand and identify key metal complex structural features in synergic polymerization catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Evaporation Enthalpy Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting at Low Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic COFs with numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability were developed, achieving efficient water vapor adsorption and low enthalpy of evaporation at low humidity, offering cost&#8208;effective solutions for fresh water collection in desert regions.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25&#8201;%. These iCOFs are characterized by numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability, enabling efficient water vapor adsorption even at relatively low humidity levels. Through the use of various hygroscopic salt cations and precise control of ion concentration within the pores, the water state within the iCOFs pores can be effectively managed. Among the iCOFs, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li stands out with an impressive adsorption capacity of 0.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 from 0 to 22&#8201;% RH. Notably, due to its ionic porous structure, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li exhibits a significantly lower enthalpy of evaporation, measured at 967.04&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1, compared to bulk water with an enthalpy of 2387.40&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, under simulated conditions of 1.5 solar intensity at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the majority of the adsorbed water can be rapidly desorbed without the need for additional energy input. This efficient desorption process contributes to a high water collection rate of 0.092&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the final atmospheric water harvesting device. The development of these iCOFs offers a promising and cost&#8208;effective solution for obtaining fresh water in arid regions.

         <title>Complementary Reducing Agents are Responsible for Temporally Distinct Nucleation and Growth Phases During the Polyol Synthesis of Ag Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) end&#8208;groups are shown to initiate nucleation in the polyol synthesis of silver nanocubes. The rate of nucleation (k1) is smaller than digestion by O2/Cl&#8722; (k&#8208;1) until air is removed, but larger than growth of the cubes (k2), which is critical for maintaining shape control. Nuclei number density is controlled only by PVP end&#8208;group concentration, independent of Ag+ concentration. Selectivity to cubes requires a narrow window of particle number density due to the autocatalytic growth mechanism.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol or one of its oxidation products are believed to serve as reducing agents in the shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of Ag nanocubes (NCs) by the polyol process. The identity of end&#8208;groups of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) impacts shape control with alcohol and aldehyde moieties serving as a primary Ag reducing agent. We explored the role of PVP end&#8208;groups in the polyol process by measuring the dependence of particle number density of Ag NCs produced on the initial concentration(s) of Ag and PVP using small angle x&#8208;ray scattering and statistically large particle size distributions analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The number density of Ag NCs is strongly dependent on the starting concentration of PVP chains demonstrating PVP end&#8208;groups play an important role in the nucleation of NCs. The concentration of Ag+ is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the end&#8208;groups suggesting ethylene glycol must participate in the reduction of Ag+ during growth. Perturbation experiments and analysis of resultant particle size distribution reveal nucleation is fast relative to growth of NCs, reinforcing the synergy between PVP end&#8208;groups and ethylene glycol. The evidence demonstrates PVP end&#8208;groups and ethylene glycol are tandem reducing agents operative in temporally distinct phases of the polyol synthesis of Ag NCs.

         <title>Calcium Chemistry as A New Member of Post&#8208;Lithium Battery Family: What Can We Learn from Sodium and Magnesium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium batteries are promising post&#8208;lithium technology featuring high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost and sustainability. According to the periodic table, Ca has similar physicochemical properties with Na and Mg in some aspects. This review discusses the similarity and difference between Ca and the other two more matured battery chemistries, hoping to provide new insights into the transport and storage mechanisms that accelerate the development of the emerging technology.







Abstract
The development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies needs to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth&#8208;abundant elements into the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca0/Ca2+ redox chemistry in non&#8208;aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post&#8208;lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca&#8208;ions can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems. We hope the discussion will inspire synergetic development between Ca batteries and other post&#8208;lithium systems.

         <title>3,6&#8208;Bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methylthiocarbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acid, MeS&#8208;4PACz, capable of forming a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide has been developed. The molecule induces an interfacial dipole and passivates iodide vacancies in FAPbI3 perovskite. Inverted perovskite solar cells using MeS&#8208;4PACz SAM as a hole&#8208;selective layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.134&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule&#8216;s methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.13&#8201;%, along with outstanding photostability.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering of Chalcogen&#8208;Bridged Chiral Molecules for Efficient OLEDs with Diverse Luminescence Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing isomeric molecular engineering to tune electronic and vibrational spin&#8208;orbital coupling effects, several chiral molecules have been developed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The TADF&#8208;based OLEDs achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;%, and by modulating the TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission has been realized.







Abstract
The exploration of circularly polarized luminescence is important for advancing display and lighting technologies. Herein, by utilizing isomeric molecular engineering, a novel series of chiral molecules are designed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The cooperation of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, moderate spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC), and large oscillator strength enables efficient TADF emission, with photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. By altering the symmetry of molecular structures, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic electronic SOC and vibrational SOC effects can be greatly enhanced to facilitate RTP emission. Notably, through modulating simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission is successfully achieved. Accordingly, the TADF&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 30&#8201;%, representing exceptional performance of non&#8208;aromatic amine&#8208;based emitters. Furthermore, the first single&#8208;molecule white OLED based on TADF and RTP dual&#8208;emissive chiral material is developed, establishing a benchmark for the development of advanced display and lighting technologies.

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space Through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we develop an automated reasoning method, COMGEN to determine valid compositions for a given set of domain expert defined constraints. We demonstrate the method in an automated workflow with crystal structure prediction and properties models to locate and predict new potential Li&#8208;ion solid state electrolytes.







Abstract
The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen's outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end&#8208;to&#8208;end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation. This highlights the potential of automated formal reasoning in materials chemistry.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Divergent Cyclization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the solvent&#8208;dependent divergent 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes were achieved. This protocol straightforwardly led to a diverse range of oxa&#8208;bicyclic heptanes, which may serve as lead bioisosteres in drug discovery, as well as highly functionalized cyclobutanes with exceptional diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic investigation revealed that solvent effects dominate the reaction pathway, as the rate of acid&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of BCBs varies with different solvents. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reactions and various post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the products demonstrated their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently garnered significant research interest as versatile precursors for synthesizing potential [n.1.1] bioisosteres and multi&#8208;functionalized cyclobutanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical manner. Here, we report a solvent&#8208;dependent divergent cyclization of BCBs that provides highly diastereospecific decorated cyclobutanes and oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which serve as bioisosteres of meta&#8208;substituted arenes. Additionally, an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction mode for BCBs was explored, thus expanding the chemical space of arene bioisosteres and highly functionalized cyclobutanes.

Here, we report a solvent-dependent divergent cyclization of BCBs that provides highly diastereospecific decorated cyclobutanes and oxygen-containing bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which serve as bioisosteres of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-substituted arenes. Additionally, an unprecedented 1,2-difunctionalization reaction mode for BCBs was explored, thus expanding the chemical space of arene bioisosteres and highly functionalized cyclobutanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating p&#8208;&#960; Resonance through Methoxy Group Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for an Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically modulating the position and quantity of &#8722;OMe units, we can precisely manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, resulting in enhanced charge carrier kinetics and mitigated mass transfer resistance in COF&#8208;OMe&#8208;3 with para&#8208;dimethoxy substitution. Consequently, these modifications lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction efficiency.







Abstract
Kinetic factors frequently emerge as the primary constraints in photocatalysis, exerting a critical influence on the efficacy of polymeric photocatalysts. The diverse conjugation systems within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can significantly impact photon absorption, energy level structures, charge separation and migration kinetics. Consequently, these limitations often manifest as unsatisfactory kinetic behavior, which adversely affects the photocatalytic activity of COFs. To address these challenges, we propose a methoxy (&#8722;OMe) molecular engineering strategy designed to enhance charge carrier kinetics and mitigate mass transfer resistance. Through strategic modulation of the position and quantity of &#8722;OMe units, we can effectively manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, thereby enhancing charge separation and migration. Moreover, COFs enriched with &#8722;OMe moieties exhibit enhanced mass transfer dynamics due to the hydrophilic nature of methoxy groups, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products within the porous structure. This approach is hypothesized to drive an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing 2D Anion&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Temperature Water Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing halogen anions as connecting nodes, new 2D reticulate honeycomb anion&#8208;organic frameworks were synthesized through a simple, green in situ protonation and crystallization method using pyridine&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine derivatives. These frameworks feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal channels and exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing properties, high water uptake, and low water release onset temperatures.







Abstract
Molecular frameworks have recently shown a great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, in which the water release at low temperatures is challenging. Anion&#8208;organic frameworks based on anion&#8208;coordination chemistry are presented herein to meet this challenge. These frameworks are prepared as tubular single crystals in pure water from the in situ protonation and crystallization of pyridine&#8208;terminated triphenylamine derivatives with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7&#8211;2.3&#8197;nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water&#8208;stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self&#8208;healing capability. This discovery opens opportunities for the design and synthesis of flexible and self&#8208;healing frameworks for porosity&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Achieving Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation via an Enzymatic Pathway on a Distorted CoP4 Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated. The N2 adsorption pattern on the Co&#8208;SAC switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation over semiconductors has always suffered from poor conversion efficiency owing to weak N2 adsorption and the difficulty of N&#8801;N triple bond dissociation. Herein, a Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) model with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated using a selective phosphidation strategy, wherein P&#8208;doping and C defects co&#8208;regulate the local electronic structure of Co sites. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the distorted CoP4 configuration caused a strong charge redistribution between the Co atoms and adjacent C atoms, minimizing their electronegativity difference. Consequently, the N2 adsorption pattern switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode with a high N2 adsorption energy of &#8722;1.40&#8197;eV and an elongated N&#8722;N bond length of 1.20&#8197;&#197;, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway. The NH3 yielding rate peaked at 1249.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.51&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Moreover, the selective phosphidation strategy has universality for synthesizing other SACs, such as those containing Ni and Fe. This study offers new insight into co&#8208;regulating the electronic structure of SACs for efficient photocatalytic overall N2 fixation.

         <title>Ultrafast Tailoring Amorphous Zn0.25V2O5 with Precision&#8208;Engineered Artificial Atomic&#8208;Layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 cathode, with an atomic&#8208;layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 coating, is ultrafast and efficiently synthesized through a colloidal chemical strategy to achieve superior AZIB performance. The amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO and MoS2 artificial interphase synergistically provide more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics while effectively suppressing structural degradation and V&#8208;dissolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes.







Abstract
Vanadium (V)&#8208;based oxides as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) still encounter challenges such as sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and V&#8208;dissolution, thus leading to severe capacity fading and limited life span. Here, we designed an ultrafast and facile colloidal chemical synthesis strategy based on crystalline Zn0.25V2O5 (c&#8208;ZVO) to successfully prepare a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 core@shell heterostructures, where atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 uniformly coats on the surface of amorphous a&#8208;ZVO. The tailored amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO provides more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, thus significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Meanwhile, as an efficient artificial cathode electrolyte interphase, the precision&#8208;engineered atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 with semi&#8208;metallic 1T&#8242; phase not only contributes to improved electron transport but also effectively inhibits the V&#8208;dissolution of a&#8208;ZVO. Therefore, the prepared a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 and conceptually validated a&#8208;V2O5@MoS2 derived from commercial c&#8208;V2O5 exhibit excellent cycling stability at an ultralow current density (0.05&#8197;A g&#8722;1) while maintaining good rate capability and capacity retention. This research achievement provides a new effective strategy for various amorphous cathode designs for AZIBs with superior performance.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;throughput screening, natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) was identified as a novel STING antagonist. A concise and scalable total synthesis was accomplished in 6&#8197;steps based on an efficient acid&#8208;promoted tandem deprotection/cyclization reaction to build the pentacyclic structure. Enabled by total synthesis, the therapeutic potential of ATS was elucidated, which lays the foundation for developing an STING antagonist as an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases.







Abstract
Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6&#8197;steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS's mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients. ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS&#8208;induced IBD colitis and Trex1&#8208;/&#8208; autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules is enhanced by the introduction of electron donors, which makes it easier to coordinate with Li+. This greatly weakens the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in the ester&#8208;based electrolyte to more than 0.5&#8197;M. The Li|| LiFePO4 batteries with such electrolyte exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designable electrochemiluminescence patterning is achieved by focusing a 730&#8197;nm laser beam on the electrode surface. Through an in situ photothermal effect generated by the laser, which removes oxides formed by anodization, this approach enables enhanced bioimaging, highly sensitive immunoassays, and reversible luminescence&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.

         <title>Thermally Assisted Microfluidics to Produce Chemically Equivalent Microgels with Tunable Network Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally assisted microfluidics is utilized to produce thermoresponsive microgels with different network structures and morphologies. Monomers or star&#8208;polymers are used as microgel precursors at different temperatures. Microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offer a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Although micron&#8208;sized microgels have become important building blocks in regenerative materials, offering decisive interactions with living matter, their chemical composition mostly significantly varies when their network morphology is tuned. Since cell behavior is simultaneously affected by the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the gel network, microgels with variable morphology but chemical equivalence are of interest. This work describes a new method to produce thermoresponsive microgels with defined mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and volume phase transition temperatures. A wide variety of microgels is synthesized by crosslinking monomers or star polymers at different temperatures using thermally assisted microfluidics. The diversification of microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offers a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures. The method holds high potential to create soft and dynamic materials while maintaining the chemical composition for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine.

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanocatalytic antioxidation approach is proposed for alcoholic liver injury therapy by developing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with a desirable hepatic passive targeting ability, as well as a high catalytic antioxidative activity, resulting in an efficient and sustainable ROS&#8208;scavenging effect in the liver.







Abstract
The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km=59.31&#8197;mM).

&lt;p&gt;A novel nanocatalytic antioxidation approach is proposed for alcoholic liver injury therapy by developing amorphous Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with a desirable hepatic passive targeting ability, as well as a high catalytic antioxidative activity, resulting in an efficient and sustainable ROS-scavenging effect in the liver.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxo)Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxo)Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OH)Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OH) favorable for catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Curvature&#8208;Induced Electron Spin Catalysis with Carbon Spheres</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid carbon spheres, synthesized by using molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule in a radical coupling reaction, exhibit curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis. Inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance spectra show that the curvature spin of the carbon is an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radicals.







Abstract
Here, we report curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis by using solid carbon spheres as catalysts, which were synthesized using positive curvature molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule, following a radical coupling mechanism. The curvature spin of carbon is regarded as an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radical, which is identified by the inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance. The growth mechanism of carbon spheres abiding by Kroto's model, is supported by the density functional theory study of thermodynamics and kinetics calculations. The solid carbon spheres present excellent catalytic behaviour of oxidation coupling of amines to form corresponding imines with the conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, selectivity of 98.7&#8201;%, and yield of 97.7&#8201;%, which is attributed to the predominantly curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis of carbon, supported by the calculation of oxygen adsorption energy. This work proposes a view of curvature&#8208;induced spin catalysis of carbon, which opens up a research direction for curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis.

         <title>Helmholtz Plane Regulation Empowers PF6&#8722; Permselectivity Towards High Coulombic Efficiency Dual Ion Battery of 5.5&#8197;V</title>

         <dc:description>
Hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) was developed as a functional electrolyte additive to improve high&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) performance. HFGA can positively regulate anion solvation behaviors and participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity near the graphite electrode surface. Such strengths enable a 5.5&#8197;V DIB with 92&#8201;% capacity retention and &gt;99&#8201;% average Coulombic efficiency within 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) is promising for stationary energy storage applications owing to its cost&#8208;effectiveness, which has been a hot topic of research in rechargeable battery fields. However, it still suffers from rapid battery failure caused by the severe solvent co&#8208;intercalation and electrolyte oxidation. To address these bottlenecks, herein a functional electrolyte additive hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) is presented based on a Helmholtz plane regulation strategy. It is demonstrated that the HFGA can precisely enter into the Helmholtz plane and positively regulate anion solvation behaviors near the graphite electrode surface owing to its considerable H&#8722;F affinity with ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), thus alleviating EMC&#8208;related co&#8208;intercalation and oxidation decomposition during DIB charging. Meanwhile, HFGA can copolymerize with the presence of PF5 at the Helmholtz plane to participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity, conducive to achieving PF6&#8722; de&#8208;solvation and simultaneously suppressing electrolyte oxidation decomposition. By virtue of such beneficial effects, the graphite cathode enables a 5.5&#8197;V DIB with a prominent capacity retention of 92&#8201;% and a high average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% within 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced electrochemical reversibility. The Helmholtz plane regulation strategy marks a milestone in advancing DIB technologies.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Additive&#8208;Modulated Interfacial Microenvironment Boosting CO2 Electrolysis in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing polystyrene sulfonate into acidic electrolytes induces a local high concentrations of potassium ions at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface through electrostatic attraction, promoting the efficient electrolysis of CO2. Hydrogen&#8211;bonds formed between sulfonic acid groups and hydrated protons reshape the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond network, weakening proton transfer kinetics and further inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges still remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. Although high concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through the electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8208;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8208;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton, as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9&#8201;% for CO can be achieved at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2&#8201;% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photodetection by Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Indium&#8208;Halide with Minimal Structural Distortion and Reduced Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic challenges of 0D hybrid halides are addressed by tetragonal C24H72N8In2Br14, featuring closely spaced [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra linked by anion bridging and vacancies, facilitating a reduced direct band gap with enhanced carrier mobility, enabling visible light photodetection with responsivity of ~10&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, and ~81.2&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 with ~7&#215;109 Jones detectivity in self&#8208;powered mode.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;inspired zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid halides exhibit impressive light emission properties; however, their potential in photovoltaics is hindered by the absence of interconnection between the inorganic polyhedra, leading to acute radiative recombination and insufficient charge separation. We demonstrate that incorporating closely&#8208;spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible&#8208;light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C24H72N8In2Br14 (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs+ of Cs2InBr5.H2O (CIB) with 1,6&#8208;hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra, and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra units spaced 3.9&#8197;&#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr4]&#8722; unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite-inspired zero-dimensional (0D) hybrid halides exhibit impressive light emission properties; however, their potential in photovoltaics is hindered by the absence of interconnection between the inorganic polyhedra, leading to acute radiative recombination and insufficient charge separation. We demonstrate that incorporating closely-spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible-light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;InBr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (CIB) with 1,6-hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra, and [InBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra units spaced 3.9&#8197;&#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively. This structural arrangement lowers the dielectric confinement, thereby enhancing carrier density and mobility, and increasing the diffusion coefficient compared to CIB. With 3.6&#8201;% bromine vacancy within the [InBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; block, mid-gap states are created, reducing the direct band gap to 2.19&#8197;eV.

In the absence of potential bias, the self-powered photodetection parameters are 81.2&#177;3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and (6.98&#177;0.21)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Jones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine: Attractive scaffold for highly selective inhibitors of underexplored protein kinases with variable binding mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak interaction of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine with the kinase hinge region allows for design of highly selective inhibitors of underexplored kinases with variable binding modes. The newly identified chemical biology probe MU1920 targets the kinase Haspin with exquisite kinome&#8208;wide selectivity. Our observations suggest that the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used also for identification of inhibitors of other &#8220;non&#8208;routine&#8221; protein kinases, e.g. CDKLs.







Abstract
Protein kinases are key regulators of numerous biological processes and aberrant kinase activity can cause various diseases, particularly cancer. Herein, we report the identification of new series of highly selective kinase inhibitors based on the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold. The weak interaction of the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine core with the kinase hinge region allows for profoundly different binding modes all of which maintain high kinome&#8208;wide selectivity, as illustrated by the isomers MU1464 and MU1668. Thus, this core structure provides a template of ATP&#8208;competitive but not ATP&#8208;mimetic inhibitors that are anchored at the kinase back pocket. Mapping the chemical space around the central thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine pharmacophore afforded highly selective inhibitors of the kinase Haspin, exemplified by the compound MU1920 that fulfils criteria for a quality chemical probe and is suitable for use in in vivo applications. However, despite the role of Haspin in mitosis, the inhibition of Haspin alone was not sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. The thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used in a broader context, as a basis of inhibitors targeting other underexplored protein kinases, such as CDKLs.

         <title>Photomodulation of Charge Transfer through Excited&#8208;State Processes: Directing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Binding Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible binding of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs in solid state materials by light&#8208;manipulated charge transfer and electron transfer has been achieved, accompanied by visual color switching and fluorescence on&#8208;off as output signals.







Abstract
Modulating charge transfer (CT) interactions between donor and acceptor molecules may give rise to unique dynamic changes in physicochemical properties, exhibiting great importance in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, we demonstrate the first instance of reversible photomodulation of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) CT interaction in the solid state. Pyridinium&#8208;based chromophore featuring &#960;&#8208;conjugated D&#8722;A structures can not only function as a good electron acceptor to undergo photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or engage in intermolecular CT interaction, but also exhibit unique dual emission depending on the excitation wavelengths. The rotatable C&#8722;C single bonds within D&#8722;A pairs enhance the tunability of molecular structure. Through the synergy of a photoinduced ET and an excited&#8208;state conformational change, the intermolecular CT interaction can be switched on and off by alternate light irradiation to enable reversibly modulation of the affinity between donor and acceptor molecules, accompanied by visual color switching and fluorescence on&#8208;off as feedback signals.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Scale Hierarchical Organic Photocatalytic Platform for Self&#8208;Suspending Sacrificial Hydrogen Production from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary system at the molecular scale facilitates efficient charge transfer and enhanced photocatalytic activity. The super&#8208;wetted micro&#8208;nanoscale hierarchical interfaces of the platform enable it to repeatedly capture light and self&#8208;suspend below the water surface, simultaneously improving light utilization efficiency and reducing the adverse effects of salt deposition.







Abstract
The widespread application of photocatalysis for converting solar energy and seawater into hydrogen is generally hindered by limited catalyst activity and the lack of sustainable large&#8208;scale platforms. Here, a multi&#8208;scale hierarchical organic photocatalytic platform was developed, combining a photosensitive molecular heterojunction with a molecular&#8208;scale gradient energy level alignment and micro&#8208;nanoscale hierarchical pore structures. The ternary system facilitates efficient charge transfer and enhances photocatalytic activity compared to conventional donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Meanwhile, the super&#8208;wetted hierarchical interfaces of the platform endow it with the ability to repeatedly capture light and self&#8208;suspend below the water surface, which simultaneously improves the light utilization efficiency, and reduces the adverse effects of salt deposition. Under a Xe lamp illumination, the hydrogen evolution rate of this organic platform utilizing a sacrificial agent can reach 165.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, exceeding that of mostly inorganic systems as reported. And upon constructing a scalable system, the platform produced 80.6&#8197;ml&#8201;m&#8722;2 of hydrogen from seawater within five hours at noon. More importantly, the outcomes suggest an innovative multi&#8208;scale approach that bridges disciplines, advancing the frontier of sustainable seawater hydrogen production driven by solar energy.

         <title>A Highly Tumor&#8208;Permeating DNA Nanoplatform for Efficient Remodeling of Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanostructures have been widely employed as smart drug delivery systems. Now a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability has been constructed to precisely load chemo&#8208;immunomodulators and photosensitizers for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This structurally and chemically well&#8208;defined DNA nanoplaform enabled pronounced tumor therapy in vivo.







Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limited intratumoral permeation have largely constrained the outcome of tumor therapy. Herein, we report a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in vivo. In our design, chemo&#8208;immunomodulator (gemcitabine) can be precisely grafted on DNA sequences through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive linker.

&lt;p&gt;DNA nanostructures have been widely employed as smart drug delivery systems. Now a tailored DNA structure-based nanoplatform with striking tumor-penetrating capability has been constructed to precisely load chemo-immunomodulators and photosensitizers for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This structurally and chemically well-defined DNA nanoplaform enabled pronounced tumor therapy in vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limited intratumoral permeation have largely constrained the outcome of tumor therapy. Herein, we report a tailored DNA structure-based nanoplatform with striking tumor-penetrating capability for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in vivo. In our design, chemo-immunomodulator (gemcitabine) can be precisely grafted on DNA sequences through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive linker. After self-assembly, the gemcitabine-grafted DNA structure can site-specifically organize legumain-activatable melittin pro-peptide (promelittin) on each vertex for intratumoral delivery and further function as the template to load photosensitizers (methylene blue) for ROS production. The tailored DNA nanoplatform can achieve targeted accumulation, highly improved intratumoral permeation, and efficient immunogenic cell death of tumor cells by laser irradiation. Finally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can be successfully remodeled by reducing multi-type immunosuppressive cells and enhancing the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the tumor.

         <title>Modulating the Leverage Relationship in Nitrogen Fixation Through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom molecular catalyst with asymmetric O/N coordination forms hydrogen bonds with H2O to regulate proton transfer, simultaneously achieving superior NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency, and modulating the leverage relationship between activity and selectivity in nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
In the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), a leverage relationship exists between NH3&#8208;producing activity and selectivity because of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which means that high activity with strong protons adsorption causes low product selectivity. Herein, we design a novel metal&#8208;organic hydrogen bonding framework (MOHBF) material to modulate this leverage relationship by a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated proton transfer pathway. The MOHBF material was composited with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form a Ni&#8208;N2O2 molecular catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO). The unique structure of O atoms in Ni&#8208;O&#8208;C and N&#8208;O&#8208;H could form hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules to interfere with protons being directly adsorbed onto Ni active sites, thus regulating the proton transfer mechanism and slowing the HER kinetics, thereby modulating the leverage relationship. Moreover, this catalyst has abundant Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom sites enriched with Ni&#8208;N/O coordination, conducive to the adsorption and activation of N2. The Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO exhibits simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity of NH3 production with a maximum NH3 yield rate of 209.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%, outperforming other reported single&#8208;atom NRR catalysts.

         <title>Manufacturing Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for Selective CO2 Hydrogenation via Refinement of Isolated&#8208;Alloy&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; strategy for high metal loading single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) synthesis by refining alloyed nanoparticles is introduced here for CO2 hydrogenation, achieving 100% CO selectivity and over 55 times reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) rate than the alloys with Ru cluster sites. In addition, the SAA catalysts by the &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; strategy exhibited a 3&#8208;4 times higher RWGS rate than the SAA synthesized with the dilution method.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts exhibit huge potential in heterogeneous catalysis. Manufacturing SAAs requires complex and expensive synthesis methods to precisely control the atomic scale dispersion to form diluted alloys with less active sites and easy sintering of host metal, which is still in the early stages of development. Here, we address these limitations with a straightforward strategy from a brand&#8208;new perspective involving the &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; for manufacturing SAAs without dilution: homogeneous RuNi alloys were continuously refined to highly dispersed alloy&#8208;islands (~1&#8197;nm) with completely single&#8208;atom sites where the relative metal loading was as high as 40&#8201;%. Characterized by advanced atomic&#8208;resolution techniques, single Ru atoms were bonded with Ni as SAAs with extraordinary long&#8208;term stability and no sintering of the host metal. The SAAs exhibited 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, over 55 times reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) rate than the alloys with Ru cluster sites, and over 3&#8211;4 times higher than SAAs by the dilution strategy. This study reports a one&#8208;step manufacturing strategy for SAA's using the wetness impregnation method with durable high atomic efficiency and holds promise for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (MODOL) solvent is proposed by introducing electron&#8208;donated methoxy group onto 1,3&#8208;dioxolane to generate quasi&#8208;conjugate effect, weakening the coordinated ability of the solvent. Attributed to the anion&#8208;dominant solvation structure and inorganic&#8208;rich interface, the MODOL&#8208;based electrolyte has demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolytes are commonly employed in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) to attenuate the coordination ability of ether solvents with Li+ and induce inorganic&#8208;rich interphase, whereas fluorination inevitably introduces exorbitant production expenses and environmental anxieties. Herein, a non&#8208;fluorinated molecular design strategy has been conceptualized by incorporating methoxy as an electron&#8208;donating group to generate a quasi&#8208;conjugate effect for tuning the affinity of Li+&#8208;solvent, thereby enabling the cyclic ether solvent 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane with weak solvation ability and exceptional Li metal&#8208;compatibility. Accordingly, the optimized electrolyte exhibits anion&#8208;dominant solvation structure for inorganic&#8208;rich interphase and fulfills an impressive Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. As&#8208;fabricated Li||LiFePO4 full cells with limited Li (N/P=2.5) showcase a high capacity retention of 83&#8201;% after 150&#8197;cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the full LMBs demonstrate exceptional tolerance towards a wide temperature range from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C, displaying a remarkable capacity retention of 90&#8201;% after 110&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Such a molecular design strategy offers a promising avenue for electrolyte engineering beyond fluorination in order to cultivate high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Structure Enables Ultrahigh &#8216;Strong&#8208;Tough&#8217; Design of Phosphorus Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical cracking thickness of alloy&#8208;type anodes is typically suboptimal due to the inverse relationship between mass loading and intrinsic toughness. This issue is addressed by the development of a nacre&#8208;like structure, which contributes fast ionic/electronic migration and ultrahigh &#8216;strength&#8208;toughness&#8217;. Such structure design contributes to the enhancement of mass loading and long&#8208;life cycle stability of alloy&#8208;type anodes with high specific capacity.







Abstract
Red phosphorus anode, attributed to its high specific capacity of 2596&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, is expected to improve the energy density of Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the P anode currently is unsatisfactory for practical usage due to the large volume expansion beyond 300&#8201;%, which brings out uncontrolled brittle failure. To address this challenge, we here design a nacre&#8208;like phosphorus anode by resilient graphene oxide staggered together. The staggered structure simultaneously offers mechanical strength and interwoven toughness. Finite element modeling reveals that the sodiation stress from P nanoparticles will be transferred into interlayer pillars as the elastic medium to release sodiation stress. The prepared anode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a mass loading of 5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the volume change of the anode is limited to approximately 8.1&#8201;% at full sodiation, significantly lower than that of the traditional phosphorus electrodes.

     alt="Nacre-Inspired Structure Enables Ultrahigh &#8216;Strong-Tough&#8217; Design of Phosphorus Anode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical cracking thickness of alloy-type anodes is typically suboptimal due to the inverse relationship between mass loading and intrinsic toughness. This issue is addressed by the development of a nacre-like structure, which contributes fast ionic/electronic migration and ultrahigh &#8216;strength-toughness&#8217;. Such structure design contributes to the enhancement of mass loading and long-life cycle stability of alloy-type anodes with high specific capacity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red phosphorus anode, attributed to its high specific capacity of 2596&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is expected to improve the energy density of Na-ion batteries. However, the P anode currently is unsatisfactory for practical usage due to the large volume expansion beyond 300&#8201;%, which brings out uncontrolled brittle failure. To address this challenge, we here design a nacre-like phosphorus anode by resilient graphene oxide staggered together. The staggered structure simultaneously offers mechanical strength and interwoven toughness. Finite element modeling reveals that the sodiation stress from P nanoparticles will be transferred into interlayer pillars as the elastic medium to release sodiation stress. The prepared anode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a mass loading of 5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the volume change of the anode is limited to approximately 8.1&#8201;% at full sodiation, significantly lower than that of the traditional phosphorus electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Based on Linear and Trigonal Linkers for High&#8208;Performance H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks based on low&#8208;connectivity linear and trigonal linkers were constructed by the steric hindrance. The efficiency of the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide was markedly enhanced by regulating of the skeleton from two&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional configuration.







Abstract
The design of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) using linear and trigonal linkers remains challenging due to the difficulty in achieving a specific non&#8208;planar spatial arrangement with low&#8208;connectivity building units. Here, we report the novel 3D COFs with linear and trigonal linkers, termed TMB&#8208;COFs, exhibiting srs topology. The steric hindrance provides an additional force to alter the torsion angles of peripheral triangular units, guiding the linear unit to connect with the trigonal unit into 3D srs frameworks, rather than the more commonly observed two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hcb structures. Furthermore, we comprehensively examined the hydrogen peroxide photocatalytic production capacity of the TMB&#8208;COFs in comparison with analogous 2D COFs. The experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate a significant enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production efficacy through framework regulation. This work emphasizes the steric configuration using low connectivity building units, offering a fresh perspective on the design and application of 3D COFs.

         <title>Regulating Non&#8208;Equilibrium Solvation Structure in Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

We propose a concept of a non&#8208;equilibrium solvation structure, incorporating chloroalkane diluents into the solvation structure of Li+ ions to evaluate the impact of diluents on Li+ ion transportation and the oxidative stability of electrolyte under external electric field.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) encounters significant challenges due to aggressive electrode chemistry. Recently, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) have garnered attention for their exceptional stability with both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, there remains a limited understanding of how diluents in LCILEs affect the thermodynamic stability of the solvation structure and transportation dynamics of Li+ ions. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature LCILEs with 1,3&#8208;dichloropropane (DCP13) diluent to construct a non&#8208;equilibrium solvation structure under external electric field, wherein the DCP13 diluent enters the Li+ ion solvation sheath to enhance Li+ ion transport and suppress oxidative side reactions at high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, NCM90). Consequently, a Li/NCM90&#8197;cell utilizing this LCILE achieves a high capacity retention of 94&#8201;% after 240 cycles at 4.3&#8201;V, also operates stably at high cut&#8208;off voltages from 4.4&#8201;V to 4.6&#8201;V and over a wide temperature range from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with this LCILE simultaneously achieves high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and stable cycling, manifesting the practical feasibility. This work redefines the role of diluents in LCILEs, providing inspiration for electrolyte design in developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Molecular Iridium Catalyzed Electrochemical Formic Acid Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8722;N4&#8722;C) reveals key insights into the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) mechanism. In situ spectroscopy uncovers a direct dehydrogenation pathway, preventing catalyst poisoning. The study identifies pH and potential&#8208;sensitive steps, explaining observed kinetics. This research advances our understanding of complex oxidation reactions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation catalyst design.







Abstract
Electrochemical formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is a pivotal model for understanding organic fuel oxidation and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Here, we present mechanistic insights into a novel molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8722;N4&#8722;C) for FAOR. Our studies reveal that isolated sites facilitate a preferential dehydrogenation pathway, circumventing catalyst poisoning and exhibiting high inherent activity. In situ spectroscopic analyses elucidate that weakly adsorbed intermediates mediate the FAOR and are dynamically regulated by potential&#8208;dependent redox transitions. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate a parallel mechanism involving two key intermediates with distinct pH and potential sensitivities. The rate&#8208;determining step is identified as the adsorption of formate via coupled or sequential proton&#8208;electron transfer, which aligns well with the observed kinetic properties, pH dependence, and hydrogen/deuterium isotope effects in experiments. These findings provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism of FAOR, advancing our understanding at the molecular level and potentially guiding the design of efficient catalysts for fuel cells and electrolyzers.

         <title>Cleavage of Homonuclear Chalcogen&#8208;Chalcogen Bonds in a Hybrid Platform in Response to X&#8208;Ray Radiation Potentiates Tumor Radiochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;directed generation of chalcogens (S, Se, Te) in response to external ionizing radiation to enable drug decaging in target lesions remains a huge challenge. Hybrid monodisperse organosilicon nanoprodrugs containing homonuclear chalcogen&#8211;chalcogen single bonds have now been developed as a versatile X&#8208;ray&#8208;ultraresponsive nanoplatform for tumor radiochemotherapy.







Abstract
Chalcogens are used as sensitive redox&#8208;responsive reagents in tumor therapy. However, chalcogen bonds triggered by external ionizing radiation, rather than by internal environmental stimuli, enable site&#8208;directed and real&#8208;time drug degradation in target lesions. This approach helps to bypass chemoresistance and global systemic toxicity, presenting a significant advancement over traditional chemoradiotherapy. In this study, we fabricated a hybrid monodisperse organosilica nanoprodrug based on homonuclear single bonds (disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S, approximately 240&#8197;kJ/mol), diselenium bonds (Se&#8722;Se, approximately 172&#8197;kJ/mol), and tellurium bonds (Te&#8722;Te, 126&#8197;kJ/mol)), including ditelluride&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DTeMSNs), diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSeMSNs) and disulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSMSNs). The results demonstrated that differences in electronegativities and atomic radii influenced their oxidation sensitivities and reactivities. Tellurium, with the lowest electronegativity, showed the highest sensitivity, followed by selenium and sulfur. DTeMSNs exhibited highly responsive cleavage upon exposure to X&#8208;rays, resulting in oxidation to TeO32&#8722;. Furthermore, chalcogen&#8208;hybridized organosilica was loaded with manganese ions (Mn2+) to enhance the release of Mn2+ during radiotherapy, thereby activating the the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and enhancing the tumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation of hybrid organosilica deepens our understanding of chalcogens response characteristics to radiotherapy and enriches the design principles for nanomedicine based on prodrugs.

DTeMSNs exhibited highly responsive cleavage upon exposure to X-rays, resulting in oxidation to TeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, chalcogen-hybridized organosilica was loaded with manganese ions (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) to enhance the release of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during radiotherapy, thereby activating the the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and enhancing the tumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation of hybrid organosilica deepens our understanding of chalcogens response characteristics to radiotherapy and enriches the design principles for nanomedicine based on prodrugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane towards Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, achieved by engineering the current collectors with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic layers that possess high permanent quadrupole moment, can fundamentally regulate the inner Helmholtz plane structure and lithium (Li)&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to construct stable anion&#8208;derived inorganic solid electrolyte interphase layer, thus achieving unprecedented Li plating/stripping performance and long lifespan for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with thick cathodes.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries (AFLBs) featured high energy density are viewed as the viable future energy storage technology. However, the irregular Li deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode current collectors reduce their cycling performance. Here, we propose a concept of anion&#8208;recognition electrodes enabled by anion&#8208;&#960; interactions to regulate the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and electrolyte solvation chemistry for high&#8208;performance AFLBs. By engineering the electrodes with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic&#8208;&#960; systems that possess high permanent quadrupole moment (Qzz), the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions can be generated to concentrate the anions on the electrode surface and tune the IHP structure to construct a stable anion&#8208;derived SEI layer, thus achieving highly reversible Li plating/stripping process. Through designing various current collectors with different Qzz values, the intimate correlations among the surface charge of the electrode, competitive adsorption of the IHP, and SEI structures are demonstrated. Particularly, the modified carbon cloth current collector with a high Qzz value (+35.1) delivers a high average Li stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;% over 230 cycles in the carbonated electrolyte, enabling a long lifespan and high capacity retention of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based AFLBs with a commercial&#8208;level areal capacity (4.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Solution Versus On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Peripherally Oxygen&#8208;Annulated Porphyrins through C&#8722;O Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;O&#8208;fused porphyrinoids via an oxidative O&#8208;annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. By synthesizing on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, challenges like overoxidation and instability were addressed. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy show the formation of pyran moieties through C&#8722;O bond formation and self&#8208;assembly via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, which reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap through HOMO rising as more O&#8208;atoms are added.







Abstract
This study investigates the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;O&#8208;fused porphyrinoids employing an oxidative O&#8208;annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. Despite encountering challenges such as overoxidation and instability in conventional solution protocols, successful synthesis was achieved on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy elucidated the preferential formation of pyran moieties via C&#8722;O bond formation and subsequent self&#8208;assembly driven by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Furthermore, the O&#8208;annulation process was found to reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by lifting the HOMO energy level, with the effect rising upon increasing the number of embedded O&#8208;atoms.

         <title>A Modular Approach for Accessing 3D Heterocycles via 1,2&#8208;Dicyanation of Planar N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative functionalization approach of abundant N&#8208;heteroarenes has been developed to harvest valued 3D N&#8208;heterocyclic skeletons. This robust method is enabled by the in situ generation of highly reactive non&#8208;symmetric iodane from bench&#8208;stable hypervalent iodane, PhI(OAc)2, and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 A wide range of N&#8208;heteroarenes were transformed into their corresponding 3D analog via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector.







Abstract
The rapid construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic frameworks is a key challenge in contemporary medicinal chemistry. The molecules with three&#8208;dimensional complexity hold a greater probability to improve clinical outcomes, solubility, selectivity for target proteins, and metabolic stability. However, the prevalence of flat molecules persists among new drug candidates, primarily owing to the multitude of chemical methods available for their synthesis. In principle, the dearomative functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene allows for the conversion of readily available planar molecules into partially or fully saturated nitrogen heterocycles, which are most significant structural motifs of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Unfortunately, these reactions are very rare because of the inherent challenge imposed by heteroarenes&#8217; poor reactivity, rendering the process thermodynamically unfavorable. Herein, we report a modular approach for accessing 3D chemical space in translating planar heteroarenes into valuable 3D heterocycles via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector. This approach is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive, non&#8208;symmetric iodane by combining cyanide anion and bench&#8208;stable PhI(OAc)2. This reaction represents a rare example of 1,2&#8208;dicyanation of N&#8208;heteroarenes that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug and agrochemical discovery. The transformation is highly selective and amenable to a wide range of N&#8208;heteroarenes and late&#8208;stage partial saturation of drugs and agrochemicals.

         <title>Rational Design of 7&#8208;Azaindole&#8208;Based Robust Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Gas Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A preorganized tetrapodal building block, incorporating &#945;&#8208;carboline units, self&#8208;assembles to form a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). The expanded hydrogen bonding between the heteroaromatic substructures, along with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, spontaneously build up an interpenetrated architecture that bestows an extraordinary robustness to the microporous crystalline material, showing a good selectivity for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
7&#8208;Azaindole has been integrated as building block with complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding sites for the synthesis of a tetrahedral molecular tecton, namely tetra(&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)methane, TACM. The self&#8208;assembly of this molecule results in a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). This supramolecular structure constitutes a crystalline microporous material with an extraordinary thermal and chemical robustness. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals how the five&#8208;fold catenation of diamonoid systems, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, form an interpenetrated network with monodimensional channels. The structural features of the crystalline material are also observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, the microporosity of the activated TACM&#8208;HOF is characterized by gas sorption (N2, CO2, CH4 and H2) experiments performed at different pressures. A selective adsorption is observed for CO2 uptake and TACM&#8208;HOF also presents a good adsorption capacity for H2 among supramolecular organic frameworks.

A selective adsorption is observed for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake and TACM-HOF also presents a good adsorption capacity for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; among supramolecular organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revitalizing Dead Zinc with Ferrocene/Ferrocenium Redox Chemistry for Deep&#8208;Cycle Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dissolve oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy is proposed to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which differs from the widely concerned dendrite suppression strategies. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen and the generated ferricenium cations can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries are highly desirable for sustainable and large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the ceaseless dendrite growth and the derived dead Zn are principally responsible for the capacity decay and insufficient lifespan. Here, we propose a dissolved oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which can be realized by incorporating a trace amount of poly(ethylene glycol) as a solubilizer to improve the solubility of water&#8208;insoluble ferrocene derivatives. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen, which eradicates the dissolved oxygen&#8208;involved Zn corrosion and insulating by&#8208;product generation. Subsequently, the generated ferricenium cations as the scavenger can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss. Through this design, the symmetric cell exhibited improved cycle life of 3700&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 220&#8197;h under a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. Importantly, the Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cells demonstrated the impressive cycling stability over 1500&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 3.0. This work presents an innovative solution for the revitalization of dead Zn to extend the lifespan of deep&#8208;cycling metal batteries.

         <title>Arenicolide Family Macrolides Provide a New Therapeutic Lead Combating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical and genomic studies of the arenicolide family macrolides discovered eight new congeners, assigned the previously undetermined absolute configuration, and identified their type&#8197;I polyketide biosynthetic pathway. Biological evaluation revealed that arenicolide A inhibits drug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as an effective bactericidal agent by depleting ATP and disrupting Mtb cell wall, thus providing a new therapeutic lead.







Abstract
The emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) and extensively drug&#8208;resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses a significant threat to health globally. During searching for new chemical entities regulating MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb, chemical investigation of the black oil beetle gut bacterium Micromonospora sp. GR10 led to the discovery of eight new members of arenicolides along with the identification of arenicolide A (Ar&#8722;A, 1), which was a previously reported macrolide with incomplete configuration. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain GR10 revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway. Quantum mechanics&#8208;based computation, chemical derivatizations, and bioinformatic analysis established the absolute stereochemistry of Ar&#8722;A and arenicolides D&#8722;K (Ar&#8722;D&#8722;K, 2&#8211;9) completely for the first time. Biological studies of 1&#8211;9 revealed their antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR strains of Mtb. Ar&#8722;A had the most potent in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb. Mechanistically, Ar&#8722;A induced ATP depletion and destabilized Mtb cell wall, thereby inhibiting growth. Notably, Ar&#8722;A exerted a significant antimicrobial effect against Mtb in macrophages, was effective in the treatment of Mtb infections, and showed a synergistic effect with amikacin (AMK) in a mouse model of MDR&#8208;Mtb lung infection. Collectively, our findings indicate Ar&#8722;A to be a promising drug lead for drug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis.

         <title>Highly Selective Synthesis of Acetic Acid from Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Methane at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route for methane oxidation to acetic acid with high selectivity using O2 and CO over Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. A high acetic acid selectivity of 92&#8201;% was achieved at the yield of 5.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 3.0&#8197;h. Au nanoparticles catalyzed hydroxyl species formation from CO, O2, and H2O, while atomically dispersed Fe species promoted the C&#8722;C coupling of CH4 and CO to produce acetic acid.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion and, in particular, the aerobic oxidation to acetic acid, remain an eminent challenge. Here, we reported a zeolite&#8208;supported Au&#8722;Fe catalyst (Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5) that converted methane to acetic acid with molecular oxygen as an oxidant in the presence of CO. Specifically, Au nanoparticles catalyzed the formation of hydroxyl species from the reaction of CO, O2, and H2O, meanwhile ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;supported atomically dispersed Fe species were responsible for the hydroxyl&#8208;mediated coupling of CH4 and CO to generate acetic acid. The reaction over 50&#8197;mg of Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 under 62&#8197;bar (CH4&#8201;:&#8201;CO&#8201;:&#8201;O2=14&#8201;:&#8201;14&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 3.0&#8197;h yielded 5.7 millimoles of acetic acid per gram of the catalyst (mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) with the selectivity of 92&#8201;%, outperformed most of reported catalysts. Significantly, the catalyst remained active even at 60&#8201;&#176;C. We anticipate that this hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route may guide the design of optimized catalysts for the direct methane functionalization at low temperatures.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Azobenzene Photoswitch for DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Regulation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We highlight the use of a molecular photoswitch capable of quantitative isomerization triggered by visible light. This approach enables the photoregulation of G&#8208;quadruplex structures (G4s) within live cells. The interaction mode of the photoswitch with the G4 template&#8212;from external binding to intercalation&#8212;can be dynamically adjusted through light exposure, facilitating the controlled regulation of the G4 state.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are increasingly acknowledged as promising targets in cancer research, and the development of G4&#8208;specific stabilizing compounds may lay a fundamental foundation in precision medicine for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binder for precise modulation of drug activation, providing dynamic and spatiotemporal control over G4&#8208;associated biological processes contributing to cancer cell death. We developed a specialized fluorinated azobenzene (AB) switch equipped with a quinoline unit and a positively charged carboxamide side chain, Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C, designed for targeted binding to G4 structures within cells. Biophysical studies, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, provide insights into the unique coordination modes of the photoswitchable ligand in its trans and cis configurations when interacting with G4s. The observed variations in complexation processes between the two isomeric states in different cancer cell lines manifest in more than 25&#8208;fold reversible cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining conducted with the structure&#8208;specific G4 antibody (BG4), establishes a direct correlation between cytotoxicity and the varying extent of G4 induction regulated by the two isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the photo&#8208;driven reversible regulation of G4 structures in lung cancer cells by Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binders in advancing precision cancer therapy through dynamic control of G4&#8208;mediated pathways.

     alt="A Rationally Designed Azobenzene Photoswitch for DNA G-Quadruplex Regulation in Live Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlight the use of a molecular photoswitch capable of quantitative isomerization triggered by visible light. This approach enables the photoregulation of G-quadruplex structures (G4s) within live cells. The interaction mode of the photoswitch with the G4 template&#8212;from external binding to intercalation&#8212;can be dynamically adjusted through light exposure, facilitating the controlled regulation of the G4 state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are increasingly acknowledged as promising targets in cancer research, and the development of G4-specific stabilizing compounds may lay a fundamental foundation in precision medicine for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a light-responsive G4-binder for precise modulation of drug activation, providing dynamic and spatiotemporal control over G4-associated biological processes contributing to cancer cell death. We developed a specialized fluorinated azobenzene (AB) switch equipped with a quinoline unit and a positively charged carboxamide side chain, &lt;b&gt;Q-Azo4F-C&lt;/b&gt;, designed for targeted binding to G4 structures within cells. Biophysical studies, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, provide insights into the unique coordination modes of the photoswitchable ligand in its &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configurations when interacting with G4s. The observed variations in complexation processes between the two isomeric states in different cancer cell lines manifest in more than 25-fold reversible cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining conducted with the structure-specific G4 antibody (BG4), establishes a direct correlation between cytotoxicity and the varying extent of G4 induction regulated by the two isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the photo-driven reversible regulation of G4 structures in lung cancer cells by &lt;b&gt;Q-Azo4F-C&lt;/b&gt;. Our findings highlight the potential of light-responsive G4-binders in advancing precision cancer therapy through dynamic control of G4-mediated pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction Pathways between Ethylene and Ethanol via Tuning Microenvironment of the Coating on Copper Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic surface facilitates CO2 diffusion and weakens the hydrogen bonding interactions between interfacial H2O, ensuring a high ratio of CO2 to H2O. This directs the reaction pathway from ethylene towards ethanol in CO2RR.







Abstract
Engineering the microenvironment of electrode surface is one of the effective means to tune the reaction pathways in CO2RR. In this work, we prepared copper nanofibers with conductive polypyrrole coating by polymerization of pyrrole using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as template. As a result, the obtained copper nanofibers Cu/Cu2+1O/SHNC, exhibited a superhydrophobic surface, which demonstrated very high selectivity for ethanol with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 66.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in flow cell. However, the catalyst Cu/Cu2+1O/NC, which was prepared under the same conditions but without PVP, possessed a hydrophobic surface and exhibited high selectivity towards ethylene at the given potentials. The mechanism for switch of reaction pathways from ethylene to ethanol in CO2RR was studied. Incorporating pyrrolidone groups into the polymer coating results in the formation of a superhydrophobic surface. This surface weakens the hydrogen bonding interaction between interfacial water molecules and facilitates the transfer of CO2, thereby enhancing the local CO2/H2O ratio. The high coverage of *CO promotes the coupling of *CO and *CHO to form C2 intermediates, and reduces the reaction energy for the formation of *CHCHOH (ethanol path) at the interface. This ensures that the reaction pathway is directed towards ethanol.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Induces Halogen/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (XAT/HAT) for Allylic C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective allylic C&#8722;H amination has been established via lead halide perovskite nanocrystals as the photocatalyst. The CsPbBr3 catalyst exhibits remarkable halogen vacancies that exploit halogenated solvents as mild oxidants for C&#8722;H amination. A cooperative halogen/hydrogen atom transfer reaction mechanism has been interrogated and concludes the observed high selectivity and broad scope of such allylic C&#8722;H functionalization products, ranging from natural products to drug derivatives.







Abstract
Allylic C&#8722;H amination has emerged as a powerful tool to construct allylamines, common motifs in molecular therapeutics. Such reaction implies an oxidative path for C&#8722;H activation but furnishes reductive amines, inferring mild oxidants&#8217; inactivity for C&#8722;H oxidation but strong oxidants&#8217; detriment to products. Herein we report a heterogeneous catalytic approach that manipulates halogen&#8208;vacancies of perovskite photocatalyst and exploits halogenated&#8208;solvents (i.e. CH2Cl2, CH2Br2) as mild oxidants for selective C&#8722;H allyl amination with 19,376&#8197;turnovers. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals induce cooperative hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT, C&#8722;H oxidation, and halogen&#8208;vacancy CsPbBr3&#8722;x formation) and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (XAT, CsPbBr3&#8722;x&#8208;induced solvent reduction) under a radical chain mechanism. Terminal/internal olefins are amenable to forge aromatic/aliphatic, cyclic/acyclic, secondary/tertiary allylamines (70&#8197;examples), including drugs or their derivatives.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Gas Three&#8208;Phase Indirect Electrolysis Enabled by Affinity Auxiliary Imparted Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
A solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system has been developed based on a covalent organic framework (Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu) as heterogeneous redox mediator for S&#8722;S coupling reaction.







Abstract
The design of efficient heterogeneous redox mediators with favorable affinity to substrate and electrolyte are much desired yet still challenging for the development of indirect electrolysis system. Herein, for the first time, we have developed a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system based on a covalent organic framework (Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu) as heterogeneous redox mediator for S&#8722;S coupling reaction. Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu with the integration of high porosity, nanorod morphology, abundant hydroxyl groups and active Cu sites is much beneficial for the adsorption/activation of thiols, uniform dispersion and high wettability in electrolyte, and efficient interfacial electron transfer. Notably, Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu as solid&#8208;phase redox mediator exhibits excellent electrocatalytic efficiency for the formation of value&#8208;added liquid&#8208;phase S&#8722;S bond product (yields up to 99&#8201;%) coupling with the generation of gas&#8208;phase product of H2 (~1.40&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), resulting in a powerful three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system. This is the first work about COFs that can be applied in three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system, which might promote the development of porous crystalline materials in this field.

         <title>Coordination Induced Spin State Transition Switches the Reactivity of Nickel (II) Porphyrin in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores the impact of coordination&#8208;induced spin&#8208;state switching on hydrogen evolution reaction activity of nickel(II) porphyrin, revealing that low&#8208;spin Ni(II) porphyrin favors hydrogen evolution while high&#8208;spin counterpart facilitates &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin periphery. Our finding highlights the pivotal role of spin transition in regulating the reactivity and selectivity of metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state&#8208;to&#8208;state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni (II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton&#8208;coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin&#8208;dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand's electron density after one&#8208;electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &#946;&#8208;periphery rather than meso&#8208;position or metal center.

When pyridine is present, we observed &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton-coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin-dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; by CoCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with subsequent addition of pyridinium &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand's electron density after one-electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-periphery rather than &lt;i&gt;mes&lt;/i&gt;o-position or metal center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Polymer Membrane with High Stability and Enhanced Ion&#8208;Sieving Effect for Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in situ polymerization based on nucleophilic substitution, the self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer membrane (TAPT&#8208;CC) was successfully prepared. This membrane exhibits a persistent ultramicropores structure and exceptional chemical stability, facilitating efficient ion sieving and rapid proton transport. The all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batterie (VFB) with self&#8208;standing TAPT&#8208;CC membrane exhibits remarkable efficiency and durability.







Abstract
Fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting membranes with continuous sub&#8208;nanometer channels holds fundamental importance for flow batteries in achieving safe integration of renewable energy into grids. Self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer (COP) membranes provide feasibility due to their rapid and selective ion transport. However, the development of a scale&#8208;up possible, mechanically robust and chemically stable membranes remains a significant challenge. Herein, using irreversible strong secondary amine linkage, we propose a self&#8208;standing COP membrane with sub&#8208;nanometer pores ranging from 4.5 to 6.4&#8197;&#197;, by a simple and efficient in situ polymerization approach. This membrane exhibits enhanced selectivity for proton and vanadium ions, especially excellent electrochemical stability, delivering an energy efficiency of over 80&#8201;% at the current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;cycles for an all&#8208;vanadium redox flow battery (VFB). This study provides novel insights for COP&#8208;based ion&#8208;sieving membranes in sustainable energy fields.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Chiral Overcrowded Alkene Twisting Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) based on an enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone. FcD exhibits thermal/photochemical E/Z isomerization and is redox&#8208;switchable, which significantly alters its chiral expression and optical properties. As a chiral dopant in cholesteric liquid crystals, FcD enables redox&#8208;tuning of the liquid crystal reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm, showcasing its potential in functional materials.







Abstract
The reversible modulation of chirality has gained significant attention not only for fundamental stereochemical studies but also for numerous applications ranging from liquid crystals (LCs) to molecular motors and machines. This requires the construction of switchable molecules with (multiple) chiral elements in a highly enantioselective manner, which is often a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we show that the dimerization of an easily accessible enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone building block affords a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) with pre&#8208;determined double bond geometry, helical chirality, and relative orientation of the two ferrocene motifs in high yield. This intrinsically planar chiral switch can not only undergo thermal or photochemical E/Z isomerization but can also be reversibly and quantitatively oxidized to both a monocationic and a dicationic state which is associated with significant changes in its (chir)optical properties. Specifically, FcD acts as a chiral dopant for cholesteric LCs with a helical twisting power (HTP) of 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8722;1 which, upon oxidation, drops to near zero, resulting in an unprecedently large redox&#8208;tuning of the LC reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm. Due to the straightforward stereoselective synthesis, FcD, and related chiral switches, are envisioned to be powerful building blocks for multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular machines and in LC&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Thermoelectric Performance in Triplet&#8208;Ground&#8208;State Polymer Intrinsically Boosted by Enhanced Proquinoidal Characteristic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the simultaneous incorporation of strong proquinoidal donor and acceptor units, copolymer PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits a highly stable triplet ground state, an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap, and strong spin interactions between the polymer chain terminals. These unique properties enable PBBT&#8208;TT to achieve a high power factor of up to 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 with extraordinary ambient stability, which is currently the best performed doping&#8208;free organic thermoelectric material.







Abstract
Over the past decade, polymer thermoelectric materials featuring flexibility, lightness, and bio&#8208;friendliness have been paid increasing attention as promising candidates for waste heat recovery and energy generation. For a long time, the dominant approach to optimizing the thermoelectric performance of most organic materials is chemical doping, which, however, is not always ideal for practical applications due to its tendency to involve intricate processing procedure and trigger material and device instability. Currently, the pursuit of single&#8208;component neutral thermoelectric materials without exogenous doping presents a compelling alternative. In this work, we designed and synthesized a high&#8208;spin polymer material, PBBT&#8208;TT, by simultaneously employing thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene (TbT) and benzo[1,2&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT) units with pronounced proquinoidal characteristics, its analogue, PBBT&#8208;T to demonstrate the effect of the TbT unit was also synthesized. The results indicate that because of the enhanced quinoidal resonance, increased spin density and strong intermolecular antiferromagnetic coupling, PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits high intrinsic electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which showcases an outstanding power factor of 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 without doping. This achievement surpasses other neutral organic conjugated polymer and radical conductors, and is even comparable to some typical early&#8208;stage doped polymers. Notably, PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits remarkable ambient stability, retaining its initial thermoelectric performance over a 120&#8208;day period. Our finding demonstrates that modulating the intermolecular spin interactions in open&#8208;shell polymers through the introduction of strong proquinoidal units is an effective strategy for the development of doping&#8208;free, intrinsically high&#8208;performance polymer thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Li2ZnCu3 Modified Cu Current Collector to Regulate Li Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the good lithiophilicity, low work function, Li+ ion concentration regulation, and strong anion interaction, of Li2ZnCu3 alloy, the surface modified&#8208;Cu can endow homogeneous initial Li deposition, thereby achieving a low&#8208;porosity and smooth Li deposition even at an ultrahigh Li loading of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as the high energy density of the 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 when coupled with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity cathode.







Abstract
Rationally designing a current collector that can maintain low lithium (Li) porosity and smooth morphology while enduring high&#8208;loading Li deposition is crucial for realizing the high energy density of Li metal batteries, but it is still challengeable. Herein, a Li2ZnCu3 alloy&#8208;modified Cu foil is reported as a stable current collector to fulfill the stable high&#8208;loading Li deposition. Benefiting from the in situ alloying, the generated numerous Li2ZnCu3@Cu heterojunctions induce a homogeneous Li nucleation and dense growth even at an ultrahigh capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Such a spatial structure endows the overall Li2ZnCu3@Cu electrode with the manipulated steric hindrance and outmost surface electric potential to suppress the side reactions during Li stripping and plating. The resultant Li||Li2ZnCu3@Cu asymmetric cell preserves an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 200 cycles. Moreover, the Li&#8208;Li2ZnCu3@Cu||LiFePO4 cell maintains a cycling stability of 87.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. After coupling with the LiCoO2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), the cell exhibits a high energy density of 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with remarkable cycling reversibility at an N/P ratio of 3. All these findings present a doable way to realize the high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free, and dense Li deposition for high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Rationally designing a current collector that can maintain low lithium (Li) porosity and smooth morphology while enduring high-loading Li deposition is crucial for realizing the high energy density of Li metal batteries, but it is still challengeable. Herein, a Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloy-modified Cu foil is reported as a stable current collector to fulfill the stable high-loading Li deposition. Benefiting from the in situ alloying, the generated numerous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu heterojunctions induce a homogeneous Li nucleation and dense growth even at an ultrahigh capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Such a spatial structure endows the overall Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu electrode with the manipulated steric hindrance and outmost surface electric potential to suppress the side reactions during Li stripping and plating. The resultant Li||Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu asymmetric cell preserves an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 200 cycles. Moreover, the Li-Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cell maintains a cycling stability of 87.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. After coupling with the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the cell exhibits a high energy density of 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with remarkable cycling reversibility at an N/P ratio of 3. All these findings present a doable way to realize the high-capacity, dendrite-free, and dense Li deposition for high-performance Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Multifunctional Organic Molecules via Michael Addition Reaction to Manage Perovskite Crystallization and Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a multifunctional organic small molecule additive in a targeted manner, successfully controlling the crystallization and defects in perovskite films, effectively releasing the residual strain in the perovskite film and reducing the hysteresis phenomenon. The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs exceeds 25.7&#8201;% based on this strategy.







Abstract
Additive engineering plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;quality light&#8208;absorbing layers for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Various functional groups within the additives exert distinct regulatory effects on the perovskite layer. However, few additive molecules can synergistically fulfill the dual functions of regulating crystallization and passivating defects. Here, we custom&#8208;synthesized 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) organic small molecules with diverse functional groups as additives to modulate crystallization and defects in perovskite films via the Michael addition reaction. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the &#8722;OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead&#8208;iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the enhanced C=O and &#8722;NH2 motifs interact with the A&#8208;site cation via hydrogen bonding, which relieves residual strain and adjusts crystal orientation. This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the UPy&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs reaches 1.20&#8197;V, and the fill factor surpasses 84&#8201;%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75&#8201;%. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device maintained 96.9&#8201;% and 94.5&#8201;% of its initial efficiency following 3,360&#8197;hours of dark storage and 1,866&#8197;hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleation Regulation Amends Unfavorable Crystallization Orientation and Defect Features of Antimony Selenosulfide Film for High&#8208;Efficient Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

In this study, we utilize BaBr2 to innovatively regulate the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film synthesized via hydrothermal deposition approach. This strategy optimizes the crystalline orientation and defect features, suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Thus, the champion device presents a PCE of 10.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) has obtained widespread concern for photovoltaic applications as a light absorber due to superior photoelectric features. Accordingly, various deposition technologies have been developed in recent years, especially hydrothermal deposition method, which has achieved a great success. However, device performances are limited with severe carrier recombination, relating to the quality of absorber and interfaces. Herein, bulk and interface defects are simultaneously suppressed by regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics with barium dibromide (BaBr2) introduction. In details, the Br adsorbs and dopes on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, promoting the exposure of nonpolar planes of CdS, which facilitates the favorable growth of [hk1]&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 films possessing superior crystallinity and small interface defects. Additionally, the Se/S ratio is increased due to the replacement of Se by Br, causing a downshift of the Fermi levels with a benign band alignment and a shallow&#8208;level defect. Moreover, Ba2+ is located at grain boundaries by coordination with S and Se ions, passivating grain boundary defects. Consequently, the efficiency is increased from 7.70&#8201;% to 10.12&#8201;%. This work opens an avenue towards regulating the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film deposited via hydrothermal deposition approach to optimize its crystalline orientation and defect features.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Insertion Strategy for Constructing 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Large Pore Size for Electrochemical Analytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous 2D conjugated MOF was synthesized through a novel ligand insertion strategy. By inserting a linear ligand, 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone, into the metal node of Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP=hexahydrotriphenylene), the pore size of the MOF was expanded from 1.8 to 3.2&#8197;nm. The increased pore size in this MOF facilitates the diffusion of redox species, thereby improving the sensitivity for electrochemical detection of various analytes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have shown great promise in various electrochemical applications due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity. A large pore aperture is a favorable feature of this type of material because it facilitates the mass transport of chemical species and electrolytes. In this work, we propose a ligand insertion strategy in which a linear ligand is inserted into the linkage between multitopic ligands, extending the metal ion into a linear unit of &#8208;M&#8208;ligand&#8208;M&#8208;, for the construction of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with large pore apertures, utilizing only small ligands. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial of this strategy, a 2D c&#8208;MOF with mesopores of 3.2&#8197;nm was synthesized using commercially available ligands hexahydrotriphenylene and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone. The facilitation of the diffusion of redox species by the large pore size of this MOF was demonstrated through a series of probes. With this feature, it showed superior performance in the electrochemical analysis of a variety of biological species.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;labeling protein tag in combination with exchangeable fluorophore ligands bypasses photobleaching and enables long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule imaging in living cells. This extends observation times in single cells and enables direct monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor activation in living cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual living cells of up to 30&#8197;minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor mobility, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of an ER&#8208;luminal protein in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein mobility in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.

Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy-to-apply labeling approach for live-cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual living cells of up to 30&#8197;minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand-induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non-uniform distributions of receptor mobility, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of an ER-luminal protein in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano-structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein mobility in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nebulized Immunotherapy of Orthotopic Lung Cancer by Mild Magnetothermal&#8211;Based Innate Immunity Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel nebulized magnetothermal immunotherapy strategy to treat orthotopic lung cancer by using magnetothermal nanomaterial (Zn&#8722;CoFe2O4@Zn&#8722;MnFe2O4&#8722;PEG, named ZCMP), which is capable of releasing iron ions via acid/thermal reaction to maximize the use of lung&#8216;s immune environment through cascade activations of AMs and NK cells. The novel strategy shows excellent therapeutic results against orthotopic lung cancer.







Abstract
Advances in adaptive immunity have greatly contributed to the development of cancer immunotherapy. However, its over&#8208;low efficacy and insufficient invasion of immune cells in the tumor tissue, and safety problems caused by cytokine storm, have seriously impeded further clinical application for solid tumor immunotherapy. Notably, the immune microenvironment of the lungs is naturally enriched with alveolar macrophages (AMs). Herein, we introduce a novel nebulized magnetothermal immunotherapy strategy to treat orthotopic lung cancer by using magnetothermal nanomaterial (Zn&#8722;CoFe2O4@Zn&#8722;MnFe2O4&#8722;PEG, named ZCMP), which can release iron ions via an acid/thermal&#8208;catalytic reaction to maximize the use of lung&#8216;s immune environment through the cascade activations of AMs and natural killer (NK) cells. Nebulized administration greatly enhance drug bioavailability by localized drug accumulation at the lesion site. Upon mild magnetic hyperthermia, the released iron ions catalyze endogenous H2O2 decomposition to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers the M1 polarization of AMs, and the resultant inflammatory cytokine IFN&#8208;&#946;, IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;15 releases to activate c&#8208;Jun, STAT5 and GZMB related signaling pathways, promoting NK cells proliferation and activation. This innovative strategy optimally utilizes the lung&#8216;s immune environment and shows excellent immunotherapeutic outcomes against orthotopic lung cancer.

         <title>Polyethylene Recycling via Water Activation by Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene degraded through an unreported reaction pathway, with water activation involved, resulting in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols and ketones (Cn, n&#8818;50). The reaction was driven by ball milling, avoiding high temperature and pressurization. No noble&#8208;metal or complex catalysts were used. Only earth&#8208;abundant Al2O3 was milled with reactants.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most prevalent type of plastic waste and also the most challenging to depolymerize because of its inert carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds.[1] High temperature and noble metals are usually required for depolymerization.[2] To avoid using noble metals, costly reagents and harsh reaction conditions, it is worthwhile but challenging to explore new reaction pathways.[3] We report an unprecedented mechanochemical reaction of PE and water to result in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and ketones (Cn, where n&#8818;50), with above 80&#8201;% of starting carbon converted into these products, which could be a valuable feedstock for re&#8208;entering chemical value chains. This reaction is driven solely by ball milling, without heating and pressurizing. No costly catalysts are used. Instead, only earth&#8208;abundant Al2O3 was milled with reactants.

         <title>The Swiss Army Knife of Electrodes: Pillar[6]arene&#8208;Modified Electrodes for Molecular Electrocatalysis Over a Wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[6]arene&#8208;functionalised indium tin oxide electrodes can be modified with electrocatalytically active ruthenium complexes through host&#8211;guest interactions. These versatile electrodes exhibit activity for reactions across a broad pH range (2.4&#8211;10.8) and can be reused after reabsorption of the desorbed catalyst. Different electrocatalytic transformations can be conducted under varying conditions utilising the same electrode.







Abstract
Molecularly&#8208;modified electrode materials that maintain stability over a broad pH range are rare. Typically, each electrochemical transformation necessitates a specifically tuned system to achieve strong binding and high activity of the catalyst. Here, we report the functionalisation of mesoporous indium tin oxide (mITO) electrodes with the macrocyclic host molecule pillar[6]arene (PA[6]). These electrodes are stable within the pH range of 2.4&#8211;10.8 and can be equipped with electrochemically active ruthenium complexes through host&#8211;guest interactions to perform various oxidation reactions. Benzyl alcohol oxidation serves as a model reaction in acidic media, while ammonia oxidation is conducted to assess the systems performance under basic conditions. PA[6]&#8208;modified electrodes demonstrate catalytic activity for both reactions when complexed to different guest molecules and can be reused by reabsorption of the catalyst after its degradation. Furthermore, the system can be employed to perform subsequent reactions in electrolyte with varying pH, enabling the same electrode to be utilised in multiple different electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Highly Luminescent Cu(I) Metallacycles toward New Luminescent Thermic Tracers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TADF luminescent Cu(I) metallacycle B carrying unusual semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands has been prepared in a one&#8208;step high&#8208;yield reaction. When B is heated markedly above room temperature, a solid&#8208;state reaction affords a new metallacycle C displaying TADF luminescence different from that of B. The removal of the aqua ligands and the formation of cuprophilic interactions makes this transition an innovative example of a solid&#8208;state photoactive tracer.







Abstract
A new luminescent Cu(I) tetrametallic metallacycle B is reported that features very rare semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands. When heated markedly above room temperature, this compound undergoes a post&#8208;synthetic transformation in the solid&#8208;state, affording the new luminescent metallacycle C. Thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that this alteration preserves the gross tetrametallic macrocycle structure, but is caused by the release of the coordinated water molecules with the concomitant formation of cuprophilic interactions. This transition induces a shift from eye&#8208;perceived green (B) to blue (C) room&#8208;temperature luminescence for these molecular solids. Photophysical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory calculations have been conducted to identify the origins of the emission properties lying in these structurally related assemblies, and suggest that thermally activated delayed fluorescence dominates the radiative relaxation pathways. This study highlights the innovative feature of Cu(I) derivatives, offering access to stimuli&#8208;sensitive materials that can witness, a posteriori, the exceeding of critical temperatures in their environment.

An engineered palladium sub&#8208;nanoclusters on nickel ditelluride accelerated water dissociation kinetics to promote the protonation of OOH* intermediate, and hence significantly enhanced performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from oxygen reduction reaction via a two&#8208;electron pathway is vital as an alternative for the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, this process is largely hindered in neutral and alkaline conditions due to sluggish kinetics associated with the transformation of intermediate O2* into OOH* via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer sourced from slow water dissociation. Herein, we developed Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters on the nickel ditelluride nanosheets (Pd SNCs/NiTe2) to enhance the performance of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The newly&#8208;developed Pd SNCs/NiTe2 exhibited a H2O2 selectivity of as high as 99&#8201;% and a positive shift of onset potential up to 0.81&#8197;V. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental studies (e.g., X&#8208;ray absorption and attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements) revealed that the Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters supported by NiTe2 nanosheets efficiently reduced the energy barrier of water dissociation to generate more protons, facilitating the proton feeding kinetics. When used in a flow cell, Pd SNCs/NiTe2 cathode efficiently produced H2O2 with a maximum yield rate of 1.75&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a current efficiency of 95&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Further, an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 1.43&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 was reached after 10&#8197;hours of continuous electrolysis, showing the potential for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Enantioconvergent Reductive Couplings of Racemic Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/Cr/Co triple catalytic radical enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes is developed. This method is applicable to various allenyl sulfones and allenyl esters, providing a versatile and robust platform for the construction of synthetically valuable homoallylic alcohols bearing an internal carbon&#8208;carbon double bond with excellent efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;based enantioconvergent reactions have become a powerful strategy to synthesize enantiopure compounds from racemic starting materials. However, existing methods primarily address precursors with central chirality, neglecting those with axial chirality. Herein, we describe the enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes, facilitated by a photoredox, chromium, and cobalt triple catalysis system. This method selectively affords one product from sixteen possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers. The protocol leverages CoIII&#8722;H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical&#8208;based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.

         <title>Boosting K+&#8208;Ionic Conductivity of Layered Oxides via Regulating P2/P3 Heterogeneity and Reciprocity for Room&#8208;Temperature Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;faceted strategy is deployed to overcome the K+&#8208;ion transport resistance of a layered solid electrolyte, P2/P3&#8208;K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2, at both atomic and macro scales. As a result, a record&#8208;high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is achieved. Moreover, the modified solid electrolyte enables durable potassium metal batteries, outperforming organic liquid electrolyte.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high energy density and inherent safety. However, solid state K&#8208;ion conductors struggle with poor ionic conductivity due to the large ionic radius of K+&#8208;ions. Herein, we report precise regulation of phase heterogeneity and reciprocity of the P2/P3&#8208;symbiosis K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2 solid electrolyte (SE) for boosting a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The bulk ionic conducting mechanism is explored by elucidating the effect of atomic stacking mode within the layered framework on K+&#8208;ion migration barriers. For ion diffusion at grain boundaries, the P2/P3 biphasic symbiosis property assists in tunning the SE microstructure, which crystallizes in rod&#8208;like particles with lengths of tens of micrometers facilitating long&#8208;distance ion transport and significantly decreasing grain boundary resistance. Potassium metal symmetric cells using the modified SE deliver excellent cycling life over 300&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high critical current density of 0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (QSSKBs) coupled with two kinds of layered oxide cathodes demonstrate remarkable stability over 300&#8197;cycles, outperforming the liquid electrolyte counterparts. The QSSKB system provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficiency, safe, and durable large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>As Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Meets with Noncovalent Conformational Locks: Subtly Regulating NIR&#8208;II Molecules for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Navigated Synergistic Therapies</title>

         <dc:description>
Ingenious integration of NoCLs into AIE&#8208;active molecular architecture endows the constructed molecule TEEITQ with superior absorption capacity, bright NIR&#8208;II emission and prominent photothermal effect simultaneously. Those features enable them to perform well in the NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemo&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy towards cancer.







Abstract
Phototheranostics is growing into a sparking frontier in disease treatment. Developing single molecular species synchronously featured by powerful absorption capacity, superior second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence and prominent photothermal conversion ability is highly desirable for phototheranostics, yet remains formidably challenging. In this work, we propose a molecular design philosophy that the integration of noncovalent conformational locks (NoCLs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in a single formulation is able to boost multiple photophysical properties for efficient phototheranostics. The introduction of NoCLs skeleton with conformation&#8208;locking feature in the center of molecular architecture indeed elevates the structural planarity and rigidity, which simultaneously promotes the absorption capacity and bathochromic&#8208;shifts the emission wavelength centered in NIR&#8208;II region. Meanwhile, the AIE tendency mainly originated from flexibly propeller&#8208;like geometry at the ends of molecular architecture eventually endows the molecule with satisfactory emission intensity and photothermal conversion in aggregates. Consequently, by utilizing the optimized molecule, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemo synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor ablation.

         <title>Probing Twist&#8208;Induced Endocytotic Membrane Fission using Anisotropic Gold Homodimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dumbbell&#8208;shaped gold homodimers (AuHD) were developed as an anisotropic probe to real&#8208;time monitoring of live endocytic vesicles under DFM for the kinetic study of dynamin&#8208;induced lipid remodeling underlying membrane fission.







Abstract
Membrane fission involves a crucial step of lipid remodeling, in which the dynamin collar constricts and severs the tubulated lipid membrane at the neck of budding vesicles. Nevertheless, the difficulty in accurately determining the rotational dynamics of live endocytotic vesicles poses a limit on the elucidation of dynamin&#8208;induced membrane remodeling for endocytotic vesicle scission. Herein, we designed a DNA&#8208;modified gold homodimer (AuHD)&#8208;based anisotropic plasmonic probe with uniform surface chemistry, minimizing orientational fluctuation within vesicle encapsulation. Using AuHDs as cargos to image the dynamics of cargo&#8208;containing vesicles during endocytosis, we showed that, prior to detachment from plasma membrane, the cargo&#8208;containing vesicles underwent multiple intermittent twists of ~4&#176; angular orientation relative to plasma membrane with a ~0.2&#8197;s dwell time. These findings suggest that the membrane torques resulting from dynamin actions in vivo constitute the pathway to membrane fission, potentially shedding light on how dynamin&#8208;mediated lipid remodeling orchestrates membrane fission.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Boron Amino Acid for Positron Emission Tomography and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

BBPA is a boramino acid derived from the rational design of BPA, serving as a theranostic agent for both PET imaging and BNCT. It shares the same chemical structure, differing only in isotopic composition, which allows [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET to be seamlessly integrated with BBPA&#8208;BNCT, offering a boron delivery capacity that surpasses that of BPA.







Abstract
Trifluoroborate boronophenylalanine (BBPA) is a boron amino acid analog of 4&#8208;boronophenylalanine (BPA) but with a trifluoroborate group (&#8722;BF3&#8722;) instead of a carboxyl group (&#8722;COOH). Clinical studies have shown that 18F&#8722;labeled BBPA ([18F]BBPA) can produce high&#8208;contrast tumor images in positron emission tomography (PET). Beyond PET imaging, BBPA is a theranostic agent for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Because BBPA possesses an identical chemical structure to BNCT and PET, it can potentially predict the boron concentration for BNCT using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. The synthesis of BBPA was achieved by selectively fluorinating the &#945;&#8208;aminoborate compound, taking advantage of the varying rates of solvolysis of the B&#8722;F bond. The study showcased the high&#8208;contrast [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET imaging in various tumor models, highlighting its broad applicability for both [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET and BBPA&#8208;BNCT. [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET tumor uptake remains consistent across various doses, including those used in BNCT. This enables accurate estimation of the boron concentration in tumors using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. With its dual boron structure, BBPA increases boron concentration in tumor cells and tumor tissues compared to BPA. Thus, less boron carrier is needed. This study introduces a new theranostic boron carrier that enhances boron accumulation in tumors, predicts boron concentration, and enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of BNCT.

This study developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8211;Khand polymerization method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli.







Abstract
Polymers containing lactam structures play a crucial role in both natural biological systems and human life, and their synthesis, functions and applications are of utmost importance for biomimetics and the creation of new materials. In this study, we developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8211;Khand polymerization (h&#8208;PKP) method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights of the resulting poly(N&#8722;Ts/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers exhibit high solid&#8208;state luminescence and demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli. They further demonstrate strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability. The unique dual&#8208;emission peaks observed in poly(N&#8722;H/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s obtained through post&#8208;treatment under acidic conditions demonstrate a mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular excited&#8208;state proton transfer specific to lactam structures. The efficient one&#8208;pot synthetic method for poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam) provides a novel strategy for constructing polymers with &#947;&#8208;lactam structures in the main chain and the simple and efficient post&#8208;modification method offer a versatile toolbox for functionalizing poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s to expand their potential applications.

         <title>Planar Chiral Charge&#8208;Transfer Cyclophanes: Convenient Synthesis, Circularly Polarized Light&#8208;Responsive Photothermal Conversion and Supramolecular Chiral Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering charge transfer(CT) and planar chirality by judicious choice of donor unit is achieved in enforced densely &#960;&#8208;stacking D/A Cyclophanes. CT absorption band can be tuned from visible to near&#8208;infrared region. As for the two planar chiral CT cyclophanes, one shows chiral selectivity for incident circularly polarized(CP) light for photothermal conversion, while another can stack into helical structure to amplify molecular planar chirality.







Abstract
We report herein a series of macrocycles in which the densely &#960;&#8208;stacked charge&#8208;transfer (CT) donor/acceptor with naphthalenediimides (NDIs) or perylene diimide (PDI) as acceptor moiety pairing various donor moieties are locked by covalent bond. The X&#8208;ray crystallography of C8BDT&#8208;NDI reveals a short intramolecular &#960;&#8208;stacking distance around 3.4&#8197;&#197; and the existence of intermolecular donor/acceptor &#960;&#8208;stacking (3.7&#8197;&#197;). The intramolecular CT is highly dependent on the electron&#8208;donating ability of donor moiety and replacing carbazole (C8KZ) with benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (C8BDT) or dihydroindolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (C8DN) redshift CT absorption into NIR region. Notably, both C8BDT&#8208;NDI and C8DN&#8208;NDI demonstrate excellent photothermal performance, which is a result of the active non&#8208;radiative pathways. Interestingly, the different molecular symmetry between donor and acceptor moiety in cyclophanes endow C8BDT&#8208;NDI and C8DN&#8208;NDI with intrinsic planar chirality. The enantiomeric C8BDT&#8208;NDI shows chiral selectivity for incident light, i.e., when irradiated by left&#8208;circularly polarized light, (R)&#8208;C8BDT&#8208;NDI is more sensitive and a higher maximum stable temperature is achieved. While, enantiomeric C8DN&#8208;NDI pack with different orientations forming M&#8208; and P&#8208;handedness helix, respectively, demonstrating molecular planar chirality being transferred and amplified through molecular assembly. These results provide insight into the intramolecular charge transfer in enforced D/A &#960;&#8208;stacks in which CT interactions and planar chirality would be engineered through structural control.

         <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;Supporting Single&#8208;Component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals are studied to serve as a self&#8208;supporting single&#8208;component catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in&#8197;which the coordinately unsaturated ZnOx sites derived from ZnO4 tetrahedra on the Zn2SiO4 surface function as catalytic centers. Due to its single&#8208;component crystalline nature and the presence of Zn&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonds, Zn2SiO4 exhibits superior durability for PDH compared to the supported ZnO catalysts.







Abstract
Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction&#8216;s induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200&#8201;hours of PDH operation at 550&#8201;&#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000&#8201;hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.

         <title>Engineering Spacer Conjugation for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of highly conjugated spacers has led to the development of efficient and stable 2D/3D PSCs. These organic spacers enhance charge transport and improve resistance to moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% in 24.8&#8208;cm2 modules. Furthermore, the devices maintained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3000&#8197;hours of operation under MPP tracking, establishing them as one of the most stable 2D/3D PSCs to date.







Abstract
Incorporating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite in 3D perovskite absorber holds great potential to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;based 2D structures often exhibit poor charge transport and are prone to formation of charge&#8208;extraction barrier that impedes efficient device operation. We address these issues by introducing aromatic spacers with molecular conjugation into 2D perovskites locating between 3D perovskites and electron charge transport layers. Among our tested aromatic spacers, the pyrenylbutanamine (PyBA) spacer was shown to endow 2D perovskites with superior charge transport properties and efficient charge extraction from the bulk perovskite in 2D/3D PSCs, due to the highest degree of conjugation. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.3&#8201;% in a 0.16&#8208;cm2 single cell and 21.0&#8201;% in a 24.8&#8208;cm2 module. Moreover, the incorporated PyBA substantially raised the resistance of 2D/3D PSCs against moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced environmental, thermal, and operational stability. Notably, the PyBA&#8208;based devices retained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 2000&#8197;hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;% relative humidity, or 1000&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity, or 3000&#8197;hours of operation under continuous 1&#8208;Sun illumination at 40&#8201;&#176;C, showcasing their exceptionally high stability compared to previously reported 2D/3D PSCs.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkynes with CO2: En Route to Axially Chiral Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic atroposelective carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes with CO2 is reported. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, Z/E and enantio&#8208;selectivities. An unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes.







Abstract
Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, Z/E and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti&#8208;selectivity in vinyl&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes.

         <title>Designing Cooperative Ion Transport Pathway in Ultra&#8208;Thin Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes toward Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was proposed to confine PVDF&#8722;HFP inside pores of fluorinated covalent organic frameworks (CF3&#8722;COF) to synergistically enhance ion transport within polymer matrices. The long&#8208;ordered ion transfer pathway can effective enhance ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The insights gained from this research could pave the way for the development of more efficient and stable solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries toward practicalization.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their decent flexibility, safety, and interfacial stability. However, their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and limited conductivity, leading to inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we proposed to design ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte with long&#8208;range cooperative ion transport pathway to effectively increase the ionic conductivity and stability. The impregnation of PVDF&#8722;HFP inside pores of fluorinated covalent organic framework (CF3&#8722;COF) can disrupt its symmetry, rendering rapid ion transportation and inhibited anion immigration. The functional groups of CF3&#8722;COF can interact with PVDF&#8722;HFP to form fast Li+ transport channels, which enables the uniform and confined Li+ conduction within the electrolyte. The introduction of CF3&#8722;COF also enhances the mechanical strength and flexibility of SPEs, as well as ensures homogeneous Li deposition and inhibited dendrite growth. Hence, a remarkably high conductivity of 1.21&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 can be achieved. Finally, the ultra&#8208;thin SPEs with an extremely long cycle life exceed 9000&#8197;h can be obtained while the NCM523/Li pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 760&#8197;mAh and 96&#8201;% capacity retention after cycling, holding great promises to be utilized for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

Finally, the ultra-thin SPEs with an extremely long cycle life exceed 9000&#8197;h can be obtained while the NCM523/Li pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 760&#8197;mAh and 96&#8201;% capacity retention after cycling, holding great promises to be utilized for practical solid-state Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer between the water and polydopamine interfaces under ultrasonic stimulation effectively enables the activation of oxygen under mild conditions, leading to the oxidation of methane by derived reactive oxygen species, a process that can be intensified if the catalyst suspension is pre&#8208;illuminated for a period in an oxygenated atmosphere.







Abstract
The direct conversion and efficient utilization of methane pose a critical scientific challenge. Indirect activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers a high probability of contact with methane and conversion efficiency under mild conditions. However, reported product yields are suboptimal due to challenges in activating oxygen and facilitating mass transfer in suspension systems. We propose the use of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), employing polydopamine (PDA) as a catalyst that undergoes electron transfer with oxygen under ultrasound, generating ROS that drives the partial oxidation of methane (POM). Corresponding experimental results indicate that CH3OH and most HCHO are produced directly from CH4. Furthermore, through in situ characterizations, we have shown that light pretreatment of the catalysts in an oxygenated atmosphere facilitates the forming of more C=O functional groups with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, thereby significantly enhancing overall product yields, particularly for CH3OH. Within two hours, product yields reach 1.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for HCHO and 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for CH3OH. This work introduces a novel approach for efficient POM, while highlighting the distinctive catalytic properties of PDA.

         <title>Surface Cladding Engineering via Oxygen Sulfur Distribution for Stable Electrocatalytic Oxygen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This word developed a surface&#8208;cladding strategy in oxygen&#8208;sulfur interface to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen in OER. Multiple in situ characterization technologies and density functional theory calculations reveal that that the stable interfacial O&#8722;Ni&#8722;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8722;O covalency. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the balance between activity and stability and thus enhances the electrochemical performance by controlling coating interface.







Abstract
Inevitable leaching and corrosion under anodic oxidative environment greatly restrict the lifespan of most catalysts with excellent primitive activity for oxygen production. Here, based on Fick&#8217; s Law, we present a surface cladding strategy to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen triggering by directional flow of interfacial electrons and strong electronic interactions via constructing elaborately cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure with controlled surface thickness. Multiple in situ characterization technologies indicated that this strategy can effectively prevent the irreversible Ni ions leaching and inhibit lattice oxygen from participating in anodic reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the stable interfacial O&#8722;Ni&#8722;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8722;O covalency. This would suppress the overoxidation of Ni and simultaneously fixing the lattice oxygen, thus enabling catalysts with boosted corrosion resistance without sacrificing its activity. Consequently, this cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure exhibits excellent performance with a low overpotential of 256&#8197;mV after 500&#8197;h. Based on Fick's law, this work demonstrates the positive effect of surface modification through precisely adjusting of the oxygen&#8208;sulfur exchange process, which has paved an innovative and effective way to solve the instability problem of anodic oxidation.

         <title>Glycosylated AIE&#8208;active Red Light&#8208;triggered Photocage with Precisely Tumor Targeting Capability for Synergistic Type I Photodynamic Therapy and CPT Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a lactosylated photocage prodrug that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles BT&#8208;LRCs for type I photodynamic therapy and camptothecin (CPT) chemotherapy. Under the regulation of lactose units, BT&#8208;LRCs exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior and remarkable superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation efficiency, and CPT was subsequently released upon light irradiation. This strategy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic effect in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Photocaging is an emerging protocol for precisely manipulating spatial and temporal behaviors over biological activity. However, the red/near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered photolysis process of current photocage is largely singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;dependent and lack of compatibility with other reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated techniques, which has proven to be the major bottleneck in achieving efficient and precise treatment. Herein, we reported a lactosylated photocage BT&#8208;LRC by covalently incorporating camptothecin (CPT) into hybrid BODIPY&#8208;TPE fluorophore via the superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;)&#8208;cleavable thioketal bond for type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anticancer drug release. Amphiphilic BT&#8208;LRC could be self&#8208;assembled into aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanoparticles (BT&#8208;LRCs) owing to the regulation of carbohydrate&#8208;carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) among neighboring lactose units in the nanoaggregates. BT&#8208;LRCs could simultaneously generate abundant O2&#8722;&#8901; through the aggregation modulated by lactose interactions, and DNA&#8208;damaging agent CPT was subsequently and effectively released. Notably, the type I PDT and CPT chemotherapy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic efficacy in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Furthermore, the inherent AIE property of BT&#8208;LRCs endowed the photocaged prodrug with superior bioimaging capability, which provided a powerful tool for real&#8208;time tracking and finely tuning the PDT and photoactivated drug release behavior in tumor therapy.

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Arylation using Alternating Polarity in flow for Compound Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of compound libraries in flow enabled the C&#8722;X arylation of&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds in the presence of diverse amines (including sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid electrode passivation.







Abstract
Etherification and amination of aryl halide scaffolds are commonly used reactions in parallel medicinal chemistry to rapidly scan structure&#8211;activity relationships with abundant building blocks. Electrochemical methods for aryl etherification and amination demonstrate broad functional group tolerance and extended nucleophile scope compared to traditional methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for robust and scale&#8208;transferable workflows for electrochemical compound library synthesis. Herein we describe a platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of C&#8722;X arylation (X=NH, OH) in flow to access compound libraries. A comprehensive Design of Experiment (DoE) study identifies an optimal protocol which generates high yields across&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds, diverse amines (including electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). Reaction sequences are automated on commercially available equipment to generate libraries of anilines and aryl ethers. The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid accumulating electrode passivation. Moreover, it enables reactions to be performed in air, without supporting electrolyte and with high reproducibility over consecutive runs. Our method represents a powerful means to rapidly generate nucleophile independent C&#8722;X arylation compound libraries using flow electrochemistry.

         <title>Parallel and High Throughput Reaction Monitoring with Computer Vision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel computer vision&#8208;based method for monitoring parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE) is presented. Unlike previous methods, this approach captures the kinetics of multiple reactions in a single video. Case studies demonstrate its applicability in diverse chemical processes, offering insights into reaction discovery, mechanistic understanding, and optimization, with potential benefits for machine learning&#8208;driven chemical exploration.







Abstract
We report the development and applications of a computer vision based reaction monitoring method for parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE). Whereas previous efforts reported methods to extract bulk kinetics of one reaction from one video, this new approach enables one video to capture bulk kinetics of multiple reactions running in parallel. Case studies, in and beyond well&#8208;plate high throughput settings, are described. Analysis of parallel dye&#8208;quenching hydroxylations, DMAP&#8208;catalysed esterification, solid&#8208;liquid sedimentation dynamics, metal catalyst degradation, and biologically&#8208;relevant sugar&#8208;mediated nitro reduction reactions have each provided insight into the scope and limitations of camera&#8208;enabled high throughput kinetics as a means of widening known analytical bottlenecks in HTE for reaction discovery, mechanistic understanding, and optimisation. It is envisaged that the nature of the multi&#8208;reaction time&#8208;resolved datasets made available by this analytical approach will later serve a broad range of downstream efforts in machine learning approaches to exploring chemical space.

         <title>Selective Monoborylation of Methane by a Mono Bipyridyl&#8208;Nickel(II) Hydride Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework confined mono bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species is highly efficient for selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis. This heterogeneous and recyclable single&#8208;site nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane to afford methylboronic acid pinacol ester (CH3Bpin) in 98&#8201;% selectivity with a turnover number up to 1388.







Abstract
We report the development of an earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst for methane C&#8722;H borylation. The post&#8208;synthetic metalation of bipyridine&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with NiBr2, followed by treatment with NaEt3BH affords MOF&#8208;supported monomeric bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species via active site isolation. The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH3Bpin in 61&#8201;% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH2&#8208;species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8722;Ni catalyst, its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl&#8208;nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover&#8208;limiting &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF&#8208;based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Nanohoops Favour Light&#8208;Induced Energy Transfer over Charge Separation in Porphyrin/[10]CPP/Fullerene Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two different nanohoops in elaborate porphyrin/(aza)[10]CPP/fullerene [2]rotaxanes (CPP: cycloparaphenylene) have been shown to act as &#8220;supramolecular shields&#8221; and completely prevent through&#8208;space electron transfer between the electron&#8208;donating porphyrin and electron&#8208;accepting fullerene. These findings shed light on some previously unexplained results and open the door for future strategic uses of strained carbon nanohoops.







Abstract
[2]Rotaxanes offer unique opportunities for studying and modulating charge separation and energy transfer, because the mechanical bond allows the robust, yet spatially dynamic tethering of photoactive groups. In this work, we synthesized [2]rotaxane triads comprising a central (aza)[10]CPP&#8835;C60 bis&#8208;adduct complex and two zinc porphyrin stoppers to address how the movable nanohoop affects light&#8208;induced charge separation and energy transfer between the rotaxane subcomponents. We found that neither the parent nanohoop [10]CPP nor its electron&#8208;deficient analogue aza[10]CPP actively participate in charge separation. In contrast, the nanohoops completely prevented through&#8208;space charge separation. This result is likely due to supramolecular &#8220;shielding&#8221;, because charge separation was observed in the thread that acted as reference dyad. On the other hand, the suppression of electron transfer allowed the observation of energy transfer from the porphyrin triplet to the fullerene triplet state with a lifetime of ca. 25&#8197;&#956;s. The presence of the interlocked nanohoops therefore leads to a dramatic switch between charge separation and energy transfer. We suggest that our results explain observations made by others in photovoltaic devices comprising nanohoops and may pave the way toward strategic uses of mechanically interlocked architectures in devices that feature (triplet) energy transfer.

         <title>A Supramolecular&#8208;Nanocage&#8208;Based Framework Stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Interactions with Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework was firstly reported, which can serve as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The H2 evolution rate reaches as high as 524012&#8197;&#956;mol/gPt/h.







Abstract
&#960; frameworks, defined as a type of porous supramolecular materials weaved from conjugated molecular units by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, provide a new direction in photocatalysis. However, such examples are rarely reported. Herein, we report a supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework constructed from a photoactive Cu(I) complex unit. Structurally, 24 Cu(I) complex units stack together through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, forming a truncated octahedral nanocage with sodalite topology. The inner diameter of the nanocage is 2.8&#8197;nm. By sharing four open faces, each nanocage connects with four equivalent ones, forming a 3D porous &#960; framework (&#960;&#8208;2). &#960;&#8208;2 shows good thermal and chemical stability, which can adsorb CO2, iodine, and methyl orange molecules. More importantly, &#960;&#8208;2 can serve as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. With ultrafine Pt subnanometer particles (0.9&#177;0.1&#8197;nm) incorporated into the nanocages as a co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches a record&#8208;high value of 524012&#8197;&#956;mol/gPt/h in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the ultrafine size of the Pt particles, as well as the fast electron transfer from &#960;&#8208;2 to the highly active Pt upon illumination. &#960;&#8208;2 represents the unique stable supramolecular&#8208;cage&#8208;based &#960; framework with excellent photocatalytic activity.

         <title>A CaI2&#8208;Based Electrolyte Enabled by Borate Ester Anion Receptors for Reversible Ca&#8722;Organic and Ca&#8722;Se Batteries</title>

We report that CaI2/dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca metal anodes via forming CaI2&#8208;involved solid electrolyte interphase with a low Ca2+ diffusion barrier, expanding the Ca electrolyte chemistry and demonstrating the potential of inorganic phases for Ca2+ diffusion. Ca reversibility is further boosted by introducing tris(2H&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl) borate anion receptors, enabling reversible Ca&#8722;Se full cells.







Abstract
Passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in Ca metal anodes constitute a long&#8208;standing challenge, as they block Ca2+ transport and inhibit reversible Ca deposition/stripping. Current solutions focus primarily on boron/aluminum&#8208;based electrolytes to mitigate such interfacial issues by producing Ca2+&#8208;conductive species, yet the complex synthetic procedure of these salts restricts the widespread application. Moreover, whether any inorganic phases possess decent Ca2+ conductivity within SEIs remains ambiguous. Herein, we report that a commercially available CaI2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca/Ca2+ redox reactions via forming CaI2&#8208;involved SEI, inspired by our density functional theory calculations where CaI2 species is predicted to possess the lowest Ca2+ diffusion barrier among a range of inorganic phases. We further materialize this finding by introducing a serial of borate ester anion receptors, resulting in the formation of CaI2/borides hybrid SEIs with an enhanced Ca2+ conductivity. Consequently, the resultant electrolytes realize a 7&#8208;fold reduction in deposition/stripping overpotential compared to anion receptor&#8208;free one, allowing for the construction of reversible Ca&#8208;metal full cells with high&#8208;capacity selenium and organic cathodes.

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Induces Hydrogen Spillover and Platinum Utilization in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

With the substitution of carbon black by WS2, a strong hydrogen binding strength is observed for Pt; thereby, the hydrogen spillover is occurred during HER catalysis; moreover, WS2 slightly affects the Pt in different layers and more Pt atoms involve in HER; thus, the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction for boosted HER performance is revealed.







Abstract
The substantial promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance relies on the breakup of the Sabatier principle, which can be achieved by the alternation of the support and electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) is noticed. Due to the utilization of tungsten disulfides as support for platinum (Pt@WS2), surprisingly, Pt@WS2 demands only 31&#8197;mV overpotential to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic HER test, corresponding to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher mass activity than benchmarked Pt/C. The pH dependent electrochemical measurements associated with H2&#8208;TPD and in situ Raman spectroscopy indicate a hydrogen spillover involved HER mechanism is confirmed. The WS2 support triggers a higher hydrogen binding strength for Pt leading to the increment in hydrogen concentration at Pt sites proved by upshifted d band center as well as lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen, favourable for hydrogen spillover. Besides, the WS2 shows a comparably lower effect on Gibbs free energy for different Pt layers (&#8722;0.50&#8197;eV layer&#8722;1) than carbon black (&#8722;0.88&#8197;eV layer&#8722;1) contributing to a better Pt utilization. Also, the theoretical calculation suggests the hydrogen spillover occurs on the 3rd Pt layer in Pt@WS2; moreover, the energy barrier is lowered with increment in hydrogen coverage on Pt. Therefore, the boosted HER activity attributes to the EMSI effect caused hydrogen spillover and enhancement in Pt utilization efficiency.

         <title>Selectivity Modulation of Multistep Reduction Reactions by Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effect of Au could influence the selectivity of the nitrobenzene reduction reaction. The supported Au nanoclusters exhibited stronger adsorption to the azoxybenzene intermediate, thus inhibiting further reduction and achieving high azoxybenzene selectivity, whereas the supported Au nanoparticles converted nitrobenzene to the further reduced product azobenzene. This work provides a new insight into the establishment of structure&#8208;reactivity relationships.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of valuable azo&#8208; and azoxyaromatic chemicals via transfer coupling of nitroaromatic compounds has been achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the catalyst structure. Here, a direct method to modulate nitrobenzene reduction and selectively alter the product from azobenzene to azoxybenzene by employing the size effect of Au is reported. Au nanoclusters (NCs) with smaller sizes embedded in ZIF&#8208;8 controllably converted nitrobenzene into azoxybenzene, while supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) selectively catalyzed nitrobenzene reduction to azobenzene. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy on CO adsorption (CO&#8208;DRIFTS) of Au NC/ZIF&#8208;8 revealed a higher valence state and a lower electron density of Au than that of Au NP/ZIF&#8208;8, combined with the desorption of azoxybenzene from the Au NC and Au NP surface, suggesting that the Au NCs with lower electron density exhibit stronger adsorption. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge density difference maps indicated that azoxybenzene bonded to Au NC/ZIF&#8208;8 with greater adsorption energy, resulting in more electron transfer between azoxybenzene and the generated Au sites, which inhibited further reduction of azoxybenzene and resulted in high azoxybenzene selectivity. The application of the size effect of Au particles to regulate nitrobenzene transfer coupling provided new insights into the structure&#8208;selectivity relationships.

A regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, allenes and conjugated dienes with modified masked phosphinylating reagent is established via synergistic Pd/Co catalysis. The stereodivergent protocol is also described to achieve all four stereoisomers of corresponding motifs.







Abstract
Different from the reported work focusing on the construction of single P&#8208; or C&#8208;stereocenter via hydrophosphinylation of unsaturated carbon bonds, the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of allenes, conjugated enynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes is achieved via a designed Pd/Co dual catalysis and newly modified masked phosphinylating reagent. A series of allyl motifs bearing both a tertiary C&#8208; and P&#8208;stereocenter are prepared in generally good yields, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;rr and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. The unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes is established to generate skeletons containing both a P&#8208;stereocenter and a nonadjacent chiral axis. The first stereodivergent hydrophosphinylation reaction is also developed to achieve all four P&#8208;containing stereoisomers. The present protocol features the use of only 3&#8208;minutes reaction time and 0.1&#8201;% catalyst, and with the observation of up to 730 TON. A set of mechanistic studies reveal the necessity and roles of two metal catalysts and corroborate the designed synergistic process.

Photovoltaic devices constructed using these Se films exhibit an efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination and demonstrate minimal efficiency degradation after 20,000&#8197;hours of storage in an ambient atmosphere.







Abstract
The lanthanide contraction involves a reduction in atomic radius among f&#8208;block elements below the expected level. A similar contraction is observed in group&#8208;16 elements. The atomic radius of Se (117&#8197;pm) is slightly larger than that of S (104&#8197;pm) arising from the presence of d electrons, compared to the significant increase in atomic radius from O (73&#8197;pm) to S. This lanthanide&#8208;like contraction contributes to Se's robust oxidative resistance. Here we report a selective oxidation strategy utilizing Se's strong antioxidative property to remove coexisting narrow&#8208;band gap Te impurities from Se feedstocks. This strategy selectively oxidizes volatile Te impurities into involatile TeO2 that remains in the evaporation source, while only volatile Se deposits onto the substrate during the thermal&#8208;evaporation deposition process. This enables the fabrication of high&#8208;purity Se films possessing a wide band gap of 1.88&#8197;eV, ideally suited to the optimal band gap for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs). The resulting Se photovoltaics exhibit an efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination, outperforming market&#8208;dominant amorphous silicon and all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs. Unencapsulated Se devices show no efficiency degradation after 20,000&#8197;hours of storage in ambient atmosphere.

         <title>Organometallic Polymer Constructed by Active Fe&#8722;C12N8 Centers for Boosting Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic polymer constructed by Fe&#8722;C12N8 active centers was prepared and employed as a high&#8208;performance electrode material for sodium&#8208;ions batteries. Benefitting from the unique &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and metallic&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;C) bonds, organic&#8208;iron polymer with microsphere morphology exhibits large reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe&#8208;PDA&#8208;220) with a unique d&#8208;&#960; conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly&#8208;aminoquinone chains to form Fe&#8722;C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the distinctive Fe&#8722;C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 was delivered at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 106&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 5000&#8197;cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two&#8208;electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during the sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.

         <title>Evaluation of Active Oxygen Species Derived from Water Splitting for Electrocatalytic Organic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active oxygen species (specially OH*), derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds, whereas the relationship between them remains ambiguous. This work investigates the volcanic relationship between the activation of glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation over Au&#8208;based alloys and the coordination metal composition of OH*, as well as their effects on the selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products.







Abstract
Active oxygen species (OH*/O*) derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds into high&#8208;value chemicals, which can determine activity and selectivity, whereas the relationship between them remains unclear. Herein, using glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation as a model reaction, we systematically investigated the relationship between GLY oxidation activity and the formation energy of OH* (&#916;GOH*). We first identified that OH* on Au demonstrates the highest activity for GLY electrooxidation among various pure metals, based on experiments and density functional theory, and revealed that &#916;GOH* on Au&#8208;based alloys is influenced by the metallic composition of OH* coordination sites. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the adsorption energy of GLY (Eads) and the d&#8208;band center of Au&#8208;based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the &#916;GOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (&#916;Gads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate &#916;GOH* and &#916;Gads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonds Enable Efficient Photoreduction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ab initio molecular dynamics and excited&#8208;state calculations we demonstrate that the formation of chalcogen bonds between hydrosulfide anions and an organic heteroaromatic chromophore containing a sulfur atom enables efficient photoinduced electron transfer and photoreduction.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding interactions have attracted significant attention in a broad chemistry community, with a particular focus on their ability to stabilise the key transition states in various organic synthetic routes. In this work, we demonstrate that they can also be harnessed in selective photoredox reactions, which cannot be otherwise achieved with alternative approaches to photoreduction. We demonstrate this concept through the photoreduction of the sulfur&#8208;containing DNA nucleoside precursor thioanhydrouridine to 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;thiouridine, revealing the previously unrecognized role of bisulfide in this process. Based on quantum chemical simulations, we identify a stable chalcogen&#8208;bonding complex of the hydrosulfide anion and thionhydrouridine (HS&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S contacts), which enables directional photoinduced electron transfer, resulting in the formation of non&#8208;canonical DNA nucleoside. We also disprove the possibility that photoreduction of thioanhydronucleosides could be initiated by hydrated electrons generated from irradiated bisulfide anions which do not interact with the chromophore. Finally, we show that selective photoreduction mediated by chalcogen bonds can only occur for chromophores, which exhibit sufficiently long excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the locally&#8208;excited states to undergo transition to the productive charge transfer state. These findings can be further used in the design of similar photoredox reactions which can employ the potential of chalcogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Cold&#8208;Pressed Garnet Composite Electrolytes with Enhanced Li+ Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing Li+ conduction in cold&#8208;pressed Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (Ta&#8722;LZ) is achieved through the incorporation of Li6PS5Cl (LPSC). The formation of a Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure effectively integrates Ta&#8722;LZ with LPSC, facilitating interparticle Li+ transport. Moreover, Li dendrites and self&#8208;discharge are suppressed owing to the low electronic conductivity of Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC.







Abstract
Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) hold promise for realizing next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries with high energy density. However, the high stiffness of high&#8208;temperature sintered LLZO makes it brittle and susceptible to strain during the fabrication of solid&#8208;state batteries. Cold&#8208;pressed LLZO exhibits improved ductility but suffers from insufficient Li+ conductivity. Here, we report cold&#8208;pressed Ta&#8208;doped LLZO (Ta&#8722;LZ) particles integrated with ductile Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) via a Li+ conductive Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure. This configuration creates a continuous Li+ conduction network by enhancing the Li+ exchange at the Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC interface. The resulting Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE exhibits Li+ conductivity of 4.42&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.31&#8197;eV. Li symmetric cells with Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE demonstrate excellent Li dendrite suppression ability, with an improved critical current density of 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a prolonged cycle life exceeding 600&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our finding provides valuable insights into developing cold&#8208;pressed ceramic powder electrolytes for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Diboration of Unactivated Alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and enantioselective Pt&#8208;catalyzed diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan) has been achieved. A variety of structurally diverse differentiable 1,2&#8208;bis(boron) compounds are generated in useful yields with high levels of regio&#8208; and enantiocontrol. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity was governed by &#963;&#8208;donor abilities of the boryl ligands.







Abstract
Asymmetric diboration of terminal alkenes is well established, and subsequent selective functionalization of the less hindered primary boronic ester is commonly achieved. Conversely, selective functionalization of the sterically less accessible secondary boronic ester remains challenging. An alternative way to control chemoselective functionalization of bis(boron) compounds is by engendering different Lewis acidity to the two boryl moieties, since reactivity would then be dictated by Lewis acidity instead of sterics. We report herein the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Pt&#8208;catalyzed diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan). A broad range of terminal and cyclic alkenes undergo diboration to furnish the differentiable 1,2&#8208;bis(boron) compounds with high levels of regio&#8208; and enantiocontrol, giving access to a wide variety of novel building blocks from a common intermediate. The reaction places the less Lewis acidic B(dan) group at the less hindered position and the resulting 1,2&#8208;bisboryl alkanes undergo selective transformations of the B(pin) group located at the more hindered position. The regioselectivity of the diboration has been studied by DFT calculations and is believed to originate from the trans influence, which lowers the activation barrier for formation of the regioisomer that places the weaker electron donor [B(pin) vs B(dan)] opposite the strong electron donor (alkyl group) in the platinum complex.

         <title>Polyanionic Receptors for Carboxylates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate anions are important but challenging substrates for recognition in aqueous solution. These divalent receptors employ charge&#8208;neutral binding sites to bind simple carboxylates in water with no cosolvent, despite the presence of multiply anionic solubilising groups.







Abstract
Receptors for carboxylate anions have many possible biomedical applications, including mimicry of the vancomycin group of antibiotics. However, binding carboxylates in water, the biological solvent, is highly challenging due to the hydrophilicity of these polar anions. Here we report, for the first time, the recognition of simple carboxylates such as acetate and formate in water by synthetic receptors with charge&#8208;neutral binding sites. The receptors are solubilised by polyanionic side&#8208;chains which, remarkably, do not preclude anion binding. The tricyclic structures feature two identical binding sites linked by polyaromatic bridges, capable of folding into closed, twisted conformations. This folding is hypothesised to preorganise the structures for anion recognition, mimicking the process which generates many protein binding sites. The architecture is suitable for elaboration into enclosed structures with potential for selective recognition of biologically relevant carboxylates.

         <dc:description>
Synergistic two&#8208;color photochemistry is a powerful tool for controlling chemical reactivity. We introduce a system of photoswitches that in their on&#8208;state efficiently react to from a stable photoadduct in the presence of two colors of light and introduce a parameter that quantifies the degree of photochemical synergy of photochemical reactions: The synergistic ratio.







Abstract
The emergence of highly wavelength resolved reactivity information for complex photochemical reaction processes allows the establishment of multi&#8208;color reaction modes. One particularly powerful mode is the synergistic two&#8208;color reaction, where two colors of light have to be present in the same volume element to either enable or enhance photochemical reactivity that leads to a specific photoproduct. Herein, we introduce a two&#8208;color synergistic photochemical reaction system based on a diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) photoswitch and the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of a bridged ring&#8208;strained azobenzene (SA), which respond to ultraviolet (365&#8197;nm) and visible light (430&#8197;nm), respectively, with different rates, forming a well&#8208;defined heterocyclic photoadduct, DIOSA, that we structurally confirm via single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). To quantitatively capture the effectiveness of the dual&#8208;color irradiation as a function of the reaction conditions such as light intensity and starting material ratio as a function of product yield, we introduce a parameter, the photochemical synergistic ratio

         <title>Rectifying Heterointerface Facilitated C&#8722;N Coupling Dynamics Enables Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis Under Ultralow Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ electroreduction obtained Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with rectifying heterointerfaces modulates the adsorption behavior of *CO intermediate to enhance its combination with *NOH for subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics, which achieves a novel and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, resulting in the outstanding Faradaic efficiency and substantial yields across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling for urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional Bosch&#8208;Meiser method. However, the complexity of intermediates in co&#8208;reduction hampers simultaneous improvement in urea yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we developed a Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with nanoscale rectifying heterointerfaces through precise controllable in situ electroreduction of Cu2O nanowires, achieving notable FE (32.6&#8211;47.0&#8201;%) and substantial yields (6.08&#8211;30.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials (0 to &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE). Operando synchrotron radiation&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR&#8208;FTIR) confirmed the formation of *CO intermediates and C&#8722;N bonds, subsequently density functional theory (DFT) calculations deciphered that the Cu/Cu2O rectifying heterointerface modulated *CO adsorption, significantly enhancing subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics between *CO and *NOH intermediates. This work not only provides a groundbreaking and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, but also offers deep insights into copper&#8208;based heterointerface catalysts for urea synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The in situ electroreduction obtained Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with rectifying heterointerfaces modulates the adsorption behavior of *CO intermediate to enhance its combination with *NOH for subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics, which achieves a novel and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, resulting in the outstanding Faradaic efficiency and substantial yields across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling for urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional Bosch-Meiser method. However, the complexity of intermediates in co-reduction hampers simultaneous improvement in urea yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we developed a Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with nanoscale rectifying heterointerfaces through precise controllable in situ electroreduction of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanowires, achieving notable FE (32.6&#8211;47.0&#8201;%) and substantial yields (6.08&#8211;30.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials (0 to &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE). Operando synchrotron radiation-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR) confirmed the formation of *CO intermediates and C&#8722;N bonds, subsequently density functional theory (DFT) calculations deciphered that the Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O rectifying heterointerface modulated *CO adsorption, significantly enhancing subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics between *CO and *NOH intermediates. This work not only provides a groundbreaking and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, but also offers deep insights into copper-based heterointerface catalysts for urea synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration and Stabilizing Crystal&#8208;Phase in Halide Perovskite via Directly Incorporated Fluoride Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity was directly inserted in lead halide perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand, which strongly suppressed ion migration and stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, leading to an advantageous device performance and operational stability.







Abstract
Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity has been under intensive investigation in perovskite solar cells due to its remarkable defect suppression and great improvement of device performance. Nevertheless, these researches only focus on the surface, grain boundaries, or interface modification, the direct insertion of F&#8722; into the crystal lattice of regular lead halide perovskite films is still unrevealed. Herein, F&#8722; was successfully incorporated into the perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand. The strong electronegativity of F&#8722; can strongly increase the binding energy of all the ions in CsPbI2Br and inhibit their defect formations. A trace amount of F&#8722; incorporation not only enhanced the optoelectronic properties but also effectively mitigated the ion migration and phase separation simultaneously. The photovoltaic performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells were significantly improved with a champion efficiency of 17.78&#8201;% (38.01&#8201;%) under AM 1.5G (1000 lux indoor light). Moreover, F&#8722; can also be directly inserted into the hybrid perovskite lattice and greatly stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, enabling efficient fully MA&#8208;free FAPbI3 devices with 25.10&#8201;% efficiency. Our strategy sheds light on F&#8208;containing perovskites and provides a promising way to tackle ion migration and stabilize the crystal phase in halide perovskites.

         <title>Constructing Targeted Strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s Configurations to Obtain Excellent Energy Density and Long Life for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micro&#8208;nano cathode material is constructed by using niobium pentoxide as an inducer, in which the strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s bonds are formed in the C2/m and the refined primary particles are stacked radially. As a result, the modified cathode material exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LMRs) deliver excellent energy density and exhibit low cost, which are considered as the most promising cathode materials for the next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the irreversible redox reaction of the oxygen atoms directly leads to release oxygen and intensifies phase transformation. Besides, the local stress and strain will be generated due to the unit&#8208;cell volume difference between R&#8208;3m and C2/m phases, which continuously aggravates the collapse of secondary particles. Herein, the strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s configurations at the Li1 sites of the TM&#8208;layer in the C2/m phase and secondary particles with the radial arrangement of refined primary particles are designed to inhibit oxygen release and relieve lattice stress by Nb2O5 treatment. Meanwhile, the preferential growth of the active {010} planes is presented to obtain an excellent transmission rate of Li+. As a result, the designed LMR delivers remarkable electrochemical properties with high discharge capacity and initial coulomb efficiency of 276&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 85&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;C, outstanding cycling retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles. This novel crystal structure combining oxygen coordination regulation and micro&#8208;nano scale design provides inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance LMRs.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Motion in the Rotaxanes and Catenanes Incorporating Flexible Calix[n]phyrin Stations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with dipyrromethane has opened a route to rotaxanes and catenanes incorporating calix[4]phyrin units. A new type of molecular motion, termed fluttering, has been observed and simple chemical transformations such as methylation and (de)protonation of the [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane enables controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible mechanically interlocked compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with one or two dipyrromethane groups has opened a route for the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules incorporating various porphyrinoid stations. The exploitation of those precursors allowed the creation of [3]rotaxanes and [2]catenanes based on the calix[4]phyrin motif, presenting intriguing molecular dynamics. The intrinsic flexibility of the porphyrinoid allowed the introduction of a new type of molecular motion within the rotaxanes, termed fluttering. The latter involved a bending of the axle, interconverting two angular&#8208;shaped stereoisomers of the rotaxane through a planarised transition state. Simple chemical transformations, i.e. methylation and (de)protonation of the [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane allowed controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible calix[4]phyrin&#8208;incorporated mechanically interlocked porphyrinoids.

         <title>A&#8208;Site Engineering with Thiophene&#8208;Based Ammonium for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D/3D Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene&#8208;based cations are introduced in tin halide perovskites to form 2D/3D heterojunctions, in which 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (3&#8208;TEA) leads to the most compact crystal packing of [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedral layers with the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the resultant 2D phase. This effect facilitates charge transfer in the tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells and improves the device efficiency and stability.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites are the most promising candidate materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) thanks to their low toxicity and ideal band gap energies. The introduction of 2D/3D mixed perovskite phases in tin&#8208;based PSCs (TPSCs) has proven to be the most effective approach to improving device efficiency and stability. However, a 2D perovskite phase normally shows relatively low carrier mobility, which will be unfavorable for carrier transfer in the devices. In this work, we used a thiophene&#8208;based cation 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (3&#8208;TEA) as a spacer to form a novel 2D perovskite phase in TPSCs, which shows the most promising effect on the performance enhancement in comparison with other cations like 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (2&#8208;TEA) and benzene&#8208;based 2&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (PEA). Theoretical calculations reveal that 3&#8208;TEA enables the most compact crystal packing of [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedral layers, resulting in the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the 2D phase. This effect significantly enhances device efficiency and stability by facilitating more efficient carrier transfer within the 2D phase. These findings indicate that thiophene&#8208;based 2D perovskites are well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;performance TPSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Thiophene-based cations are introduced in tin halide perovskites to form 2D/3D heterojunctions, in which 2-(thiophen-3-yl)ethan-1-aminium (3-TEA) leads to the most compact crystal packing of [SnI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral layers with the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the resultant 2D phase. This effect facilitates charge transfer in the tin-based perovskite solar cells and improves the device efficiency and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin halide perovskites are the most promising candidate materials for lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) thanks to their low toxicity and ideal band gap energies. The introduction of 2D/3D mixed perovskite phases in tin-based PSCs (TPSCs) has proven to be the most effective approach to improving device efficiency and stability. However, a 2D perovskite phase normally shows relatively low carrier mobility, which will be unfavorable for carrier transfer in the devices. In this work, we used a thiophene-based cation 2-(thiophen-3-yl)ethan-1-aminium (3-TEA) as a spacer to form a novel 2D perovskite phase in TPSCs, which shows the most promising effect on the performance enhancement in comparison with other cations like 2-(thiophen-2-yl)ethan-1-aminium (2-TEA) and benzene-based 2-phenylethan-1-aminium (PEA). Theoretical calculations reveal that 3-TEA enables the most compact crystal packing of [SnI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedral layers, resulting in the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the 2D phase. This effect significantly enhances device efficiency and stability by facilitating more efficient carrier transfer within the 2D phase. These findings indicate that thiophene-based 2D perovskites are well-suited for high-performance TPSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Oxidation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photocatalytic method to selectively oxidise 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) to 5&#8208;formylcytosine under mild, aqueous conditions. At the single&#8208;nucleotide level, this C&#8722;H oxidation is highly selective for 5mC while leaving T and G intact. At the oligonucleotide level, some off&#8208;target oxidation was observed. Base&#8208;resolution proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sequencing of 5mC was demonstrated on a synthetic oligonucleotide.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;H activation on complex biological macromolecules is a key goal in the field of organic chemistry. It requires thermodynamically challenging chemical transformations to be delivered under mild, aqueous conditions. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC) is a fundamentally important epigenetic modification in DNA that has major implications for biology and has emerged as a vital biomarker. Selective functionalisation of 5mC would enable new chemical approaches to tag, detect and map DNA methylation to enhance the study and exploitation of this epigenetic feature. We demonstrate the first example of direct and selective chemical oxidation of 5mC to 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) in DNA, employing a photocatalytic system. This transformation was used to selectively tag 5mC. We also provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for deploying this chemistry for single&#8208;base resolution sequencing of 5mC and genetic bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) in DNA on a next&#8208;generation sequencing system. This work exemplifies how photocatalysis has the potential to transform the analysis of DNA.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Tandem Photocatalytic Methanation of CO2 by Lacunary Polyoxometalates&#8208;Stabilized *CO Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x=9,11,12) with g&#8208;C3N4 tailors the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 with high yield and selectivity. As the lacuna increases, PWx acquires less photogenerated electrons to capture and activate *CO, leading to higher CH4 yield and selectivity. PW9/g&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a superior CH4 selectivity of 80&#8201;% and an outstanding evolution rate of 40.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g&#8208;C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x=12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80&#8201;% and 40.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 evolution rate for PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. Conversely, g&#8208;C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process. CO2 is initially activated on g&#8208;C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g&#8208;C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO. However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g&#8208;C3N4 (x=12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.

         <title>The Photodynamic Agent Designed by Involvement of Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Enhancing Photodynamic Therapy</title>

We report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers (PSs) involving hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to enhance photodynamic therapy. As proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;based Type&#8208;I PS was developed, which produces carbon&#8208;centered radicals to oxidize NADH and generates superoxide radicals under light&#8208;irradiation. This PS exhibits strong photocytotoxicity under hypoxic conditions and excellent in vivo antitumor efficacy in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Although Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy has attracted increasingly growing interest due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, the design of effective Type&#8208;I photosensitizers remains a challenge. In this work, we report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by the involvement of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). As a proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;involved Type&#8208;I PS, which simultaneously generates superoxide and carbon&#8208;centered radicals under light&#8208;irradiation, was synthesized. This photosensitizer is comprised of a fluorene&#8208;substituted BODIPY unit as an electron acceptor covalently linked with a triphenylamine moiety as an electron donor. Under light&#8208;irradiation, photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer occurs to generate the BODIPY anion radical and triphenylamine cation radical. The former transfers electrons to oxygen to generate O2&#8722;&#8901;, while the latter loses a proton to produce a benzyl carbon&#8208;centered radical which is well characterized. The resulting carbon&#8208;centered radicals efficiently oxidize NADH by HAT reaction. This photosensitizer demonstrates remarkable photocytotoxicity even under hypoxic conditions, along with outstanding in vivo antitumor efficacy in mouse models bearing HeLa tumors. This work offers a novel strategy for the design of Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by involvement of HAT.

The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges. Here, we described a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to solve the enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. Examples of asymmetrical dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3+2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H coupling reactions with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities demonstrated the great success of this strategy.







Abstract
The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges, despite a few successful examples. We introduce a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to address enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in two reactions: an asymmetric dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3+2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling. These reactions have enabled the synthesis of benzofuroindolines and C&#8722;N axially chiral indoles with high yields and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed a radical&#8208;radical coupling mechanism. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the indole radical cation as the pivotal intermediate, rather than a neutral indolyl radical, shedding new light on the underlying processes driving these reactions.

         <title>Nonconventional Fluorescent Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams for Multipurpose Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isocyanate&#8208;free polyurethane foams prepared by the facile, upscalable water&#8208;induced self&#8208;foaming technology present a nonconventional fluorescent behaviour with a multicolor emission. This clusteroluminescence is exploited for sensing and quantifying gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+) and antibiotics.







Abstract
Fluorescent foams with interconnected pores are attractive for the detection and quantification of various products. However, many fluorescent probes are suffering from aggregation&#8208;caused fluorescence quenching in their solid/aggregated state, are costly, and/or not straightforward to incorporate in foams, limiting their utility for this application. Herein, non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams, prepared by the simple water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blowing process, present a nonconventional fluorescence behaviour, i.e. they are intrinsically fluorescent with a multicolor emission without requiring ex situ traditional fluorescent probes. These foams demonstrate utility for capturing&#8208;sensing gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), as well as for detecting and quantifying various metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+). They are also able to selectively sense tetracycline antibiotic in a ratiometric way with a high sensitivity. By exploiting the unique multicolor photoluminescent foam properties, a smartphone&#8208;compatible device is used for the facile antibiotic quantification. This nonconventional fluorescence behaviour is discussed experimentally and theoretically, and is mainly based on clusteroluminescence originating from multiple hydrogen bonding and hetero&#8208;atomic sub&#8208;luminophores, thus from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens that are naturally present in the foams. This work illustrates that easily accessible non&#8208;conventional fluorescent NIPU foams characterized by a modular emission wavelength have an enormous potential for multiple substrates detection and quantification.

         <title>Electronic Response and Charge Inversion at Polarized Gold Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new first&#8208;principles&#8208;based simulation method to model the electrified metal&#8208;electrolyte interface has been developed and applied to both Au(100) and Au(111) surfaces in NaCl solution. It reveals that the electronic response of Au electrode contributes significantly to the experimental reported high capacitance and the unexpected instantaneous adsorption of Cl ions at anodic polarized Au (100) (instead at PZC) can lead to a charge inversion.







Abstract
We have studied polarized Au(100) and Au(111) electrodes immersed in electrolyte solution by implementing finite&#8208;field methods in density functional theory&#8208;based molecular dynamics simulations. This allows us to directly compute the Helmholtz capacitance of electric double layer by including both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom, and the results turn out to be in excellent agreement with experiments. It is found that the electronic response of Au electrode makes a crucial contribution to the high Helmholtz capacitance and the instantaneous adsorption of Cl can lead to a charge inversion on the anodic polarized Au(100) surface. These findings point out ways to improve popular semi&#8208;classical models for simulating electrified solid&#8211;liquid interfaces and to identify the nature of surface charges therein which are difficult to access in experiments.

         <title>Intermolecular Anionic Mixed&#8208;Valence and &#960;&#8208;Dimer Complexes of ortho&#8208;Pentannulated Bisazacoronene Diimide</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reduction of ortho&#8208;pentannulated bisazacoronene diimides in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent has led to the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.







Abstract
This study reports the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) and &#960;&#8208;dimer species in ortho&#8208;pentannulated BisAzaCoroneneDiimides (BACDs) during their electrochemical reduction in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent. A library of nitrogen&#8208;containing extended PDIs was synthesized via an aza&#8208;benzannulation reaction followed by a Pd&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;pentannulation reaction. Ortho&#8208;pentannulated BACDs revealed strong aggregation abilities in solution. Concentration&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption spectra, variable temperature 1H NMR experiments, and atomic force microscopy coupled to molecular dynamics support their self&#8208;assembly into columnar aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in dichloromethane reveal prominent splitting of the first reduction wave, attributed to the formation of unprecedented intermolecular anionic MV and &#960;&#8208;dimers in organic solvent. These species were thoroughly characterized by real&#8208;time spectroelectrochemistry, electrochemical simulations and theoretical calculations. Remarkably, this work underscores the tuneable nature of AzaBenzannulatedPerylene Diimides (AzaBPDIs) and BACDs, emphasizing their potential as a promising scaffold for designing supramolecular materials with long&#8208;range radical anion delocalization. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Polymeric Nanoribbons in Water Driven by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Diving into the nanoscale! We present a simple method to obtain polymeric nanoribbons in water using a tailored perylene diimide as a supramolecular structure directing unit. We study their formation over time and their temperature sensitivity.







Abstract
A simple method was developed to produce polymeric nanoribbons and other nanostructures in water. This approach incorporates a perylene diimide (PDI) functionalized by triethylene glycol (TEG) as a hydrophobic supramolecular structure directing unit (SSDU) into the core of hydrophilic poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAc) chains using RAFT polymerization. All PDI&#8208;functional polymers dissolved spontaneously in water, forming different nanostructures depending on the degree of polymerization (DPn): nanoribbons and nanocylinders for DPn=14 and 22, and spheres for DPn&gt;50 as determined by cryo&#8208;TEM and SAXS analyses. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor the evolution of the PDI absorption signal upon dissolution. In solid form, all polymers show a H&#8208;aggregate absorption signature, but upon dissolution in water, the shortest DPn forming nanoribbons evolved to show HJ&#8208;aggregate absorption signals. Over time, the J&#8208;aggregate band increased in intensity, while cryo&#8208;TEM monitoring evidenced an increase in the nanoribbon's width. Heating the nanoribbons above 60&#8201;&#176;C, triggered a morphological transition from nanoribbons to nanocylinders, due to the disappearance of J&#8208;aggregates, while H&#8208;aggregates were maintained. The study shows that the TEG&#8208;PDI is a powerful SSDU to promote 2D or 1D self&#8208;assembly of polymers depending on DPn through simple dissolution in water.

&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; forming nanoribbons evolved to show HJ-aggregate absorption signals. Over time, the J-aggregate band increased in intensity, while cryo-TEM monitoring evidenced an increase in the nanoribbon's width. Heating the nanoribbons above 60&#8201;&#176;C, triggered a morphological transition from nanoribbons to nanocylinders, due to the disappearance of J-aggregates, while H-aggregates were maintained. The study shows that the TEG-PDI is a powerful SSDU to promote 2D or 1D self-assembly of polymers depending on &lt;i&gt;DP&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; through simple dissolution in water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Controlled Hybridization, Chiral Induction and Handedness of Helical Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the single or multiple helical state as well as the chirality of helical foldamers is currently in the limelight. In this context, this work demonstrates to which extent grafting a photo&#8208;responsive unidirectional motor on foldamer skeletons is relevant to tackle these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this work constitutes the first example of photoswitchable handedness of foldamer&#8208;based double helices.







Abstract
Helical foldamers have attracted much attention over the last decades given their resemblance to certain biomacromolecules and their potential in domains as different as pharmaceutics, catalysis and photonics. Various research groups have successfully controlled the right&#8208; or left&#8208; handedness of these oligomers by introducing stereogenic centers through covalent or non&#8208;covalent chemistry. However, developing helical structures whose handedness can be reversibly switched remains a major challenge for chemists. To date, such an achievement has been reported with light&#8208;responsive single&#8208;stranded foldamers only. Herein, we demonstrate that grafting a unidirectional motor onto foldamer strands constitutes a relevant strategy to i) control the single or double helical state of a foldamer, ii) switch on the chiral induction process from the motor to the helical strands and iii) select the handedness of double helical structures through photochemical and thermal stimulations.

         <title>Molecular Photoswitching Unlocks Glucose Oxidase for Synergistically Reinforcing Fenton Reactions for Antitumor Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe(III)&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based nanoparticles capable of generating strong oxidative stress for eradicating tumors with spatial precision is developed based on the phototriggered cascade enzymatic reaction&#8208;Fenton reaction. The photoswitching of spiropyran (SP) unlocks the enzymatic activity of glucose oxidase (GOx) and light triggers Fe(III)&#8208;to&#8208;Fe(II) photoreduction, which jointly reinforce Fenton reactions by providing the triple enabling factors therein.







Abstract
We have developed a new type of nanoparticles with potent antitumor activity photoactivatable via the combination of molecular photoswitching of spiropyran (SP) and enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase (GOx). As two key processes involved therein, Fe(III)&#8208;to&#8208;Fe(II) photoreduction in Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) brings about the release of free Fe2+/Fe3+ while the photoswitching of SP to merocyanine (MC) unlocks the enzymatic activity of GOx that was pre&#8208;passivated by SP. The release of free Fe3+ boosts its hydrolysis and therefore enables the acidification of microenvironment, which is further reinforced by one of the products of the GOx&#8208;mediated glucose oxidation reaction, gluconic acid (GlcA). Based on the generation of Fe2+ and acidic milieu together with another product of the oxidation reaction, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), these two processes jointly present triple enabling factors for generating lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) species via Fenton reactions and therefore oxidative stress capable of inhibiting tumor. The antitumor potency of such nanoparticle is verified in tumor&#8208;bearing model mice in vivo, proclaiming its potential as a potent and safe agent based on the unique mechanism of optically manipulating enzyme activity for synergistic antitumor therapeutics with high spatial precision, enhanced efficacy and minimized side effects.

         <title>Selective Activation of Peptide&#8208;Thioester Precursors for Templated Native Chemical Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A traceless multi&#8208;segment templated native chemical ligation (NCL) method is described. Undesired cross&#8208;ligation and cyclization are minimized by selective activation of peptide&#8208;thioester precursors and sequential peptide conjugations. This one&#8208;pot approach, Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN), is anticipated to expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins that are difficult to access using traditional intramolecular NCL.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis enables access to proteins that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional means such as recombinant expression. Chemoselective ligations provide the ability to join peptide segments prepared by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. While native chemical ligation (NCL) is widely used, it is limited by the need for C&#8208;terminal thioesters with suitable reaction kinetics, properly placed native Cys or thiolated derivatives, and peptide segment solubility at low mM concentrations. Moreover, repetitive purifications to isolate ligated products are often yield&#8208;sapping, hampering efficiency and progress. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN). This traceless multi&#8208;segment templated NCL approach permits the one&#8208;pot synthesis of proteins by harnessing selective thioester activation and orthogonal conjugation chemistries to favor formation of the full&#8208;length ligated product while minimizing side reactions. Importantly, CAPTN provides kinetic enhancements allowing ligations at sterically hindered junctions and low peptide concentrations. Additionally, this one&#8208;pot approach removes the need for intermediate purification. We report the synthesis of two E. coli ribosomal subunits S16 and S17 enabled by the chemical tools described herein. We anticipate that CAPTN will expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins and expand on templated approaches for chemical protein synthesis.

         <title>Promotion of RNF168&#8208;Mediated Nucleosomal H2A Ubiquitylation by Structurally Defined K63&#8208;Polyubiquitylated Linker Histone H1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy termed CAEPL (Cysteine Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation) was developed to prepare K63&#8208;polyubiquitylated linker histone H1, which was used to investigate the PTM crosstalk between H1 ubiquitylation and H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168. It was revealed that K63&#8208;polyubiquitylated H1 can directly promote RNF168 ubiquitylation activity towards H2A by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and the chromatosome.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of histones with homogeneous modifications is a powerful approach for quantitatively deciphering the functional crosstalk between different post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). In this study, we developed an expedient site&#8208;specific (poly)ubiquitylation strategy (CAEPL, Cysteine Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation), which integrates the Cys&#8208;aminoethylation reaction with the process of ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzyme UBA1&#8208;assisted native chemical ligation. Using this strategy, we successfully prepared monoubiquitylated and K63&#8208;linked di&#8208; and tri&#8208;ubiquitylated linker histone H1.0 proteins, which were incorporated into individual chromatosomes. Quantitative biochemical analysis of different RNF168 constructs on H1 ubiquitylated chromatosomes with different ubiquitin chain lengths demonstrated that K63&#8208;linked polyubiquitylated H1.0 could directly stimulate RNF168 ubiquitylation activity by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and the chromatosome. Subsequent cryo&#8208;EM structural analysis of the RNF168/UbcH5c&#8211;Ub/H1.0&#8208;K63&#8208;Ub3 chromatosome complex revealed the potential recruitment orientation between RNF168 UDM1 domain and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain on H1.0. Finally, we explored the impact of H1.0 ubiquitylation on RNF168 activity in the context of asymmetric H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 di&#8208;nucleosome substrate, revealing a comparable stimulation effect of both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;nucleosomal crosstalk. Overall, our study highlights the significance of access to structurally defined polyubiquitylated H1.0 by the CAEPL strategy, enabling in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations of in&#8208;trans PTM crosstalk between linker histone H1.0 and core histone H2A ubiquitylation.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Modulated Short&#8208;Chain Cathode for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;chain molecule cathode is designed by modulating local entropy to enhance low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;S batteries (ASSLSBs). The shortened reaction pathways and mismatched lithiation lattice enhance the reaction kinetics and low&#8208;temperature charge/discharge reversibility. Thus, the designed short&#8208;chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4&#8201;%) and excellent low&#8208;temperature reversible capacity (579.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;S batteries (ASSLSBs) due to high theoretical energy density and exceptional safety are highly desirable for electric aircraft. However, as the flight altitude rises, the low&#8208;temperature performance is hampered by inadequate practical capacity. Here, we discover that low&#8208;temperature sulfur utilization is constrained by the multi&#8208;step endothermic conversion reaction. By introducing multi&#8208;chalcogen to modulate the local entropy, a short&#8208;chain molecule cathode is designed to shorten the reduction pathways and enhance low&#8208;temperature discharge capacity. Furthermore, the mismatched lithiation lattice of the short&#8208;chain cathode reduces the decomposition energy barriers, thus enhancing low&#8208;temperature charge/discharge reversibility. The designed short&#8208;chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4&#8201;%) and cycling stability (400 cycles, 92.2&#8201;% retention) at room temperature, as well as delivers excellent discharge capacity (579.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C) and cycling performance (100 cycles, 98.4&#8201;% retention, 394.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1electrode, &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) at low temperature. This study presents new opportunities to stimulate the development of low&#8208;temperature ASSLSBs.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes a machine learning&#8208;guided approach with fused features to discover superior copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators, achieving a determination coefficient of 0.88. Copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, discovered through this method exhibits radioluminescence that is 56 times higher than PbWO4. It enables detection limits of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 in X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating significant potential for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable band gaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Molecular Evidence for the Axial Coordination Effect of Atomic Iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 Sites in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in oxygen reduction reaction is deciphered at the molecular scale. The electronic structure of the 3d orbital of Fe centers and the binding of the reactant/intermediate species on active sites are modulated exquisitely by the adequate interactions between Fe&#8208;N4 moiety and axial iodine, which is determined as an important factor for the improved performance.







Abstract
We present a molecular&#8208;scale investigation of the axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM). A well&#8208;defined model catalytic system with explicit and uniform iodine&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N4 sites was constructed facilely by the self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) on an I&#8208;modified Au(111) surface. The electrocatalytic activity of FePc for the ORR shows notable enhancement with axial iodine ligands. The modulation of the electronic structure of Fe sites to evoke a higher spin configuration by axial iodine was evidenced. The interaction strength between oxygen&#8208;containing species and active centers becomes weaker due to the presence of iodine ligands, and the reaction is thermodynamically preferable. Furthermore, the reaction dynamics of FePc on I/Au(111) were explicitly determined via in situ ECSTM potential pulse experiments. In contrast, axial atomic iodine was found inefficacious for improving the activity of Co&#8208;N4 sites, and electron rearrangement was found to be marginal, demonstrating that adequate interactions between axial ligands and metal sites for optimizing electronic structures and catalytic behaviors are prerequisites for the impactful role of axial ligands.

         <title>Construction of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks Through a Linker Decomposition Chiral Induction Strategy for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker decomposition chiral induction (LDCI) strategy was developed to construct chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Even with fully decomposed chiral linkers, the homochirality of the COFs were well preserved. The integrated chiral COF&#8208;based photodetectors showed promising recognition performances toward circularly polarized light detection.







Abstract
Exploring new strategies for construction of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount importance yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of chiral COFs through a linker decomposition chiral induction (LDCI) strategy. Three pairs of azine&#8208;linked chiral COFs are successfully synthesized by the condensation reactions of C3&#8208;symmetric 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz) with flexible chiral dihydrazide linkers derived from malic acid, aspartic acid and tartaric acid, respectively. Remarkably, upon complete or partial decomposition from flexible chiral dihydrazides to hydrazine during COF synthesis, the homochirality of these COFs, originating from the single&#8208;handedness conformation of propeller&#8208;like Tz cores, is well preserved. Such a stereoselective chiral memory realized via the LDCI strategy is confirmed by time&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) and diffuse reflectance circular dichroism (DRCD). Moreover, the resultant azine&#8208;linked chiral COFs are used as the active materials to fabricate photodetectors to directly distinguish circularly polarized light (CPL), showing impressive recognition performances on the identification of left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized lights. Notably, the residual undecomposed flexible chiral linkers within the COFs are found to be conducive to improving the polarization discrimination ratio. This work highlights LDCI as a new and effective strategy for constructing homochiral COFs with promising future in chiral optical application.

This work highlights LDCI as a new and effective strategy for constructing homochiral COFs with promising future in chiral optical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 Over 800&#8197;Hours</title>

An efficient anion exchange membrane (AEM) and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer enable an AEM water electrolysizer (AEMWE) to operate at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.3&#8197;V. The optimized AEMWE demonstrates an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over a benchmark.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology for green hydrogen production. Although the normal current densities of AEMWEs are below 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operating them at higher current densities represents an efficient, but little&#8208;explored approach to decrease the total cost of hydrogen production. We show here that a benchmark AEMWE has an operational lifetime of only seconds at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By using a more conductive and robust AEM, and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer, we have developed AEMWEs that stably operate at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with extended lifetimes. The optimized AEMWE has an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over the current benchmark. The cell voltage is only 2.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, comparable to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices operating at current densities lower than 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.

         <title>Oriented Titanium&#8208;MOF Membrane for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise orientation control, b&#8208;oriented MIP&#8208;177&#8208;LT membranes exhibit superior performances towards hydrogen purification relying on the 0.3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate. At the same time, due to the synergistic effect of 1&#8197;nm&#8208;sized MOF channel, this spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability.







Abstract
Precise hydrogen sorting from purge gas (H2/N2) and coke gas (H2/CH4), commonly carried out by cryogenic distillation, still suffers from low separation efficiency, high energy consumption, and considerable capital cost. Though still in its infancy, membrane technology offers a potential to achieve more efficient hydrogen purification. In this study, an optimum separation of hydrogen towards both methane and nitrogen via a kinetically&#8208;driven mechanism is realized through preferred orientation control of a MOF membrane. Relying on the 0.3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate, b&#8208;oriented Ti&#8208;MOF membrane exhibits ultra&#8208;high hydrogen selectivity, surpassing the upper bound limit of separating H2/N2 and H2/CH4 gas pairs attained so far by inorganic membranes. This spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability owing to the synergistic effect of the 1&#8197;nm&#8208;sized MOF channel.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Skeletal Rearrangement of Non&#8208;Biased Alkyl Cyclopropanes/Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions represent a powerful strategy to access a diverse array of chemical scaffolds. The direct activation of alkyl non&#8208;biased cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes through electrochemical oxidation facilitates the formation of a wide range of oxazoline and oxazine derivatives, offering crucial insights into the oxidation of small cycloalkane rings.







Abstract
Capitalizing the inherent strain energy within molecules, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions have been widely employed in organic synthesis. Small cycloalkanes like cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, with their moderate ring strain, typically require dense functionalization to induce bias or distal activation of (hetero) aromatic rings via single&#8208;electron oxidation for relieving the tension. In this study, we present a pioneering direct activation of alkyl cyclopropanes/butanes through electrochemical oxidation. This approach not only showcases the potential for ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane/butane under electrochemical conditions but also streamlines the synthesis of diverse oxazolines and oxazines. The applicability of our method is exemplified by its broad substrate scopes. Notably, the products derived from cyclobutanes undergo a formal ring contraction to cyclopropanes, introducing an intriguing aspect to our discoveries. These discoveries mark a significant advancement in strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven skeletal rearrangement reactions of moderately strained rings, offering sustainable and efficient synthetic pathways for future endeavours.

         <title>MXene Triggered Free Radical Polymerization in Minutes Toward All&#8208;Printed Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, scalable, fast yet controllable polymerization approach to quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes enabled by the unique MXene triggering chemistry is proposed. The seamless electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface originated from the thorough infiltration of low&#8208;viscosity precursors in the electrode percolative network, followed by the rapid polymerization, allows all&#8208;printing of energy storage devices beyond zinc&#8208;in hybrid capacitors.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing of (quasi&#8722;) solid&#8208;state (QSS) electrochemical energy storage devices (EES) highlights the significance of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) design. Creating well&#8208;bonded electrode&#8208;GPEs interfaces in the electrode percolative network via printing leads to large&#8208;scale production of customized EES with boosted electrochemical performance but has proven to be quite challenging. Herein, we report on a versatile, universal and scalable approach to engineer a controllable, seamless electrode&#8208;GPEs interface via free radical polymerization (FRP) triggered by MXene at room temperature. Importantly, MXene reduces the dissociation enthalpy of persulfate initiators and significantly shortens the induction period accelerated by SO4&#8722;, enabling the completion of FRP within minutes. The as&#8208;formed well&#8208;bonded electrode&#8208;GPEs interface homogenizes the electrical and concentration fields (i.e., Zn2+), therefore suppressing the dendrites formation, which translates to long&#8208;term cycling (50,000&#8197;times), high energy density (105.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (9231&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1) coupled with excellent stability upon deformation in the zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZHCs). Moreover, the critical switch of the rheological behaviours of the polymer electrolyte (as aqueous inks in still state and become solids once triggered by MXene) perfectly ensures the direct all&#8208;printing of electrodes and GPEs with well&#8208;bonded interface in between, opening vast possibilities for all&#8208;printed QSS EES beyond ZHCs.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dot Photoresist for Direct Photolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is proposed for the direct synthesis of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresist, where the isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) acts as both the solution for the synthesis and dispersion of PQDs and the monomer resin for PQDs photoresist. The application of the PQDs photoresist in direct photolithography is confirmed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresists are promising building blocks for photolithographically patterned devices. However, their complex synthesis and combination processes limit their optical properties and potential patterning applications. Here, we present an exceptionally simple strategy for the synthesis of PQDs photoresist. Unlike traditional approaches that involve centrifugation, separation, and combination processes, our direct synthesis technique using polymerizable acrylic monomer as solvent to fabricate PQDs photoresists without complex post&#8208;synthesis process. We demonstrate that the change in solubility of the precursors is the main reason for the formation of PQDs in the polymerizable monomer. By direct photolithography, colorful PQD patterns with high photoluminescence quantum yields and high thickness are successfully demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of PQDs photoresist, expanding their applications in various integrated applications, such as photonic, energy harvesting, and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Amplification and Attenuation of Asymmetry via Kinetically Controlled Seed&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we introduce a novel strategy to both amplify and attenuate asymmetry in supramolecular assemblies using a seed&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization strategy under kinetic conditions&#8212;an unprecedented observation in the field.







Abstract
The amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymers has recently garnered significant attention. While asymmetry amplification has predominantly been explored under thermodynamic conditions, the kinetic aspect of this process unveils intriguing observations, yet is scarcely reported in the literature. Herein, drawing inspiration from macromolecular systems, we propose a novel strategy for enhancing asymmetry in supramolecular polymers through a seed&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization approach under kinetic conditions, employing a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) for template&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, utilizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) as templates. A chiral seed comprising [ANSG&#8208;ATP]S effectively amplifies the overall supramolecular asymmetry when exposed to a mixture of achiral templates (PPi) and monomers (ANSG), owing to its efficient seeding characteristics under kinetic conditions. As a result of efficient co&#8208;operativity, conversely, employing an achiral seed [ANSG&#8208;PPi]S in a mixture of chiral templates (ATP) and monomers (ANSG) results in the attenuation of asymmetry, highlighting the effective modulation achievable through the seeding approach, an unprecedented observation in the field. Exploiting the efficient aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of the resultant supramolecular polymers further extends the amplification and attenuation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) as a potential function.

         <title>Rational Design of Diatomic Active Sites for Elucidating Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance Trends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteronuclear transition&#8208;noble metal DAC (MT&#8208;MN DAC) was synthesized from macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy, of which the OER performance followed in the order of Cu&#8722;MN&lt;Mn&#8722;MN&lt;Fe&#8722;MN&lt;MN&lt;Co&#8722;MN&lt;Ni&#8722;MN. The effect of the MT atoms on the OER performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates, and the &#916;G*OOH&#8211;&#916;G*OH could be used as the effective performance descriptor.







Abstract
Diatomic catalysts, especially those with heteronuclear active sites, have recently attracted significant attention for their advantages over single&#8208;atom catalysts in reactions with relatively high energy barrier, e.g. oxygen evolution reaction. Rational design and synthesis of heteronuclear diatomic catalysts are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy to fabricate series of transition metal (MT, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, or Cu)&#8208;noble (MN, Ir or Ru) centers in carbon material. One notable performance trend is observed in the order of Cu&#8722;MN&lt;Mn&#8722;MN&lt;Fe&#8722;MN&lt;MN&lt;Co&#8722;MN&lt;Ni&#8722;MN. Meanwhile, the pathway has been not altered, still following the traditional adsorption reaction mechanism. The effect of the MT atoms on the performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates (i.e. *OH, *O and/or *OOH), strongly implying that &#916;G*OOH&#8211;&#916;G*OH could be used as the performance descriptor. We believe that our work provides useful strategy for synthesis of diatomic active sites with sole coordination configuration and varied composition, and in&#8208;depth insight to their catalytic mechanism, which could be used for further optimization of diatomic catalysts towards oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Synergize Strong and Reactive Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Construct Sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm Metal Phosphide Cluster for Enhanced Selective Hydrogenation Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SMSI and RMSI mechanisms are harmoniously integrated to achieve simultaneously stabilize and optimize sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm sites. Owning to the adaptive coordination and electronic structure optimization triggered by the two kinds of MSIs, the obtained Ni2Pn site possessed optimal substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics and thus greatly enhancing catalytic performance towards the selective hydrogenations.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) are crucial for stabilizing sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm metal sites, e.g. single atom (M1) or cluster (Mn). However, further optimizing sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm sites to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off due to excessive interactions remains significant challenges. Accordingly, for the first time, we propose synergizing SMSI with reactive metal&#8208;support interactions (RMSI). Comprehensive characterization confirms that the SMSI stabilizes the metal and regulates the aggregation of Ni1 into Nin site within sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm. Meanwhile, RMSI modulates Nin through sufficiently activating P in the support and eventually generates sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm metal phosphide Ni2P cluster (Ni2Pn). The synergetic metal&#8208;support interactions triggered the adaptive coordination and electronic structure optimization of Ni2Pn, leading to the desired substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics. Consequently, the activity of Ni2Pn site greatly enhanced towards the selective hydrogenations of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene and alkynyl alcohol. The formation rates of target products are up to 20.2 and 3.0&#8197;times greater than that of Ni1 and Nin site, respectively. This work may open a new direction for metal&#8208;support interactions and promote innovation and application of active sites below 2&#8197;nm.

         <title>Manganese Carbodiimide (MnNCN): A New Heterogeneous Mn Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of Nitriles from Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MnNCN nanoparticles were first discovered to be robust for the ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles, while the extensively studied MnOx produced amides under identical conditions. Besides the high activity and selectivity, MnNCN demonstrated wide substrate scope including primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols, as well as diols.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant manganese oxides (MnOx) were competitive candidates when screening catalysts for ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles due to their redox property. However, over&#8208;oxidation and possible acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles into amides still limited the application of MnOx in nitrile synthesis. In this work, manganese carbodiimide (MnNCN) was first reported to be robust for the ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and the hydrolysis. Besides the high activity and selectivity, MnNCN demonstrated wide substrate scope including the ammoxidation of primary alcohols into nitriles, the oxidative C&#8722;C bonds cleavage and ammoxidation of secondary alcohols, phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols, and diols into nitriles. Controlled experiments and DFT calculation results revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of MnNCN originated from its high ability in the activation of O2 molecules, and favorable oxidative dehydrogenation of C=N bonds in the aldimine intermediates (RCH=NH) into nitriles, inhibiting the competitive side reaction of the oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acids, followed to amide byproducts. Moreover, the hydrolysis of nitriles was also inhibited over MnNCN for its weak acidity as compared with MnOx. This study provided new insights into Mn&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidations as a highly important complement to manganese oxides.

         <title>Integrating Molecular Motions in Ternary Cocrystals for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ternary cocrystal composed of tetracyanoquinodimethane as an electron acceptor, triphenylene as an electron acceptor, and pyrene, the latter exhibits rotational motion, resulting in enhanced photothermal ability in the NIR&#8208;II window. The molecular motions are characterized directly by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography. Pyrene also functions as a blocker to protect the organic radical from quenchers such as oxygen and water molecules.







Abstract
Organic photothermal conversion materials hold immense promise for various applications owing to their structural flexibility. Recent research has focused on enhancing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and mitigating radiative transition processes. In this study, we have developed a viable approach to the design of photothermal conversion materials through the construction of ternary organic cocrystals, by introducing a third component as a molecular blocker and motion unit into a binary donor&#8211;acceptor system. Superstructural and photophysical properties of the ternary cocrystals were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The role of the molecular blocker in radical stabilization and photothermal conversion was demonstrated. Intriguingly, the motions of the entire pyrene molecules in the cocrystal have been observed by the results of variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The excellent performance of the ternary cocrystal as a photothermal material was validated through efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiments. The efficiency of water evaporation reached 88.7&#8201;%, with a corresponding evaporation rate of 1.29&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing excellent performance among pure organic small molecular photothermal conversion materials. Our research underscores the introduction of molecular blockers and motion units to stabilize radicals and produce outstanding photothermal conversion materials, offering new pathways for developing efficient and stable photothermal conversion materials.

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Switchable Peptide Fibril Esterase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selection of a photo&#8208;switchable amphiphilic peptide catalyst is achieved by screening a small library of isomeric peptides containing light responsive and catalytic groups. The selected peptide shows efficient and enantioselective esterase&#8208;like activity that can be multiple times manipulated by light.







Abstract
Recent attempts to mimic enzyme catalysis using simple, short peptides have been successful in enhancing various reactions, but the on&#8208;demand, temporal or spatial regulation of such processes by external triggers remains a great challenge. Light irradiation is an ideal trigger for regulating molecular functionality, since it can be precisely manipulated in time and space, and because most reaction mediums do not react to light. We herein report the selection of a photo&#8208;switchable amphiphilic peptide catalyst from a small library of isomeric peptides, each containing an azobenzene&#8208;based light responsive group and a catalytic histidine residue. In its native fibrillar form, the selected peptide is efficiently and enantio&#8208;selectively active for ester hydrolysis, but after irradiation by UV light inducing trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis azobenzene isomerization, the fibrils disassemble to amorphous aggregates that are much less catalytically active. Significantly, this esterase&#8208;like activity can be manipulated multiple times, as the fibrillar peptide assembly is reversibly reduced and restored upon alternate irradiation by UV and visible light, respectively. We propose that this research may shine light on the origin of complex functions in early chemical evolution. Furthermore, it paves the way to regulate additional functions for peptide nanotechnology, such as replication, charge transfer, and delivery.

         <dc:description>
Using the low boiling point of Zn, a single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy alloy with hierarchical pore structure was obtained by high&#8208;temperature calcination of Zn&#8208;rich precursors. The volatilization of Zn was proven to be crucial for achieving the mesoporous structure and preventing metal agglomeration. This material exhibits high electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction and can be applied in zinc&#8208;air batteries. The research approach and preparation method can be extended to the production of more high&#8208;entropy alloys and various application fields.







Abstract
The active sites of inexpensive transition metal electrocatalysts are sparse and singular, thus high&#8208;entropy alloys composed of non&#8208;precious metals have attracted considerable attention due to their multi&#8208;component synergistic effects. However, the facile synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy composites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a &#8220;one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;birds&#8221; method utilizing zinc (Zn)&#8208;rich metal&#8211;organic frameworks as precursors, by virtue of the low boiling point of Zn (907&#8201;&#176;C) and its high volatility in alloys, high&#8208;entropy alloy carbon nanocomposite with a layered pore structure was ultimately synthesized. The experimental results demonstrate that the volatilization of zinc can prevent metal agglomeration and contribute to the formation of uniformly dispersed high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles at slower pyrolysis and cooling rates. Simultaneously, the volatilization of Zn plays a crucial role in creating the hierarchically porous structure. Compared to the zinc&#8208;free HEA/NC&#8208;1, the HEA/NC&#8208;5 derived from the precursor containing 0.8 Zn exhibit massive micropores and mesopores. The resulting nanocomposites represent a synergistic effect between highly dispersed metal catalytic centers and hierarchical adsorption sites, thus achieving excellent electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance with low catalyst loading compared to commercial Pt/C. This convenient zinc&#8208;rich precursor method can be extended to the production of more high&#8208;entropy alloys and various application fields.

         <title>Single&#8208;Luminophore Molecular Engineering for Rapidly Phototunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering strategy for rapidly photoregulatable solid&#8208;state luminescence was developed. The key factors of the strategy emphasize the enhanced conformational freedom by the isolated arrangement of ionic persulfurated arenes assisted by weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, as well as the facilitated photoexcitation&#8208;induced conformational change of persulfurated arenes.







Abstract
Smart materials enabling emission intensity or wavelength tuning by light stimulus have attracted attention in cutting&#8208;edge fields. However, due to the general limitation of the dense molecular stacking (in solid states, especially in crystals) on photoresponsivity, constructing rapidly phototunable solid&#8208;state luminescent systems remains challenging. Herein, we present a new luminophore that serves as both a photoresponsive and a luminous group with enhanced conformational freedom to attain this goal, namely, relying on photoexcitation&#8208;induced molecular conformational change of an ionized persulfurated arene based on weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Together with the phosphorescence characteristic of the molecule itself, rapidly enhanced phosphorescence upon irradiation can be observed in a series of phase states, like solution state, crystal, and amorphous state, especially with a high photoresponsive rate of 0.033&#8197;s&#8722;1 in crystal state that is superior to the relevant reported cases. Moreover, a rapidly phototunable afterglow effect is achieved by extending this molecule into some polymer&#8208;based doping systems, endowing the system with unique dynamic imaging and fast photopatterning capabilities. This single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering and underlying mechanism have implications for building other condensed functional materials, principally for those with stimuli responses in solid states.

&lt;p&gt;A single-luminophore molecular engineering strategy for rapidly photoregulatable solid-state luminescence was developed. The key factors of the strategy emphasize the enhanced conformational freedom by the isolated arrangement of ionic persulfurated arenes assisted by weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, as well as the facilitated photoexcitation-induced conformational change of persulfurated arenes.

         <title>Mesostructure&#8208;Specific Configuration of *CO Adsorption for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic ordered CuO mesostructures, specifically mesoporous m&#8208;CuO and cylindrical c&#8208;CuO, were rationally designed by templated routes, which exhibited favored adsorption for *CObridge and *COtop intermediates, respectively. Remarkably, the preferred *CObridge adsorption on the m&#8208;CuO catalyst promoted the selective generation of C2+ alcohols, whereas the *COtop intermediate on the c&#8208;CuO catalysts accelerated CO2 electroreduction to C2H4.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C&#8722;C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m&#8208;CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c&#8208;CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m&#8208;CuO and c&#8208;CuO show similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (&#8805;76&#8201;%), but the corresponding predominant products are C2+ alcohols (55&#8201;%) and C2H4 (52&#8201;%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induces the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailors the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m&#8208;CuO prefers bridged adsorption, whereas c&#8208;CuO favors top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unravel that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo conventional C&#8722;C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves a new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.

         <title>Loading Lewis Acid/Base Pair on Metal Nanocluster for Catalytic Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal nanocluster Au35Cd2(PNP)(SAdm)18Cl with both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites has been synthesized and characterized. It was developed as an efficient catalyst for the Ugi reaction, exhibiting high TOF, mild conditions, broad substrate scope and exceptional catalyst recyclability. Synergistic effect of the Lewis acid/Lewis base pair on the metal nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high catalytic activity.







Abstract
Constructing structurally robust and catalytically active metal nanoclusters for catalyzing multi&#8208;component reactions is an interesting while challenging task. Inspired by Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysis, we realized the combination of both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites on the surface of a stable gold nanocluster Au35Cd2. The catalytic potential of Au35Cd2 in four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was explored, demonstrating high activity and exceptional recyclability. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies indicate that the catalytic synergy of the Lewis acid/base pair is crucial for the high efficiency of Au35Cd2&#8208;catalyzed Ugi reaction. Bearing the stable structure, multiple activation sites and hierarchical chirality, Au35Cd2 is expected to display further interesting catalytic performance such as asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Perfect Is Perfect: Nickel Prussian Blue Analogue as A High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

         <dc:description>
A general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is developed for the synthesis of unusual NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructures as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208;ORR electrocatalyst. The perfect stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water and {210} dominated facet exposure of NiNi&#8208;PBA collaborately lead to a high 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity of 100&#8201;% and H2O2 yield of 5.7&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are a large family of functional materials with diverse applications such as in electrochemical fields. However, their use in the emerging two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction for clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is lagging. Herein, a general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is demonstrated, through which an abnormal NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 generation. The resultant NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure has a stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water, and a leaf&#8208;like morphology composed of interconnected small&#8208;size nanosheets with identical orientation and predominate {210} side surface exposure. Our studies show that the Ni&#8722;N centers on {210} facets are the active sites, and the saturated lattice H2O favors a six&#8208;coordinated environment that results in high selectivity. The &#8220;perfect&#8221; structure including stoichiometric composition and ideal facet exposure leads to a high selectivity of ~100&#8201;% and H2O2 yield of 5.7&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, superior to the reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts and most other electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Electron&#8208;Density Distribution of UCl4 and Its Topology from X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the unprecedented sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to 5&#8201;f electrons in actinide materials. This was made possible by recent advances in the experimental setup as well as data reduction strategy, and, crucially, by comparison with accurate quantum&#8208;mechanical simulations. The electron density of UCl4 crystals has been analysed. Several indicators have been discussed that reveal the participation of 5&#8201;f electrons to chemical bonds.







Abstract
The chemistry of 

5f

 ${5f}$



 electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X&#8208;ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered &#8220;almost impossible&#8221; on heavy&#8208;atom systems, until very recently.

&lt;p&gt;We discuss the unprecedented sensitivity of X-ray diffraction to 5&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; electrons in actinide materials. This was made possible by recent advances in the experimental setup as well as data reduction strategy, and, crucially, by comparison with accurate quantum-mechanical simulations. The electron density of UCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystals has been analysed. Several indicators have been discussed that reveal the participation of 5&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; electrons to chemical bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of

 electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X-ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered &#8220;almost impossible&#8221; on heavy-atom systems, until very recently. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron density distribution in UCl_&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystals and comparison with the previously reported spin density distribution from polarized neutron diffraction. All approaches provide a consistent picture in terms of electron and spin density distribution, and chemical bond characterization.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Cyclization/Amidation and Amination of 1,6&#8208;Enynes and 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>

We demonstrate a Ni&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive cyclization/amidation and amination of 1,6&#8208;enynes and 1,7&#8208;enynes using dioxazolones or anthranils as nitrene&#8208;transfer reagents. This mild, modular, and practical protocol provides rapid access to a variety of enantioenriched 2&#8208;pyrrolidone and 2&#8208;piperidone derivatives bearing an aminomethylene group at the 4&#8208;position in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of unsaturated hydrocarbons is an appealing synthetic tool for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral amines. Despite significant progress in the asymmetric hydroamination of alkenes, allenes, and 1,3&#8208;dienes, asymmetric hydroamination of 1,6&#8208;enynes or 1,7&#8208;enynes remains rather limited due to the enormous challenges in controlling the chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive cyclization/amidation and amination of 1,6&#8208;enynes and 1,7&#8208;enynes using dioxazolones or anthranils as nitrene&#8208;transfer reagents. This mild, modular, and practical protocol provides rapid access to a variety of enantioenriched 2&#8208;pyrrolidone and 2&#8208;piperidone derivatives bearing an aminomethylene group at the 4&#8208;position in good yields (up to 83&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (46&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the reaction is initiated by hydronickelation of alkynes followed by migratory insertion into alkenes, rather than by a [2+2+1] oxidative addition process of nickel to alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photo&#8208;Assisted Phase Switching of Antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Ferroelectric Orders in an I3&#8722;&#8208;Intercalated 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a new I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalated 2D perovskite antiferroelectric with an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap (~1.65&#8197;eV), of which AFE&#8208;to&#8208;FE phase switching is easily obtained upon visible light, due to the reduction of phase switching barrier caused by light&#8208;sensitive I3&#8722; anion. This work paves a pathway to develop future photoelectroactive materials with potential applications.







Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) has emerged as a promising branch of electroactive materials, due to intriguing physical attributes stemming from the electric field&#8208;induced antipolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transformation. However, the requirement of extremely high electric field strength to switch adjacent sublattice polarization poses great challenges for exploiting new molecular AFE system. Although photoirradiation is striking as a noncontact and nondestructive manipulation tool to optimize physical properties, optical control of antiferroelectricity still remains unexplored. Here, by adopting light&#8208;sensitive I3&#8722; anion into 2D perovskite family, we design a new I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalated molecular AFE of (t&#8208;ACH)2EA2Pb3I10(I3)0.5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;((H3O)(H2O))0.5 (1, t&#8208;ACH=trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate, EA=ethylammonium). The I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalating gives an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV with strong absorption. In term of AFE structure, the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of electric dipoles results in a large spontaneous polarization of 4.3&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. Strikingly, 1 merely shows AFE behaviour in the dark even under ultrahigh voltage, while the field&#8208;induced ferroelectric state can be facilely obtained upon visible illumination. Such unprecedented visible&#8208;photo&#8208;assisted phase switching ascribes to the incorporation of photoactive I3&#8722; anions that reduces AFE&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric switching barrier. This pioneering work on the photo&#8208;assisting transformation of ferroic orders paves a way to develop future photoactive materials with potential applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Modulation for Selective Mechanochemical Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy used for the iron&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic olefins is developed. This combined catalytic system through the integration of Fe(III)/porphyrin and cyclodextrins under the optimal ball&#8208;milling conditions enables a collaborative oxidation process and provides a wide range of Markovnikov&#8208;selective ketone products with markedly enhanced catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch procedures.







Abstract
The development of a mechanochemical Fe&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of olefins with a sustainable and benign procedure holds significant promise for industrial applications. However, navigating the intricate interactions inherent in ball&#8208;milling conditions to fine&#8208;tune reaction selectivity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, leveraging the dispersive and/or trapping properties of cyclodextrins, an innovative mechanochemical approach is developed through the integration of cyclodextrins into a Fe&#8208;catalyzed system, enabling a streamlined Wacker oxidation process from simple and/or commercially available alkenes. Our efforts have yielded optimized mechanochemical conditions demonstrating exceptional reactivity and selectivity in generating a diverse array of ketone products, markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch methods. Mechanistic investigations have revealed a predominantly Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalytic cycle, effectively minimizing undesired alcohol formation, hydrogenation, and the other competing pathways, boosting both reaction yield and selectivity.

         <title>Stapled Peptides as Inhibitors of mRNA Deadenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based design approach led to a stapled peptide that inhibits the deadenylation activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex. The stapled peptide exhibited excellent cell permeability and high binding affinity to the target protein. The peptide was able to stabilize RNA containing poly(A) tail by inhibiting the activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex both in vitro and at the cellular level.







Abstract
Therapeutic intervention targeting mRNA typically aims at reducing the levels of disease&#8208;causing sequences. Achieving the opposite effect of blocking the destruction of beneficial mRNA remains underexplored. The degradation of mRNA starts with the removal of poly(A) tails, reducing their stability and translational activity, which is mainly regulated by the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex. The subunit NOT9 binds various RNA binding proteins, that recruit mRNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner to the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex to promote their deadenylation. These RNA binding proteins interact with NOT9 through a helical NOT9 binding motif, which we used as a starting point for development of the hydrocarbon stapled peptide NIP&#8208;2. The peptide (KD=60.4&#8197;nM) was able to inhibit RNA&#8208;binding (IC50=333&#8197;nM) as well as the deadenylation activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex in vitro while being cell&#8208;permeable (cell&#8208;permeability EC50=2.44&#8197;&#956;M). A co&#8208;crystal structure of NIP&#8208;2 bound to NOT9 allowed further optimization of the peptide through point mutation leading to NIP&#8208;2&#8208;H27A&#8208;N3 (KD=122&#8197;nM) with high cell permeability (cell&#8208;permeability EC50=0.34&#8197;&#956;M).

&lt;p&gt;A structure-based design approach led to a stapled peptide that inhibits the deadenylation activity of the CCR4-NOT complex. The stapled peptide exhibited excellent cell permeability and high binding affinity to the target protein. The peptide was able to stabilize RNA containing poly(A) tail by inhibiting the activity of the CCR4-NOT complex both in vitro and at the cellular level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic intervention targeting mRNA typically aims at reducing the levels of disease-causing sequences. Achieving the opposite effect of blocking the destruction of beneficial mRNA remains underexplored. The degradation of mRNA starts with the removal of poly(A) tails, reducing their stability and translational activity, which is mainly regulated by the CCR4-NOT complex. The subunit NOT9 binds various RNA binding proteins, that recruit mRNA in a sequence-specific manner to the CCR4-NOT complex to promote their deadenylation. These RNA binding proteins interact with NOT9 through a helical NOT9 binding motif, which we used as a starting point for development of the hydrocarbon stapled peptide &lt;b&gt;NIP-2&lt;/b&gt;. The peptide (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=60.4&#8197;nM) was able to inhibit RNA-binding (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=333&#8197;nM) as well as the deadenylation activity of the CCR4-NOT complex in vitro while being cell-permeable (cell-permeability EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=2.44&#8197;&#956;M). A co-crystal structure of &lt;b&gt;NIP-2&lt;/b&gt; bound to NOT9 allowed further optimization of the peptide through point mutation leading to &lt;b&gt;NIP-2-H27A-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=122&#8197;nM) with high cell permeability (cell-permeability EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=0.34&#8197;&#956;M). The optimized peptide was able to inhibit deadenylation of target mRNAs when used in HeLa cells at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M, demonstrating the feasibility of increasing mRNA stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Key Descriptors for Predicting the Exciton Binding Energy of Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation properties are identified for predicting the exciton binding energy in solid state and an unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning, which will enable fast and precise screening of efficient organic photovoltaic materials with low exciton binding energy.







Abstract
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter to determine the mechanism and performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Small Eb benefits to reduce the interfacial energy offset and the energy loss of organic solar cells. However, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the Eb in solid state with considering electronic polarization effects are extremely time&#8208;consuming. Furthermore, current studies lack critical descriptors. Here, we use data&#8208;driven machine learning (ML) to accelerate the computation and identify the key descriptors most relevant to the solid&#8208;state Eb. The results verify two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation&#8208;state properties for efficient prediction of the solid&#8208;state Eb. Moreover, a very high accuracy is achieved by using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.92. Finally, we use this ML model to predict the Eb of thin films, which is difficult to achieve using the current quantum&#8208;chemical calculations due to the large structural disorder. Remarkably, the predicted thin&#8208;film Eb values are fully consistent with the results of temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. Therefore, our work provides an accurate and efficient approach to predict the solid&#8208;state Eb and would be helpful to accelerate the exploitation of novel promising organic photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Origin of Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Restructured Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidation strategy was employed for the controllable reconstruction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOFs), elucidating the functionality of Fe and defect in NiO6 via in situ tracking and theoretical calculations, thereby enhancing metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization and oxygen evolution activity. The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis featuring Ni(Fe) MOF as the anode demonstrates industrial&#8208;level current density and outstanding durability.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), praised for structural flexibility and tunability, are prominent catalyst prototypes for exploring oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their intricate transformations under OER, especially in industrial high&#8208;current environments, pose significant challenges in accurately elucidating their structure&#8211;activity correlation. Here, we harnessed an electrooxidation process for controllable MOF reconstruction, discovering that Fe doping expedites Ni(Fe) MOF structural evolution, accompanied by the elongation of Ni&#8722;O bonds, monitored by in situ Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy. Theoretical modeling further reveals that Fe doping and defect&#8208;induced tensile strain in the NiO6 octahedra augments the metal ds&#8208;O p hybridization, optimizing their adsorption behavior and augmenting OER activity. The reconstructed Ni(Fe) MOF, serving as the anode in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves a noteworthy current density of 3300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.2&#8197;V while maintaining equally stable operation 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 300&#8197;h and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 170&#8197;h. This undertaking elevates our comprehension of OER catalyst reconstruction, furnishing promising avenues for designing highly efficacious catalysts across electrochemical platforms.

         <title>Artificial Electron Channels Enable Contact Prelithiation of Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes with Ultrahigh Li&#8208;Source Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li&#8722;Ag alloy&#8208;based artificial electron channels (AECs) are inserted into the Li source/anode interface for a high&#8208;efficiency contact prelithiation process. The AECs with shielding effect could restrict the dry&#8208;state interfacial corrosion, ensuring unimpeded electron transport throughout the prelithiation. Therefore, the Li source could convert deeply, showcasing a high Li&#8208;source utilization (90.7&#8201;%) and a dead&#8208;Li&#8208;free morphology.







Abstract
Contact prelithiation is widely used to compensate for the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the low utilization of the Li source, which suffers from the deteriorated contact interfaces, results in cycling degeneration. Herein, Li&#8722;Ag alloy&#8208;based artificial electron channels (AECs) are established in Li source/graphite anode contact interfaces to promote Li&#8208;source conversion. Due to the shielding effect of the Li&#8722;Ag alloy (50 at. % Li) on Li&#8208;ion diffusion, the dry&#8208;state interfacial corrosion is restricted. The unblocked electronic conduction across the AEC&#8208;involved interface not only facilitates the Li&#8208;source conversion but also accelerates the prelithiation kinetics during the wet&#8208;state process, resulting in an ultrahigh Li&#8208;source utilization (90.7&#8201;%). Implementing AEC&#8208;assisted prelithiation in a LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell yields a 35.8&#8201;% increase in energy density and stable cycling over 600 cycles. This finding affords significant insights into the construction of an efficient prelithiation technology for the development of high&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Tuning Reaction Kinetics of Fluorinated Molecules to Construct Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphases on SiOx Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the impact of electrolyte additive decomposition kinetics on SEI properties in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, diethyl fluoromalonate (F1DEM) and diethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoromalonate (F2DEM) were designed and employed in SiOx anodes. The locally polar &#8722;CHF&#8722; group demonstrates superior decomposition kinetics compared to the symmetric &#8722;CF2&lt;M&#8722;&gt; group, quickly forming a LiF&#8208;rich passivation layer on the anode surface during the initial stages of SEI formation, thereby effectively suppressing side reactions.







Abstract
Introducing fluorinated electrolyte additives to construct LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Si&#8208;based anodes is proven an effective strategy for coping with its massive volume changes during cycling. However, most current research on fluorine&#8208;containing additives focuses on their thermodynamics of decomposition, lacking studies on the correlation between the molecular structure of additives and their decomposition kinetics. Herein, two fluorinated ester additives, diethyl fluoromalonate (F1DEM) and diethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoromalonate (F2DEM) were designed and synthesized. Through combining a wealth of characterizations and simulations, it is revealed that despite the similar reduction thermodynamics, the favorable reduction kinetics of single&#8208;fluorinated F1DEM facilitate a LiF&#8208;rich layer during the early stage of SEI formation, contributing to the formation of a more robust SEI on SiOx anode compared to the difluorinated F2DEM. Consequently, the proposed additive achieves excellent cycling stability (84&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) for 5&#8197;Ah 21700 cylindrical batteries under practical testing conditions. By unveiling the role of reaction kinetics, a long&#8208;overlooked aspect for the study of electrolyte additives, this work sheds light on how to construct a stable SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes.

The locally polar &#8722;CHF&#8722; group demonstrates superior decomposition kinetics compared to the symmetric &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;M&#8722;&amp;gt;&lt;/sub&gt; group, quickly forming a LiF-rich passivation layer on the anode surface during the initial stages of SEI formation, thereby effectively suppressing side reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing fluorinated electrolyte additives to construct LiF-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Si-based anodes is proven an effective strategy for coping with its massive volume changes during cycling. However, most current research on fluorine-containing additives focuses on their thermodynamics of decomposition, lacking studies on the correlation between the molecular structure of additives and their decomposition kinetics. Herein, two fluorinated ester additives, diethyl fluoromalonate (F1DEM) and diethyl 2,2-difluoromalonate (F2DEM) were designed and synthesized. Through combining a wealth of characterizations and simulations, it is revealed that despite the similar reduction thermodynamics, the favorable reduction kinetics of single-fluorinated F1DEM facilitate a LiF-rich layer during the early stage of SEI formation, contributing to the formation of a more robust SEI on SiO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; anode compared to the difluorinated F2DEM. Consequently, the proposed additive achieves excellent cycling stability (84&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) for 5&#8197;Ah 21700 cylindrical batteries under practical testing conditions. By unveiling the role of reaction kinetics, a long-overlooked aspect for the study of electrolyte additives, this work sheds light on how to construct a stable SEI on Si-based anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing the Unconventional Cubic Phase in 2D LaNiO3 Perovskite for Highly Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microwave shock method has been developed to facilitate the rapid synthesis of 2D LaNiO3 in common hexagonal, unconventional cubic, and trigonal crystal phases, preventing high&#8208;temperature stacking. This groundbreaking approach reveals the superior catalytic activity of the unconventional cubic phase, significantly advancing the phase engineering&#8208;dependent UOR mechanisms in 2D materials.







Abstract
Phase engineering is a critical strategy in electrocatalysis, as it allows for the modulation of electronic, geometric, and chemical properties to directly influence the catalytic performance. Despite its potential, phase engineering remains particularly challenging in thermodynamically stable perovskites, especially in a 2D structure constraint. Herein, we report phase engineering in 2D LaNiO3 perovskite using the strongly non&#8208;equilibrium microwave shock method. This approach enables the synthesis of conventional hexagonal and unconventional trigonal and cubic phases in LaNiO3 by inducing selective phase transitions at designed temperatures, followed by rapid quenching to allow precise phase control while preserving the 2D porous structure. These phase transitions induce structural distortions in the [LaO]+ layers and the hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p states, modifying local charge distribution and enhancing electron transport during the six&#8208;electron urea oxidation process (UOR). The cubic LaNiO3 offers optimal electron transport and active site accessibility due to its high structural symmetry and open interlayer spacing, resulting in a low onset potential of 1.27&#8197;V and a Tafel slope of 33.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 for UOR, outperforming most current catalysts. Our strategy features high designability in phase engineering, enabling various electrocatalysts to harness the power of unconventional phases.

         <title>Rigid Ligand Confined Synthesis of Carbon Supported Dimeric Fe Sites with High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared by a rigid ligand confinement strategy, and shows excellent performance for oxygen reduction reaction. The active site of Fe dimers, which favors the adsorption of OOH* with Yeager&#8208;type binding, is advantageous over single&#8208;atom site in promoting reaction process. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery achieves small charge/discharge voltage gaps during charge/discharge test.







Abstract
Dimeric metal sites (DiMSs) in carbon&#8208;based single atom catalysts (SACs) offer distinct advantages in optimizing the adsorption energies of the catalytic intermediates and reaction pathways over single atom sites, which inspires the investigations on the rational design of DiMSs&#8208;based SACs and the accurate discernment of catalytic mechanisms. Here, dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared using the precursor of metal&#8208;organic complex with a controlled structure, and the rigid ligand confinement secures the preservation of dimeric Fe sites during the thermal treatment. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.917&#8197;V, and excellent durability with negligible activity decay. Theoretical studies reveal that the dimeric Fe sites have an optimal adsorption of OOH* with the Yeager&#8208;type binding, illustrating the advantages of DiMSs over SAs in catalyzing ORR. The rechargeable aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled using DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based air cathodes achieve small voltage gaps after long term charge/discharge test, showing great promises for practical applications. This synthetic strategy serves a novel platform to produce a scope of catalysts incorporating multimeric metal sites, and studies on the catalytic mechanism lay the foundation for establishing cooperative effect for multidentate adsorption reactions.

         <title>Diphenylacetylene&#8208;Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins with diphenylacetylene as a key building block have been prepared. Owing to the rigidity of the resulting macrocycle, conformational isomers can be isolated, unlike known, flexible expanded porphyrins. The irreversible conformational inversion, coupled with the distinct spectral and color features of the isomers, allowed us to fabricate a new accumulated thermal sensor capable of indicating exposure to high temperatures.







Abstract
An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as 1A and 1B. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer 1B leads to its irreversible conversion to 1A, whereas in its protonated form, 1A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA undergoes irreversible transformation to 1B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA at lower temperatures. These temperature&#8208;dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.

         <title>Reversible Structural Phase Transitions in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;Based Metal Halides for Dynamically Tunable Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zero&#8208;dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides exhibit reversible phase transitions accompanied by a fluorescence shift from cyan to yellow&#8208;orange. Their luminescence and phase transition mechanisms are elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. By harnessing their reversible phase transitions, a dynamic tunable multicolor emission anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with high security and unforgeability is demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring structural phase transitions and luminescence mechanisms in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides poses significant challenges, that are crucial for unlocking the full potential of tunable optical properties and diversifying their functional capabilities. Herein, we have designed two inter&#8208;transformable 0D Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides, namely (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6, through distinct synthesis conditions utilizing identical reactants. Their optical properties and luminescence mechanisms were systematically elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. The bright cyan&#8208;fluorescent (C19H18P)2CuI3 with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 77&#8201;% is attributed to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Differently, the broad yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence of (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 displays a remarkable PLQY of 83&#8201;%. Its luminescence mechanism is mainly attributed to the combined effects of metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer and cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer, which effects stem from the strong Cu&#8722;Cu bonding interactions in the (Cu4I6)2&#8722; clusters. Moreover, (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 exhibit reversible structural phase transitions. The elucidation of the phase transitions mechanism has paved the way for an unforgeable anti&#8208;counterfeiting system. This system dynamically shifts between cyan and yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence, triggered by the phase transitions, bolstering security and authenticity. This work enriches the luminescence theory of 0D metal halides, offering novel strategies for optical property modulation and fostering optical applications.

The bright cyan-fluorescent (C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 77&#8201;% is attributed to the self-trapped exciton emission. Differently, the broad yellow-orange fluorescence of (C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; displays a remarkable PLQY of 83&#8201;%. Its luminescence mechanism is mainly attributed to the combined effects of metal/halide-to-ligand charge transfer and cluster-centered charge transfer, which effects stem from the strong Cu&#8722;Cu bonding interactions in the (Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; clusters. Moreover, (C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit reversible structural phase transitions. The elucidation of the phase transitions mechanism has paved the way for an unforgeable anti-counterfeiting system. This system dynamically shifts between cyan and yellow-orange fluorescence, triggered by the phase transitions, bolstering security and authenticity. This work enriches the luminescence theory of 0D metal halides, offering novel strategies for optical property modulation and fostering optical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dye Induced Luminescence Properties of Gold(I) Complexes with near Unity Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Improving the glow of gold complexes. Herein, we report a facile synthetic strategy to introduce a dye, namely, 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin, as a ligand to access luminescent gold complexes of different nuclearity. Introduction of the dye enables the isolation of gold complexes with rich photophysical properties such as high emission quantum yields.







Abstract
To study the effect of a dye on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of metal complexes, a series of gold(I) complexes were synthesized, containing a 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin luminophore. The complexes are comprised of a coumarin moiety featuring different ancillary ligands, specifically N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, triphenylphosphine, and diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylphosphine. The synthesized gold(I) complexes are luminescent both in solution and the solid state at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Complexes of different nuclearity, i.e., mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trinuclear compounds were synthesized. A clear trend between the nuclearity and the quantum yields can be seen. The coumarin dye not only improves the PL properties, but also enhances the luminescence of trinuclear clusters, which are otherwise known to be weak emitters in solution. The optical absorption properties were investigated in detail by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Chiral Helicene&#8208;Indenido ansa&#8208; and Half&#8208;Sandwich Metal Complexes and Their Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereocontrolled syntheses of chiral (oxa)helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich (Rh) or ansa&#8208;metallocene (Fe) complexes were developed. The enantio&#8208; and diastereopure half&#8208;sandwich Rh(III) complexes were used as catalysts in enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation to form axially chiral biaryls in up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er, and an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer was described.







Abstract
Despite recent tremendous progress in the synthesis of nonplanar chiral aromatics, and helicenes in particular, their conversion to half&#8208;sandwich or sandwich transition metal complexes still lags behind, although they represent an attractive family of modular and underexplored chiral architectures with a potential catalytic use. In this work, starting from various chiral helicene&#8208;indene proligands, we prepared the enantio&#8208; and diastereopure oxa[6]&#8208; and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhI and RhIII complexes and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;bisindenido ansa&#8208;metallocene FeII complex. To document their use, oxahelicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhIII complexes were employed as chiral catalysts in enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to afford a series of axially chiral biaryls in mostly good to high yields and in up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er. Thus, we developed stereocontrolled synthesis of chiral helicene&#8208;indenido ansa&#8208; and half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes, successfully demonstrated the first use of such helicene Cp&#8208;related metal complexes in enantioselective catalysis, and described an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; Strategy for Enhancing Gas Adsorption and Separation through Aperture Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of MOF@PCC composites was prepared by linking porous coordination cages (PCCs) onto the surface of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles by mechanochemical reactions. The surface cages optimize the pores of the composites, and polar functional groups interact with gas molecules. The combinations of PCCs and MOFs with aligned aperture sizes give enhanced gas adsorption capacities for binary gas separation and other applications.







Abstract
Post&#8208;modification of porous materials with molecular modulators has emerged as a well&#8208;established strategy for improving gas adsorption and separation. However, a notable challenge lies in maintaining porosity and the limited applicability of the current method. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy, utilizing porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic pores and apertures as surface modulators to improve the gas adsorption and separation properties of the parent MOFs. We demonstrated the fast and facile preparation of 28 distinct MOF@PCC composites by combining 7 MOFs with 4 PCCs with varying aperture sizes and exposed functional groups through a mechanochemical reaction in 5 mins. Only the combinations of PCCs and MOFs with closely matched aperture sizes exhibited enhanced gas adsorption and separation performance. Specifically, MOF&#8208;808@PCC&#8208;4 exhibited a significantly increased C2H2 uptake (+64&#8201;%) and a longer CO2/C2H2 separation retention time (+40&#8201;%). MIL&#8208;101@PCC&#8208;4 achieved a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity of 6.11&#8197;mmol/g. This work not only highlights the broad applicability of the mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy for the functionalization of a wide range of MOFs but also establishes potential design principles for the development of hybrid porous materials with enhanced gas adsorption and separation capabilities, along with promising applications in catalysis and intracellular delivery.

         <title>Lighting Up Bispyrene&#8208;Functionalized Chiral Molecular Muscles with Switchable Circularly Polarized Excimer Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of both the unique structural and chiral features of molecular [c2]daisy chain, the first circularly polarized luminescence switch based on chiral molecular muscle has been successfully constructed, not only successfully widening the application scopes of molecular muscles, but also providing a promising platform for the construction of novel smart chiral luminescent materials for practical applications.







Abstract
Aiming at the further extension of the application scope of traditional molecular muscles, a novel bispyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecular [c2]daisy chain was designed and synthesized. Taking advantage of the unique dimeric interlocked structure of molecular [c2]daisy chain, the resultant chiral molecular muscle emits strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) attributed to the pyrene excimer with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 0.010. More importantly, along with the solvent&#8208; or anion&#8208; induced motions of the chiral molecular muscle, the precise regulation of the pyrene stacking within its skeleton results in the switching towards either &#8220;inversed&#8221; state with sign inversion and larger glum values or &#8220;down&#8221; state with maintained handedness and smaller glum values, making it a novel multistate CPL switch. As the first example of chiral molecular muscle&#8208;based CPL switch, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study not only successfully widens the application scopes of molecular muscles, but also provides a promising platform for the construction of novel smart chiral luminescent materials for practical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming at the further extension of the application scope of traditional molecular muscles, a novel bispyrene-functionalized chiral molecular [c2]daisy chain was designed and synthesized. Taking advantage of the unique dimeric interlocked structure of molecular [c2]daisy chain, the resultant chiral molecular muscle emits strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) attributed to the pyrene excimer with a high dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) value of 0.010. More importantly, along with the solvent- or anion- induced motions of the chiral molecular muscle, the precise regulation of the pyrene stacking within its skeleton results in the switching towards either &lt;i&gt;&#8220;inversed&#8221;&lt;/i&gt; state with sign inversion and larger &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values or &lt;i&gt;&#8220;down&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; state with maintained handedness and smaller &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values, making it a novel multistate CPL switch. As the first example of chiral molecular muscle-based CPL switch, this proof-of-concept study not only successfully widens the application scopes of molecular muscles, but also provides a promising platform for the construction of novel smart chiral luminescent materials for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Overall Splitting of Pure Water in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Violent H2 and O2 bubbling production with rates as high as 4.41 and 2.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;gcat.&#8722;1 respectively is achieved in photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O in a porous microreactor (PP12). PP12 promotes charge separation and formation of catalytic active sites, thus leading to the greatly enhanced H2 and O2 bubbling productions in PP12. This opens a new way to enhance photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O.







Abstract
Photocatalytic overall splitting of pure water (H2O) without sacrificial reagent to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) holds a great potential for achieving carbon neutrality. Herein, by anchoring cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) as cocatalyst and cadmium sulfide (CdS) as light absorber to channel wall of a porous polymer microreactor (PP12), continuous violent H2 and O2 bubbling productions from photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent is achieved, with H2 and O2 production rates as high as 4.41 and 2.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;gcat.&#8722;1 respectively. These are significantly enhanced than those in the widely used stirred tank&#8208;type reactor in which no O2 is produced and H2 production rate is only 0.004&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;gcat.&#8722;1. Besides improved charge separation and interaction of H2O with photocatalyst in PP12, bonding interaction of Co9S8 with PP12 creates abundant catalytic active sites for simultaneous productions of H2 and O2, thus leading to the significantly enhanced H2 and O2 bubbling productions in PP12. This offers a new strategy to enhance photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Solution&#8208;Processed and Structurally Ordered Fullerene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene derivative (BTPC60) has been developed, which inhibits self&#8208;aggregation of C60 cages and promotes the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film. Inverted perovskite solar cells based on solution&#8208;processed BTPC60 delivered an impressive efficiency of 25.3&#8201;% and maintain an efficiency of 24.8&#8201;% even with an electron transporting layer thickness of up to 200&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The electron transporting layer (ETL) used in high performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is typically composed of C60, which requires time&#8208;consuming and costly thermal evaporation deposition, posing a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale production. To address this challenge, herein, we present a novel design of solution&#8208;processible electron transporting material (ETM) by grafting a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor fragment onto C60. The synthesized BTPC60 exhibits an exceptional solution processability and well&#8208;organized molecular stacking pattern, enabling the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film with high electron mobility. When applied as ETL in inverted PSCs, BTPC60 not only exhibits excellent interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced electron extraction and transfer efficiency, but also effectively passivates the interfacial defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. Resultant BTPC60&#8208;based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3&#8201;% and retain almost 90&#8201;% of the initial values after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1500&#8197;hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution&#8208;processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8&#8201;% with the ETL thickness of 200&#8197;nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution&#8208;processed fullerene&#8208;based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.

         <title>A Dynamically Ion&#8208;Sieved Electrolyte towards Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte was developed to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The experiment characterizations and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the dynamic ion screen is achieved at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of desolvated/solvated Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces.







Abstract
The practical deployment of Zn&#8208;ion batteries faces challenges such as dendrite growth, side reactions and cathode dissolution in traditional electrolytes. Here, we develop a highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution. The dynamic ion screen at the electrode/electrolyte interface is achieved by numerous pyrane rings with a radius of 3.69&#8197;&#197;, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ and Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces. As a proof of concept, Zn//Zn symmetric cells deliver exceptional cyclic stability for over 6,800&#8197;h and ultrahigh cumulative plated capacity of 1.95&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Zn//Na2Mn3O7 cells exhibit satisfactory cycling performance with capacity retention of 82.7&#8201;% after 4,000&#8197;cycles, and the assembled pouch cells achieve excellent stability and durability. This work provides valuable insights into the development of electrolytes aimed at enhancing the interface stability of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Film Formation Kinetics for Record Efficiency in Difluorobenzothiadizole&#8208;Based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT)&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, were synthesized to assess their impact on device performance. PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO, leading to improved phase separation and enhanced molecular packing in the active layer. This optimized morphology, along with a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, resulted in a record efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers.







Abstract
The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron&#8208;accepting building blocks used to construct D&#8208;A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT&#8208;based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene&#8208;based OSCs owing to their strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, incorporating different &#960;&#8208;bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT&#8208;4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8&#8208;BO compared to PffBT&#8208;2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT&#8208;4T&#8208;based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5&#8201;%, setting a new record for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers. Our findings underscore the importance of conjugate backbone modulation in controlling aggregation behavior and film formation kinetics, providing valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance polymer donors in organic photovoltaics.

&lt;p&gt;Two difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT)-based copolymers, PffBT-2T and PffBT-4T, were synthesized to assess their impact on device performance. PffBT-4T demonstrated lower miscibility with L8-BO, leading to improved phase separation and enhanced molecular packing in the active layer. This optimized morphology, along with a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, resulted in a record efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% for ffBT-based photovoltaic polymers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron-accepting building blocks used to construct D-A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT-based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene-based OSCs owing to their strong temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT-based copolymers, PffBT-2T and PffBT-4T, incorporating different &#960;-bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT-4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8-BO compared to PffBT-2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT-4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT-4T-based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5&#8201;%, setting a new record for ffBT-based photovoltaic polymers.

         <title>Highly Efficient Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from Doped Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the thionation products of phthalimide into its matrix leads to highly efficient red/near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence with boosted quantum yields of up to ~33&#8201;%. Newly generated emissive clusters and the external heavy atom effect are two key factors to the red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence, while the high efficiency arises from the enhanced exciton generation efficiency and energy transfer process upon doping.







Abstract
Organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with low toxicity and facile synthesis are highly sought after, particularly for applications in biotechnology and encryption. However, achieving efficient red/NIR RTP emitters has been challenging due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling of organics and the rapid nonradiative decay imposed by the energy gap law. Here we demonstrate highly efficient red/NIR RTP with boosted quantum yields (&#934;ps) of up to 32.96&#8201;% through doping the thionated derivatives of phthalimide (PAI) (MTPAI and DTPAI) into PAI crystals. The red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence (PL) stems from a combination of the external heavy atom effect and the formation of emissive clusters centered around electron&#8208;rich sulfur atoms. Furthermore, the dopants enhance exciton generation efficiency and facilitate energy transfer from smaller PAI units to larger aggregates, leading to dramatically increased &#934;p. This strategy proves universal, opening possibilities for acquiring long&#8208;wavelength RTP with tunable photophysical properties. The doped crystals exhibit promising applications in optical waveguides and encryption paper/ink. This research provides a practical approach to obtaining long&#8208;wavelength RTP materials and offers valuable insights into the mechanisms governing host&#8208;guest systems.

         <title>Asymmetrified Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Solid Additives Enable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Two electron&#8208;deficient isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives to optimize the properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device, SF&#8208;1&#8208; and SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated devices displayed regulated fibrillar donor&#8208;acceptor network, improved exciton diffusion length, and thus enhanced power conversion efficiencies approaching 19&#8201;%, which is one of rare solid additives for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells.







Abstract
Disordered polymer chain entanglements within all&#8208;polymer blends limit the formation of optimal donor&#8208;acceptor phase separation. Therefore, developing effective methods to regulate morphology evolution is crucial for achieving optimal morphological features in all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). In this study, two isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives based on the widely&#8208;used electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole unit in nonfullerene acceptors. The incorporation of SF&#8208;1 or SF&#8208;2 into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend induces stronger molecular packing via molecular interaction, leading to the formation of continuous interpenetrated networks with suitable phase&#8208;separation and vertical distribution. Furthermore, after treatment with SF&#8208;1 and SF&#8208;2, the exciton diffusion lengths for PY&#8208;DT films are extended to over 40&#8197;nm, favoring exciton diffusion and charge transport. The asymmetrical SF&#8208;2, characterized by an enhanced dipole moment, increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device to 18.83&#8201;% due to stronger electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a ternary device strategy boosts the PCE of SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated APSC to over 19&#8201;%. This work not only demonstrates one of the best performances of APSCs but also offers an effective approach to manipulate the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends using rational&#8208;designed solid additives.

         <title>Unveiling Ionized Interfacial Water&#8208;Induced Localized H* Enrichment for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen atoms, especially Cl in atomically precise copper halide clusters [Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X=Cl, Br, I)], can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a process that requires the participation of eight electrons and nine protons. The regulation of active hydrogen (H*) supply and a deep understanding of related processes are necessary for improving the ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we synthesized a series of atomically precise copper&#8208;halide clusters Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X=Cl, Br, I), among which the Cu2Cl2(BINAP)2 cluster shows the optimal ammonia FE of 94.0&#8201;% and an ammonia yield rate of 373&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that halogen atoms, especially Cl in Cu2Cl2(BIANP)2, can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia. This work explains the role of H* in the hydrogenation process of NO3RR and the importance of localized H* enrichment strategy for improving the FEs.

Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) are important gaseous biological signaling molecules that are involved in complex cellular pathways. A number of physiological processes require both H2S and NO, which has led to the proposal that different H2S/NO&#8901; crosstalk species, including thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;), are responsible for this observed codependence. Despite the importance of these S/N hybrid species, the reported properties and characterization, as well as the fundamental pathways of formation and subsequent reactivity, remain poorly understood. Herein we report new experimental insights into the fundamental reaction chemistry of pathways to form SNO&#8722; and SSNO&#8722;, including mechanisms for proton&#8208;mediated interconversion. In addition, we demonstrate new modes of reactivity with other sulfur&#8208;containing potential crosstalk species, including carbonyl sulfide (COS).

         <title>Thienyltriazine Triamides: Thickness Insensitive Interlayer Materials Featuring Fine&#8208;Tuned Optoelectronic and Aggregation Characters for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every component counts: the optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) are precisely regulated through simultaneous core unit, aromatic arm, and pendant polar group engineering. Consequently, the TTTA TT&#8722;N&#8722;M emerges as a universal cathode interlayer (CIL) material for highly efficient organic solar cells with record&#8208;breaking thickness tolerance, ranking it among the top CIL materials ever identified.







Abstract
A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT&#8722;N&#8722;M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90&#8201;% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95&#8197;nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT&#8722;N&#8722;M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60&#8201;% for single&#8208;junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi&#8208;armed CIL&#8208;based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high&#8208;performing CIL materials documented thus far. This work not only broadens the scope of CIL materials for OSCs but also offers deep insights into design strategies and structure&#8208;properties relationships, being beneficial for the future development of more efficient CIL materials for organic optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Sublimation Transformation Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a straightforward sublimation transformation strategy for the controllable synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Fe catalyst (Fe2/NC), overcoming the randomness and complexity of previous synthesis strategies. Experimental evidence and microkinetic analysis demonstrated that the adjacent Fe sites and optimal Fe&#8722;Fe distance in Fe2/NC were vital for the adsorption of O2 on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable catalytic reactivity. However, achieving atomically precise control in the fabrication of DACs remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed a straightforward and direct sublimation transformation synthesis strategy for dual&#8208;atom Fe catalysts (Fe2/NC) by utilizing in situ generated Fe2Cl6(g) dimers from FeCl3(s). The structure of Fe2/NC was investigated by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. As&#8208;obtained Fe2/NC, with a Fe&#8722;Fe distance of 0.3&#8197;nm inherited from Fe2Cl6, displayed superior oxygen reduction performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V (vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts, Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/NC), and its counterpart with a common and shorter Fe&#8722;Fe distance of ~0.25&#8197;nm (Fe2/NC&#8208;S). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis revealed the extended Fe&#8722;Fe distance in Fe2/NC is crucial for the O2 adsorption on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This work not only introduces a new approach for fabricating atomically precise DACs, but also offers a deeper understanding of the intermetallic distance effect on dual&#8208;site catalysis.

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation via Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis with FeIII&#8208;Initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), where the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2 further enhance 1O2 generation. In this SF&#8208;CEC system, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can degrade protonated azo dyes by nearly 99&#8201;% within 10&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Contact Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) using commercial dielectric materials in contact&#8208;separation cycles with water can trigger interfacial electron transfer and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the inherent hydrophobicity of commercial dielectric materials limits the effective reaction sites, and the generated ROS inevitably undergo self&#8208;combination to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In typical CEC systems, H2O2 does not further decompose into ROS, leading to suboptimal reaction rates. Addressing the generation and activation of H2O2 is therefore crucial for advancing CEC. Here, we synthesized a catalyst by loading the dielectric material polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto ZSM&#8208;5 (PTFE/ZSM&#8208;5, PZ for short), achieving uniform dispersion of the catalyst in water for the first time. The introduction of an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), with the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2, further enhanced ROS generation. In the FeIII&#8208;initiated SF&#8208;CEC system, the synergistic effects of ROS and protonated azo dyes enabled nearly 99&#8201;% degradation of azo dyes within 10&#8197;minutes, a sixfold improvement compared to the CEC system. This represents the fastest degradation rate of methyl orange dye induced by ultrasound to date. Without extra oxidants, this system enabled stable dissolution of precious metals in weakly acidic solutions at room temperature, achieving 80&#8201;% gold dissolution within 2&#8197;hours, 2.5&#8197;times faster than similar CEC systems. This study also corrects the unfavorable perception of CEC applications under acidic conditions, providing new insights for the fields of dye degradation and precious metal recovery.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Regeneration of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Catalysis Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural collapse and the metal dissolution have limited the durability of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The oxygen pump strategy can efficiently restrain the collapse. The oxygen pump Ni4Mo provides electrons and oxygenous species for NiFe&#8208;LDH, boosting the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, so as to enhance the durability.







Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) endows NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the frequent evolution and sluggish regeneration of lattice oxygen intensify the dissolution of active species. Herein, we overcome this challenge by constructing the NiFe hydroxide/Ni4Mo alloy (NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo) heterojunction electrocatalyst, featuring the Ni4Mo alloy as the oxygen pump to provide oxygenous intermediates and electrons for NiFe&#8208;LDH. The released lattice oxygen can be timely offset by the oxygenous species during the LOM process, balancing the regeneration of lattice oxygen and assuring the enhancement of the durability. In consequence, the durability of NiFe&#8208;LDH is significantly enhanced after the modification of Ni4Mo with an impressive durability for over 60&#8197;h, much longer than that of NiFe&#8208;LDH counterpart with only 10&#8197;h. In situ spectra and first&#8208;principle simulations reveal that the adsorption of OH&#8722; is significantly strengthened owing to the introduction of Ni4Mo, ensuring the rapid regeneration of lattice oxygen. Moreover, NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) presents an impressive durability for over 150&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The oxygen pump strategy opens opportunities to balance the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, enhancing the durability of efficient OER catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The structural collapse and the metal dissolution have limited the durability of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) during the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The oxygen pump strategy can efficiently restrain the collapse. The oxygen pump Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo provides electrons and oxygenous species for NiFe-LDH, boosting the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, so as to enhance the durability.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in Photoelectrochemical Alcohol Oxidation Enhanced by Nickel&#8208;Based Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction was improved by depositing Ni&#8208;based co&#8208;catalyst on the Fe2O3 photoanode. Compared to alcohol, Ni&#8208;based co&#8208;catalyst has a higher bond dissociation free energy, which ensures the transfer of &#945;&#8208;H from the alcohol molecule to the co&#8208;catalyst through proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process.







Abstract
Using biomass oxidation reactions instead of water oxidation reactions is optimal for accomplishing biomass conversion and effective hydrogen generation. Here, we report that &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes with a NiOOH cocatalyst exhibit excellent performance for photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The conversion efficiency for HMF reaches 98.5&#8201;%, while the selectivity for FDCA is 94.2&#8201;%. We revealed that HMF is oxidized through a spontaneous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process with the high&#8208;valent phase of the Ni&#8208;based catalyst. The dangling oxygen and bridging oxygen of the high&#8208;valent phase species serve as proton&#8208;accepting sites. Furthermore, we pointed out that the deprotonated bond dissociation free energy difference between the catalysts and alcohols is the thermodynamic trigger for the PCET process. This study provides a reasonable explanation for the alcohol oxidation reaction, which is beneficial for designing biomass conversion systems.

         <title>Regulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling by Solid Additive for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SA1 additive with a planar structure can enhance molecular order and packing of active layer. In this way, the phonon scattering is suppressed in the SA1&#8208;assisted blend film, leading to a remarkable PCE of 20&#8201;% for the ternary device.







Abstract
Strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling can hinder exciton transport and induce undesirable non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in a shortened exciton diffusion distance and constrained exciton dissociation in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling is crucially important for achieveing high&#8208;performance OSCs. Here, we employ the solid additive to regulating electron&#8208;phonon coupling in OSCs. The planar configuration of SA1 confers a significant advantage in suppressing lattice vibrations in the active layers, reducing the scattering of excitons by phonons. Consequently, a slow but sustained hole transfer process is identified in the SA1&#8208;assisted film, indicating an enhancement in hole transfer efficiency. Prolonged exciton diffusion length and exciton lifetime are achieved in the blend film processed with SA1, attributed to a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and low energetic disorder for charge carrier transport. As a result, a high efficiency of 20&#8201;% was achieved for ternary device with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current. This work highlights the important role of suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling in improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <dc:description>
Utilizing a series of p&#8208;block metal elements (Ga, In, and Sn) doped RuO2 catalysts, the critical role of interfacial water molecules on regulating the acidic OER activity was investigated. The structurally ordered interfacial water molecules facilitate high&#8208;efficiency proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer across the interface, leading to reduced energy barrier of the follow&#8208;up dissociation process and enhanced kinetics of acidic OER.







Abstract
Understanding the structure and dynamic process of interfacial water molecules at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is highly desirable for the development of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Herein, we construct a series of p&#8208;block metal elements (Ga, In, Sn) doped RuO2 catalysts with manipulated electronic structure and Ru&#8722;O covalency to investigate the effect of electrochemical interfacial engineering on the improvement of acidic OER activity. Associated with operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical analysis, we uncover the free&#8208;H2O enriched local environment and dynamic evolution from 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water to free&#8208;H2O on the surface of Ga&#8722;RuO2, are responsible for the optimized connectivity of hydrogen bonding network in the electrical double layer by promoting solvent reorganization. In addition, the structurally ordered interfacial water molecules facilitate high&#8208;efficiency proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer across the interface, leading to reduced energy barrier of the follow&#8208;up dissociation process and enhanced acidic OER performance. This work highlights the key role of structure and dynamic process of interfacial water for acidic OER, and demonstrates the electrochemical interfacial engineering as an efficient strategy to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Inducible Radiomimetic Photosensitizers Selectively Suppress Cancer Cell Proliferation by Damaging DNA through Radical Cation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;inducible radiomimetic photosensitizers have been developed to damage DNA through radical cation chemistry. They exhibit selective and redox&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and demonstrate significant potential in combination therapy. This innovative approach not only provides an alternative strategy for phototherapy but also establishes a novel cellular platform for studying the direct effects of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiotherapy leverages ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells through direct and indirect effects, and direct effects are considered to play an equal or greater role. Several photosensitizers have been developed to mimic the direct effects of radiotherapy, generating radical cations in DNA models, but none has been applied in cellular studies. Here, we design a radiomimetic photosensitizer, producing DNA radical cations in cells for the first time. To reduce adverse effects, several redox&#8208;inducible precursors are prepared as cancer cells have elevated levels of GSH and H2O2. These precursors respond to GSH or H2O2, releasing the active photosensitizer that captures DNA abasic (AP) sites and generates DNA radical cations upon photolysis, without disrupting the redox state of cells. DNA radical cations migrate freely and are eventually trapped by H2O and O2 to yield DNA lesions, thus triggering DNA damage response. Our study suggests that direct effects of radiotherapy suppress cancer cell proliferation mainly by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, rather than promoting apoptosis. Synergistic effects of the precursor and chemotherapeutic agents are also observed in combination phototherapy. Beyond highlighting an alternative strategy for phototherapy, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study affords a facile cellular platform to study the direct effects of radiotherapy.

DNA radical cations migrate freely and are eventually trapped by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield DNA lesions, thus triggering DNA damage response. Our study suggests that direct effects of radiotherapy suppress cancer cell proliferation mainly by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, rather than promoting apoptosis. Synergistic effects of the precursor and chemotherapeutic agents are also observed in combination phototherapy. Beyond highlighting an alternative strategy for phototherapy, this proof-of-concept study affords a facile cellular platform to study the direct effects of radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Atom Coordination Environments in Carbon Nanofibers via Flash Heating for Highly Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy that prevents collapse, and forms single atoms with tetra&#8208; or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination environments. This ensures fully exposed Co&#8208;N5 sites and high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&#8722;1) is 47.4 times higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
The rational design of carbon&#8208;supported transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts necessitates precise atomic positioning within the precursor. However, structural collapse during pyrolysis can occlude single atoms, posing significant challenges in controlling both their utilization and coordination environment. Herein, we present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy, which ensures that the pre&#8208;designed carbon nanofiber structure remains intact during heating, preventing unforeseen collapse effects and enabling the formation of metal atoms in nano&#8208;environments with either tetra&#8208;nitrogen or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination at different flash heating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that penta&#8208;nitrogen coordinated cobalt atoms (Co&#8208;N5) promote a lower energy pathway for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions compared to the commonly formed Co&#8208;N4 sites. This strategy ensures that Co&#8208;N5 sites are fully exposed on the surface, achieving exceptionally high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&#8722;1) is 47.4 times higher than that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions. The porous, flexible carbon nanofibers significantly enhance zinc&#8208;air battery performance, with a high peak power density (273.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (784.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600&#8197;h. Additionally, the flexible fiber&#8208;shaped zinc&#8208;air battery can power wearable devices, demonstrating significant potential in flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Stereoselective Vinylic C&#8722;H Addition via Metallaphotoredox Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallaphotoredox migration strategy has been developed to achieve stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8722;H activation with aldehydes. This innovative method employs a chiral nickel catalyst in conjunction with a photocatalyst to facilitate a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration, utilizing readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials.







Abstract
Geometrically defined allylic alcohols with SE, SZ, RE and RZ stereoisomers serve as valuable intermediates in synthetic chemistry, attributed to the stereoselective transformations enabled by the alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. When an ideal scenario presents itself with four distinct stereoisomers as potential products, the simultaneous control vicinal stereochemistry in a single step would offer a direct pathway to any desired stereoisomer. Here, we unveil a metallaphotoredox migration strategy to access stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8722;H activation with aldehydes. This method harnesses a chiral nickel catalyst in concert with a photocatalyst to enable a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration by using readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials. The efficacy of this methodology is highlighted by the precise construction of all stereoisomers of allylic alcohols bearing analogous substituents and the efficient synthesis of key intermediates en route to Myristinin family. Experimental and computational studies have shed light on pivotal aspects including the synergy of metal catalysis and photocatalysis, the driving forces behind the migration, and the determination of absolute configuration in the C&#8722;H addition process.

         <title>Effective Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with an Iron&#8208;Xantphos Catalyst: Mechanistic and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction, and reactivity studies are utilized to identify the key organoiron intermediates and reaction pathways, including ligand effects on iron speciation, that enable effective iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
While iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings have been widely studied and developed in the last decade, alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling systems with iron remain underdeveloped despite the importance of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in organic synthesis. A major challenge to the development of these reactions is the current lack of fundamental insight into ligand effects and organoiron intermediates that enable effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl couplings. The current study addresses this longstanding limitation using a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and reactivity studies of alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling with iron&#8208;Xantphos to define the in situ formed iron&#8208;Xantphos intermediates in catalysis. Combined with detailed reactivity studies, the nature of the key mechanistic pathways in catalysis and ligands effects to achieve effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling over competing &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathways are probed. Overall, these foundational studies provide a platform for future bespoke ligand and pre&#8208;catalyst design for alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling methods development with sustainable iron catalysis.

         <title>Structurally Compact Penta(N,N&#8208;diphenylamino)corannulene as Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a downsizing strategy by combining a dynamic bowl&#8208;shaped core with smaller DPA groups to fabricate structurally compact HTMs. The unique structure of the HTMs facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, efficient film formation, and charge transport, resulting in enhanced charge mobility and glass transition temperature. Consequently, the PSC employing the dopant&#8208;free HTM exhibits an impressive PCE of 24.01&#8201;% along with exceptional operational stability, retaining 96&#8201;% of its initial performance after 800&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are essential for improving the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we have designed and synthesized a novel organic small molecule HTM, cor&#8208;(DPA)5, characterized by a bowl&#8208;shaped core with symmetric five diphenylamine groups. Compared to already&#8208;known HTMs, the bowl&#8208;shaped and relatively compact structure of cor&#8208;(DPA)5 facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, promotes film formations, and enhances charge transport. Consequently, the cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5 HTM exhibits high charge mobility, exceptional hydrophobicity, and a significantly elevated glass transition temperature. Superior to previously reported HTMs such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and cor&#8208;OMePTPA, our newly synthesized cor&#8208;(DPA)5 HTM is free from any ionic dopants. As a result, the dopant&#8208;free cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5&#8208;based PSC demonstrates an impressive efficiency of 24.01&#8201;%, and exhibits outstanding operational stability. It retains 96&#8201;% after continuous exposure to 1 sun irradiation for 800&#8197;hours under MPP (maximum power point) tracking in ambient air. These findings present a structurally compact novel HTM and exemplify a new approach to the molecular design of HTM for the development of stable and effective PSCs.

         <title>The Operando Nature of Isobutene Adsorbed in Zeolite H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 Unraveled by Machine Learning Potentials Beyond DFT Accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transfer learning approach is proposed to perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations with arbitrary accuracy. We study the chemisorption of isobutene in the H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 zeolite with RI&#8208;RPA and show that carbenium ions are not present in significant concentrations at reaction temperatures.







Abstract
Unraveling the nature of adsorbed olefins in zeolites is crucial to understand numerous zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. A well&#8208;grounded theoretical description critically depends on both an accurate determination of the potential energy surface (PES) and a reliable account of entropic effects at operating conditions. Herein, we propose a transfer learning approach to perform random phase approximation (RPA) quality enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, thereby approaching chemical accuracy on both the determination and exploration of the PES. The proposed methodology is used to investigate isobutene adsorption in H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 as prototypical system to estimate the relative stability of physisorbed olefins, carbenium ions and surface alkoxide species (SAS) in Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic zeolites. We show that the tert&#8208;butyl carbenium ion formation is highly endothermic and no entropic stabilization is observed compared to the physisorbed complex within H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13. Hence, its predicted concentration and lifetime are negligible, making a direct experimental observation unlikely. Yet, it remains a shallow minimum on the free energy surface over the whole considered temperature range (273&#8211;873&#8197;K), being therefore a short&#8208;lived reaction intermediate rather than a transition state species.

         <title>Stereoregular Poly(Phenyl Glycidyl Ethers): In Situ Formation of a Polyether Stereocomplex from a Racemic Monomer Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;derived phenyl glycidyl ethers reveals the first in situ polyether stereocomplex formation without prior kinetic resolution of the enantiopure building blocks. Capitalizing on highly active bimetallic cobalt complexes, enantioselective ROP generates a single, enantiomeric polyether stereoisomer. Using isoselective ROP, a mixture of highly stereoregular, isotactic polyether chains of opposite chirality is generated. The substitution pattern of the phenyl glycidyl ethers not only has a dramatic impact on the thermal properties of these isotactic polyethers, but also controls the stereocomplexation of the resulting stereoisomer blends.







Abstract
Polymer stereocomplex formation represents a promising research area as it can improve thermal and mechanical properties of co&#8208;crystallized polymer strands of opposite chirality. Polymers that form stereocomplexes commonly feature high stereoregularity and usually require sourcing from enantiopure monomer building blocks. Herein, we report the in situ polyether stereocomplex formation from racemic epoxide monomers, i.e., substituted methyl phenyl glycidyl ethers. The bio&#8208;renewable glycidyl ethers were explored in both enantio&#8208; and isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (ROPs), resulting in isotactic poly(phenyl glycidyl ether). While the enantioselective ROP selectively resolves a single enantiomeric, isotactic polyether stereoisomer ([mm]P&#8805;78&#8201;%), the isoselective ROP leads to the concurrent formation of both isotactic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;poly(phenyl glycidyl ether) stereoisomers ([mm]P&#8805;92&#8201;%) and thus results directly in a stereoisomer blend, which forms a stereocomplex. This is one of only a few polymer stereocomplexes generated directly during polymerization from a racemic monomer mixture. Stereocomplexes of the different poly(phenyl glycidyl ether)s show an increase in melting temperature of up to 76&#8201;&#176;C, relative to the enantiopure parent polymers. The position of the methyl group at the phenyl ring determines both stereocomplex formation and the thermal properties of the resulting materials.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Vanadium&#8208;Induced Ru&#8208;V Dual Active Sites Enable Exceptional Performance for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating atomically dispersed vanadium species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms into RuO2 lattices, enable exceptional activity and stability for acidic water oxidation. The produced Ru&#8722;V dual active sites with optimized interatomic distance induce a switch from the traditional AEM to the OCM pathway, and the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;V local structures stabilize the surface Ru active sites, synergistically boosting the acidic OER performance.







Abstract
Regulating the catalytic reaction pathway to essentially break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off that limits RuO2 and thus achieves exceptional stability and activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important yet challenging. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of incorporating atomically dispersed V species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms, into RuO2 lattices to trigger direct O&#8722;O radical coupling to release O2 without the generation of *OOH intermediates. Vn&#8722;RuO2 showed high activity with a low overpotential of 227&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during a 1050&#8197;h test in acidic electrolyte. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that compared with the V single atom&#8208;doping case, the introduction of the V dimer into RuO2 further decreases the Ru&#8208;V atomic distance and weakens the adsorption strength of the *O intermediate to the active V site, which supports the more energetically favorable oxygen radical coupling mechanism (OCM). Furthermore, the highly asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;V local structure stabilizes the surface Ru active center by lowering the valence state and increasing the resistance against overoxidation, which result in outstanding stability. This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 by atomically dispersed species modification.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Mimetic MoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Triggering Oxidative Stress Cascade Amplification for High&#8208;Efficiency Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with multiple catalytic active sites can generate various reactive oxygen species, deplete glutathione, and block glutathione regeneration by consuming NADPH, thereby triggering oxidative stress cascade amplification for collaborative catalytic therapy. The antitumor therapeutic effect is further enhanced when synergized with photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency have been extensively applied in reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. However, the high energy barriers of reaction intermediates on single&#8208;atom sites and the overexpressed antioxidants in the tumor microenvironment restrict the amplification of tumor oxidative stress, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with various catalytic active sites, which exhibits peroxidase, oxidase, glutathione (GSH) oxidase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mimicking activities. Compared with Mo SAzyme, the introduction of Cu atoms, formation of dual&#8208;atom sites, and synergetic catalytic effects among various active sites enhance substrate adsorption and reduce the energy barrier, thereby endowing MoCu DAzyme with stronger catalytic activities. Benefiting from the above enzyme&#8208;like activities, MoCu DAzyme can not only generate multiple ROS, but also deplete GSH and block its regeneration to trigger the cascade amplification of oxidative stress. Additionally, the strong optical absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II bio&#8208;window endows MoCu DAzyme with remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Consequently, MoCu DAzyme achieves high&#8208;efficiency synergistic cancer treatment incorporating collaborative catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy. This work will advance the therapeutic applications of DAzymes and provide valuable insights for nanocatalytic cancer therapy.

         <title>Sulfate Derivatives with Heteroleptic Tetrahedra: New Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Birefringent Materials in which Weak Interactions Modulate Functional Module Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;ultraviolet birefringent materials in which weak interactions modulate functional module ordering. Following this strategy, new CN4H7SO3CF3 crystals show superior linear optical properties, including the shortest cutoff edge among reported guanidinium/aminoguanidinium&#8208;based compounds and the largest birefringence in the deep&#8208;ultraviolet region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep&#8208;UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, C(NH2)3SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CF3 were identified as high&#8208;performance candidates for deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials. The millimeter&#8208;sized crystals of CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CH3 were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200&#8197;nm. CN4H7SO3CF3 exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546&#8197;nm, 0.395 @ 200&#8197;nm) in the deep&#8208;UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Microporous Membrane for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;exchange membrane made from rigid polymers was developed for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. It shows high ion selectivity, suppressing the I2 cathode shuttle effect. Abundant sulfonate groups in the membrane ensure uniform Zn2+ flux on the anode. Additionally, the membrane's microporosity allows pre&#8208;adsorption of active materials, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the battery exhibits high stability and capacity over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining popularity due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and ease of manufacturing. However, challenges like polyiodide shuttle effect and Zn dendrite growth hinder their practical application. Here, we report a cation exchange membrane to simultaneously prevent the polyiodide shuttle effect and regulate Zn2+ deposition. Comprised of rigid polymers, this membrane shows superior swelling resistance and ion selectivity compared to commercial Nafion. The resulting Zn&#8722;I2 battery exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge rate of 4.47&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h rest. By directing a uniform Zn2+ flux, the membrane promotes a homogeneous electric field, resulting in a dendrite&#8208;free Zn surface. Moreover, its microporous structure enables pre&#8208;adsorption of additional active materials prior to battery assembly, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. At 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery exhibits a steady running for 10,000&#8197;cycles with capacity retention up to 96.1&#8201;%, demonstrating high durability of the membrane. The practicality of the membrane is validated via a high&#8208;loading (35&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) pouch cell with impressive cycling stability, paving a way for membrane design towards advanced Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>A Novel Anion Receptor Additive for &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C Sodium Metal Batteries by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium metal batteries have garnered significant attention. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester, is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations. The additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, forming a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries, known for their high theoretical specific capacity, abundant reserves, and promising low&#8208;temperature performance, have garnered significant attention. However, the large ionic radius of Na+ and sluggish transport kinetics across the interfacial structure hinder their practical application. Previous reviews have rarely regulated electrolyte performance from the perspective of anions, as important components of the electrolyte, the regulation mechanism is not well understood. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester (ABAPE), is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations and accelerate Na+ transport kinetics. The results of theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with deep Ar&#8208;ion etching demonstrate that the introduction of this additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, reduces the desolvation barrier and forms a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF, effectively preventing the hydrolysis of NaPF6 and stabilizing acidic species. Consequently, the Na||Na symmetric cell exhibits excellent long&#8208;cycle performance of 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cell with the addition of ABAPE maintains a capacity retention of 84.29&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C after 1200&#8197;cycles and presents no capacity decay over 150&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Synergistic Photoredox/Palladium Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Racemic Heterobiaryl (Pseudo)Halides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synergistic photoredox/palladium catalysis was developed to realize the enantioconvergent carboxylation of racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides with CO2, affording a series of axially chiral esters in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Key to success was the utilization of an appropriate amount of alkyl bromide to trap the generated chiral carboxylic anion in situ towards the formation of conformationally stable ester.







Abstract
Herein, we report a synergistic photoredox/palladium catalytic system for the efficient enantioconvergent synthesis of axially chiral esters from racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides (bromides/triflates) with CO2 and alkyl bromides under mild conditions.

     alt="Synergistic Photoredox/Palladium Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Racemic Heterobiaryl (Pseudo)Halides with CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient synergistic photoredox/palladium catalysis was developed to realize the enantioconvergent carboxylation of racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, affording a series of axially chiral esters in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Key to success was the utilization of an appropriate amount of alkyl bromide to trap the generated chiral carboxylic anion in situ towards the formation of conformationally stable ester.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a synergistic photoredox/palladium catalytic system for the efficient enantioconvergent synthesis of axially chiral esters from racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides (bromides/triflates) with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and alkyl bromides under mild conditions. A wide range of axially chiral esters were obtained in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Detailed mechanistic studies unveiled that the ratio of photocatalyst and palladium catalyst exhibited significant impact on the chemo- and enantioselectivities of the reaction. Kinetic studies and control experiments supported the proposed mechanism involving cascade asymmetric carboxylation followed by S&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Nonflammable Fluorinated Electrolyte Realizing High Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Zn Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of low working voltage and Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolyte has been solved by using fluorinated solvents&#8208;based electrolyte. The reduced solvation capacity of fluorinated solvents promotes the incorporation of TFSI&#8722; into Zn2+ solvation shell, resulting in forming ZnF2&#8208;rich SEI layer. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant fluorinated solvents and PFPN additive, Zn&#8208;graphite cell exhibits long lifetime and high working voltage.







Abstract
Due to the low decomposition potential of H2O and its corrosive effect to Zn foil, the Zn metal battery with aqueous electrolytes operates within a narrow electrochemical window and exhibits low anode utilization ratio. Fluorinated carbonate ester, exhibiting low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, is suitable for constructing high&#8208;voltage batteries, yet its application in Zn metal battery has been scarcely explored. Herein, we propose an electrolyte based on fluorinated solvents and ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) additive, which exhibits a high decomposition voltage of 2.75&#8197;V in Zn batteries. The fluorinated carbonate esters possess non&#8208;flammability and exhibit reduced solvation capacity which in turn promotes the incorporation of anions into Zn2+ solvation shell. Consequently, an anion&#8208;derived interface layer is formed on Zn anode, aiding the compact and planar growth of deposited Zn. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell exhibits an impressive Zn utilization of 91&#8201;% for 140&#8197;h, a level seldom reported previously. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant solvents and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer formed by PFPN additive, the Zn//graphite dual&#8208;ions battery shows an extended cycling life of 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, an anode&#8208;free cell was constructed and stably operated for 100&#8197;cycles, with a notably high average discharge midpoint voltage of 1.84&#8197;V.

         <title>Karl Ziegler &#8211; Early Career of a Scientist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Karl Ziegler is still known today for his outstanding achievements in chemical research, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963. But who was the person behind this brilliant scientist? This article outlines Ziegler's biography. It describes his youth and study years in Marburg, his postdoctoral period and especially his role in the Nazi era.







Abstract
Karl Ziegler is considered one of the most outstanding chemists of the 20th century. In particular, his work on organometallic mixed catalysts, which allows the polymerization of ethylene at normal pressure, led to a revolution in plastics production and changed the everyday life of all mankind. In 1963, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work, together with Giulio Natta. This article focuses on Ziegler's early career, which has received little attention to date. It describes his youth and study years in Marburg, which partly coincide with the First World War. Subsequently, his postdoctoral period is examined, which led him via Marburg and Frankfurt to his first associate professorship in Heidelberg. Special attention is paid to his relationship to National Socialism, which he opposed. As a result, Ziegler experienced professional difficulties in the 1930s, such as repeated rejection when filling various professorships. His appointment as a full professor in Halle and his subsequent directorship at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung (Coal Research), where he finally achieved his greatest research achievement, are described in the following.

In response to the correspondence by Budzelaar et al. on the &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process,&#8221; a few control experiments were conducted. The results indicated that the formation of Heck&#8208;type products and cyclization products can not be solely rationalized based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed heteroarylation of alkenes followed by acid&#8208;mediated elimination/cyclization sequence.







Abstract
We recently reported the gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and chain&#8208;walking reactions, which utilize migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination steps in a catalytic fashion. Budzelaar et&#8197;al. in their correspondence state that these reactions proceed through gold&#8208;catalyzed alkene heteroarylation followed by acid&#8208;mediated elimination and cyclization sequence. In response to this correspondence, we have conducted some experiments which convinced us that the product formation solely can not be rationalized based on hetero&#8208;arylation of alkenes under ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis.

A series of MOF@PCC composites was synthesized through mechanochemical reactions, as reported by Hang Xing, Yu Fang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202416884). This strategic placement of PCCs on the MOF surface optimized the pore structure of the composites, while the incorporation of polar functional groups facilitated specific interactions with targeted gas molecules. By carefully aligning the aperture sizes of both PCCs and MOFs, a significant enhancement in gas adsorption capacities was obtained, leading to improved binary gas separation capabilities and expanding the potential applications of these composites.

         <dc:description>
A facile design strategy for exploring robust folded luminescent molecules using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole to bridge planar electron donors and acceptors is reported by Zujin Zhao et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202414488). The generated molecules possess a regular sandwich&#8208;structured confirmation like a rigid folded mortise and tenon structure, and display prominent thermally activated delayed fluorescence. They can function efficiently as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

Piano stool rhodium complexes, which are derived from helicene&#8208;indene proligands, can catalyse enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation leading to axially chiral biaryls in mostly high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Stereocontrolled synthesis of such complexes and their use in catalysis expresses an unusual sequence of central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer, as reported by Tereza Edlov&#225;, Irena G.

         <title>Transmembrane Ion Channels: From Natural to Artificial Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion channels play a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Their importance is multifaceted and spans multiple disciplines, including biology, medicine, and pharmacology. In this Review, we introduce natural channel proteins and their structural features, gating properties, and physiological functions. We also discuss bioinspired ion channels and their fabricating strategies, dynamic regulation, and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.

         <title>Renaissance of Chlorine Evolution Reaction: Emerging Theory and Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Chlorine (Cl2) is an important commodity produced via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anodes of chlor&#8211;alkali electrolyzers, for which precious metal&#8208;based catalysts have been used for over half a century. The last decade has seen dramatic advances in both theory and the discovery of new catalysts for the CER. This minireview provides an overview of the emerging theories and catalytic materials for the CER and suggests future directions.







Abstract
Chlorine (Cl2) is one of the most important commodity chemicals that has found widespread utility in chemical industry. Most Cl2 is currently produced via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anode of chlor&#8211;alkali electrolyzers, for which platinum group&#8208;metal (PGM)&#8208;based mixed metal oxides (MMOs) have been used for more than half a century. However, MMOs suffer from the use of expensive and scarce PGMs and face selectivity problems due to the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction. Over the last decade, the field of CER catalysis has seen dramatic advances in both the theory and discovery of new catalysts. Theoretical approaches have enabled a fundamental understanding of CER mechanisms and provided catalyst design principles. The exploration of new materials has led to the discovery of CER catalysts other than MMOs, including non&#8208;PGM oxides, atomically dispersed single&#8208;site catalysts, and organic molecules, with some of which following novel reaction pathways. This minireview provides an overview of the recent advances in CER electrocatalyst research and suggests future directions for this revitalized field.

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces, specifically with regard to the effects of confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation, is the focus of this Minireview. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation and achieve new practical applications.







Abstract
With the development of mechanophores, polymer mechanochemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for creating force&#8208;responsive materials with a variety of desired functions, ranging from color change to molecular release. However, it remains challenging to improve the efficiency of mechanochemical activation, especially for mechanophores embedded within polymer networks, which has profound implications for translating mechanochemical responses into materials&#8208;centered applications. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation. In this Minireview, we discuss and summarize recent progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces including surfaces/interfaces, polymer assemblies, and other nanostructures, specifically focusing on the effects of spatial confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation. We envision that combining confinement effects with advances in molecular and materials engineering will further improve the activation efficiency, capitalizing more fully on the potential of mechanophores toward practical applications.

         <title>Application of Hard and Soft Acid&#8208;base Theory to Construct Heterometallic Materials with Metal&#8208;oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic materials are favored for their diverse structures and enhanced functionality compared to monometallic counterparts. However, their development is often impeded by complex metal coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview showcases the application of Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory as a powerful tool to streamline the design and synthesis of heterometallic clusters and cluster&#8208;based frameworks. Additionally, it briefly explores the synergistic effects that these clusters impart on the properties of heterometallic materials, offering valuable insights for researchers seeking to harness their full potential.







Abstract
Heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials offer the potential to incorporate multiple functionalities, leveraging the aggregation effects of clusters and translating this heterogeneity and complexity into unexpected properties that are more than just the sum of their components. However, the rational construction of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials remains challenging due to the complexity of metal cation coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview provides insights into a general synthetic strategy based on Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory, summarizing its advantages in the designed synthesis of discrete heterometallic clusters (intracluster assembly) and infinite heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials (intercluster assembly). Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential to exploit the intrinsic properties of mixed components to achieve breakthroughs across a broad range of applications. The insights from this review are expected to drive the progress of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials in a controllable and predictable manner.

         <title>Fundamentals and Challenges of Ligand Modification in Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically reviewing the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios towards heterogeneous electrocatalysis, this work aims to propose methodological guidance from the preparation of ligand&#8208;modified catalysts and the regulation of interfacial properties, thus providing a potential protocol for promoting in&#8208;depth research and further applications of ligand&#8208;modified catalytic systems.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalytic materials in the energy field could promote the structural transformation from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable energy. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ligand modification is an effective way to regulate both electronic and steric structures of catalytic sites, thus paving a prospective avenue to design the interfacial structures of heterogeneous catalysts for energy conversion. Although great achievements have been obtained for the study and applications of heterogeneous ligand&#8208;modified catalysts, the systematical refinements of ligand modification strategies are still lacking. Here, we reviewed the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios by focusing on heterogeneous electrocatalysis. We elucidated the ligand&#8208;modified catalysts in detail from the perspectives of basic concepts, preparation, regulation of physicochemical properties of catalytic sites, and applications in different electrocatalysis. Notably, we bridged the electrocatalytic performance with the electronic/steric effects induced by ligand modification to gain intrinsic structure&#8208;performance relations. We also discussed the challenges and future perspectives of ligand modification strategies in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Actuation Performance and Versatility of Photothermally Driven Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to photochemical reactions, which are the conventional mechanisms used to actuate photomechanical crystals, both the photothermal effect and natural vibration allow all crystals to absorb light at higher speeds over a wider range of light wavelengths, from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared. These two novel mechanisms could advance the research on photomechanical crystals from the field of fundamental chemistry to engineering and applied research.







Abstract
Photomechanical crystals exhibit mechanical motion upon light irradiation and may thus find applications as actuators. Over the last decades, many photomechanical organic crystals have been developed, commonly via photochemical reactions, particularly photoisomerization. However, photochemical crystal actuation is associated with several drawbacks, including a limited number of available crystals, slow actuation speed (&lt;5&#8197;Hz), and narrow wavelength range (&lt;550&#8197;nm). Such constraints have hindered the widespread use of crystals as actuation materials. In this minireview, we focus on crystal actuation by employing more universal physical phenomena (the photothermal effect and photothermally resonated natural vibration) and quantitatively evaluate actuation performance. Both mechanisms, particularly the latter, outperformed conventional photomechanical crystal activation in terms of both speed (maximum: 1,350&#8197;Hz) and the useful wavelength range (ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared). The oscillation frequencies of the crystals exceeded those of polymers, efficiently filling the gap between soft and hard materials. Both the photothermal effect and natural vibration can actuate any crystal that absorbs light. These two versatile physical actuation mechanisms could expand 40&#8197;years of research on photomechanical crystals&#8212;which had been based on photochemical reactions&#8212;from the realm of chemistry into engineering and lead to their practical applications in actuators and soft robots.

         <title>Resolving Structures of Paramagnetic Systems in Chemistry and Materials Science by Solid&#8208;State NMR: The Revolving Power of Ultra&#8208;Fast MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) over 100&#8197;kHz has transformed solid&#8208;state NMR for biomolecules but struggled with paramagnetic powders due to rotor size and sensitivity issues. Advances now permit routine analysis of sensitive samples, enhancing spectral resolution and overcoming past limitations. This enables precise characterization of paramagnetic systems&#8242; structures and properties, crucial for catalysts and battery materials, demonstrated on various complex materials.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100+kHz) has revolutionized solid&#8208;state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast&#8208;spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, and are associated with low sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra&#8208;fast 100+kHz MAS allows site&#8208;specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. Combined with more reliable rotor materials and handling methods, this opens the way to the routine characterization of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb3+ complex, an air&#8208;sensitive homogeneous high&#8208;spin Fe2+ catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe2+/Mn2+/Mg2+ olivine&#8208;type cathode materials.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyl sulfoxonium ylides are presented as a new type of monoaryl axially chiral framework. To access this intriguing scaffold, a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed enantioselective iodoaminocyclization reaction of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides was developed. The optically enriched atropoisomers can be transformed into diverse chiral structures.







Abstract
Despite recent advancements in the catalytic generation of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. Herein, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Efficient Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines Using Formaldehyde as a Single&#8208;Carbon Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For Cy3 synthesis, single&#8208;carbon reagents have low atom efficiency owing to large molecular weights. A new atom&#8208;efficient method using formaldehyde, the simplest single&#8208;carbon reagent, is presented. In this method, symmetrical and unsymmetrical Cy3 derivatives could be synthesized by efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
Herein, we present an innovative and atom&#8208;efficient synthesis of trimethine cyanines (Cy3) using formaldehyde (FA) as a single&#8208;carbon reagent. The widespread application of Cy3 dyes in bioimaging and genomics/proteomics is often limited by synthetic routes plagued by low atom economy and substantial side&#8208;product formation. Through systematic investigation, we have developed a practical and efficient synthetic pathway for both symmetrical and unsymmetrical Cy3 derivatives, significantly minimizing resource utilization. Notably, this approach yields water as the by&#8208;product, in alignment with sustainable chemistry principles. Moreover, the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis facilitates the detection of intracellular FA levels, utilizing the fluorescence signal of Cy3 in live cells. It is also possible to detect endogenous FA in the intestinal tissues. We observed a significant decrease in FA in the small intestine of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mice as compared to healthy mice. This methodological advancement not only enhances the scope of fluorescent dye synthesis but also contributes to sustainable practices within chemical manufacturing, offering a significant leap forward in the development of environmentally friendly synthetic strategies.

         <title>Generation of Triplet States by Host&#8208;Stabilized Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for the Construction of Efficient Supramolecular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation efficiency and lifetime of triplet state can be clearly promoted by the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation, contributing to the fabrication of highly efficient photocatalytic system. The supramolecular photocatalyst exhibits excellent performance in catalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. It shows high catalytic performance in the photodegradation of lignin owing to the ultra&#8208;stable host&#8211;guest complexation.







Abstract
Promoting the generation of triplet states is essential for developing efficient photocatalytic systems. This research presents a novel approach of host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation via the combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent methods. The designed building block, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4(1,4)&#8208;dibenzene cyclohexaphane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;phenylpyridinium) chloride, features inherently stable through&#8208;space conjugation. When this block forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex with cucurbit[8]uril, the through&#8208;space conjugation is further stabilized within the confined cavity. Both the generation and lifetime of triplet state are significantly increased, resulting from the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation. Additionally, the ultrahigh binding constant of 6.58&#215;1014&#8197;M&#8722;1 ensures the persistence of host&#8208;stabilization effect. As a result, the host&#8211;guest complex acts as a highly efficient catalyst in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. In the photodegradation of lignin, a complex natural product, the host&#8211;guest complex also exhibits high efficiency, demonstrating its robustness. This line of research is anticipated to enrich the toolbox of supramolecular photochemistry and provide a strategy for fabricating efficient supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes in a 1,2&#8208;addition fashion, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity as well as deuterated stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes through regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8208;cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3&#8208;dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er. Application of this method to construction of axial stereogenicity and deuterated stereogenic center provided a wide range of multifunctional chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access. DFT calculations revealed the origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity as well as a unique oxidative cyclization mechanism for cobalt catalysis.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Regio-, Diastereo- and Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of 1,3-Dienes and Aldehydes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach for highly regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt-based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes in a 1,2-addition fashion, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity as well as deuterated stereogenic centers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3-dienes and aldehydes through regio- and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio- and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine-cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3-dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre-formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er. Application of this method to construction of axial stereogenicity and deuterated stereogenic center provided a wide range of multifunctional chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access. DFT calculations revealed the origin of regio- and stereoselectivity as well as a unique oxidative cyclization mechanism for cobalt catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Subnanometer Diameter Control in Nanotubes Self&#8208;Assembled via Consecutive Cyclization &#8211; Polymerization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the length of rod&#8208;shaped dinucleobase molecules allows fine control on the pore diameter of self&#8208;assembled nanotubes, which are produced by coupling cooperative noncovalent processes of different hierarchy and acting in orthogonal directions: Watson&#8211;Crick H&#8208;bonding macrocyclization and supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Tubular self&#8208;assembled architectures are highly appealing supramolecular objects that participate in diverse essential biological processes. Controlling with precision their dimensions, and in particular their pore diameter, is a key objective to develop the full applied potential of these structures. Here, using a strategy that relies on the controlled supramolecular polymerization of Watson&#8211;Crick H&#8208;bonded macrocycles, we target the assembly of 3 sets of nanotubes in which pore diameter is finely controlled from 1.8, to 3.2 and to 4.3&#8197;nm. This is simply done by elongating the oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) block placed in between guanine and cytosine nucleobases in the monomer. Moreover, this structural change leads to a gradual reduction in the chelate cooperativity of the cyclization process and, at the same time, to an enhancement in the tendency of the macrocycles to stack, which critically influences the coupling between these consecutive supramolecular processes.

Remarkable M&#246;bius aromatic character in the 4&#960;&#8208;electron cyclic conjugated system of an isolated 1,2&#8208;digermacyclobutadiene derivative was revealed by the experimental valence&#8208;electron&#8208;density&#8208;distribution (EDD) analysis and theoretical studies.







Abstract
We present the visualization of the experimental valence electron&#8208;density distribution (EDD) in the isolated 1,2&#8208;digermacyclobutadiene ring system, revealing the unique 4&#960; electron&#8208;delocalization on the four&#8208;membered Ge2C2 ring. A remarkably high M&#246;bius 4&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic character in the Ge2C2 ring can be suggested from theoretical calculations, in sharp contrast to the significant antiaromaticity of the all&#8208;carbon cyclobutadiene ring.

         <title>Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Sulfonylation of Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a photocatalytic approach that accommodates both cyclic and acyclic internal alkenes with diverse substitution patterns and electronic properties. Importantly, the obtained allylic sulfones can be readily diversified into a wide range of products, thus enabling formal alkene transposition and all&#8208;carbon quaternary center formation through the sequential C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Allylic sulfones are valuable motifs due to their medicinal and biological significance and their versatile chemical reactivities. While direct allylic C&#8722;H sulfonylation represents a straightforward and desirable approach, these methods are primarily restricted to terminal alkenes, leaving the engagement of the internal counterparts a formidable challenge.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Photon clusteroluminescence (with emission wavelength up to 688&#8197;nm) was achieved in small clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with only two isolated heteroatomic units through the efficient and n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation, which promotes the in vivo bioimaging of CLgens with excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single&#8208;photon excited long&#8208;wavelength (686&#8197;nm) and high&#8208;efficiency (29&#8201;%) CL, two&#8208;photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units. TSC stabilized in the aggregate state has been proven to realize efficient spatial electron delocalization similar to conventionally conjugated compounds. Encouraged by the excellent TPCL properties, two&#8208;photon imaging of blood vessels in vivo and biocompatibility verification utilizing CLgens are also achieved. This work illustrates the essential role of TSC in promoting nonlinear optical properties of CLgens and may facilitate further design and development of the next generation of bioprobes with excellent biocompatibility.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with p&#8208;Block Metals Surpass Transition&#8208;Metal Counterparts in the Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic potential of p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide, highlighting their superior performance over transition metals. The findings underscore the role of optimized p&#8208;p hybridization in enhancing electron transfer and reducing energy barriers, offering promising sustainable alternatives in catalytic applications.







Abstract
Growing interest in p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (PM&#8208;SACs) is driven by their low toxicity, economic viability, and transition metal&#8208;like catalytic properties. However, selection criteria for p&#8208;block single&#8208;atom species and catalytic mechanisms of PM&#8208;SACs remain unclear. This study explores the catalytic abilities of PM&#8208;SACs and their transition metal counterparts (TM&#8208;SACs) based on polymetric carbon nitride (PCN) for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Using thermodynamic barriers as a key descriptor, it was found that PM&#8208;SACs can surpass TM&#8208;SACs in H2O2 production due to a lower energy barrier for *OOH intermediate formation resulting from optimized p&#8208;p hybridization. Specifically, Sb&#8208;SAC based on PCN shows the highest apparent quantum yield of 35.3&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm.

     alt="Single-Atom Catalysts with p-Block Metals Surpass Transition-Metal Counterparts in the Photocatalytic H2O2 Production"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explores the catalytic potential of p-block metal single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide, highlighting their superior performance over transition metals. The findings underscore the role of optimized p-p hybridization in enhancing electron transfer and reducing energy barriers, offering promising sustainable alternatives in catalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing interest in p-block metal single-atom catalysts (PM-SACs) is driven by their low toxicity, economic viability, and transition metal-like catalytic properties. However, selection criteria for p-block single-atom species and catalytic mechanisms of PM-SACs remain unclear. This study explores the catalytic abilities of PM-SACs and their transition metal counterparts (TM-SACs) based on polymetric carbon nitride (PCN) for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production. Using thermodynamic barriers as a key descriptor, it was found that PM-SACs can surpass TM-SACs in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production due to a lower energy barrier for *OOH intermediate formation resulting from optimized p-p hybridization. Specifically, Sb-SAC based on PCN shows the highest apparent quantum yield of 35.3&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. This study offers a rationale for the utilization of p-block SACs in the context of sustainable chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Partitioning / Self&#8208;assembly of Artificial Water Channels &#8211; Toward Controlled Permselectivity through Bilayer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Cycloalkyl imidazole dimers have been used to generate biomimetic water channels through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with superior water net permeability as well as ion rejection. This work will bring more possibilities for the design of artificial water channels with attached cycloalkyl components, and further may have applications in practical membrane support for water treatment.







Abstract
Artificial water channels (AWCs) have been extensively explored to mimic natural proteins, which enables to effectively transport water while blocking ions. As one of the first AWCs, self&#8208;assembled I&#8208;quartets (HCx) have showcased high water&#8208;permselectivity that can be enhanced by improving their distribution and stability within membrane. The use of long alkyl chains (n&gt;8) is constrained by their low solubility and aggregation. Herein, we considered cycloalkyl moieties, explored for the increase of the solubility favoring enhanced partition and/ for their self&#8208;assembly behaviors resulting the formation of effective stable water&#8208;channels with increased water permeability in bilayer membranes. This class of cycloalkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole amphiphilic (CxUH) channel could serve as a new reference for the effective design of self&#8208;assembled artificial water channels, it may give rise to the applications in desalination or in water treatment.

LAMP&#8208;MS integrates linear amplification with quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry. Using LAMP&#8208;MS, we could visually distinguish 5&#8197;mC stoichiometries in cfDNA samples from healthy individuals and CRC patients.







Abstract
Enhancing the effectiveness of utilizing circulating cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) for disease screening remains a challenge, necessitating improved sensitivity, specificity, cost&#8208;efficiency, and patient adherence. We present here LAMP&#8208;MS, an innovative technology that integrates linear amplification with single&#8208;base quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry on silicon chips. This approach overcomes several limitations in utilizing cfDNA 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) status for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. LAMP&#8208;MS enables unbiased amplification of as little as 1&#8197;ng of cfDNA, site&#8208;specifically quantify methylation levels of multiple 5&#8197;mC sites, thereby facilitating cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution quantitative detection of cfDNA methylation markers. We have validated the accuracy of DNA methylation determination using DNA probes and cfDNA from patient plasma samples, confirmed by mass spectrometric peak areas. Additionally, we have further shown this Mass Array technology could be expanded to also quantify RNA m6A modification sites. Combining the ability to work with ultra&#8208;low input materials and a visually interpretable output, LAMP&#8208;MS stands out as a promising method for real&#8208;world applications in clinics and laboratories for nucleic acid methylation detection and quantification.

         <title>Promoting Water Dissociation and Weakening Active Hydrogen Adsorption to Boost the Hydrogen Transfer Reaction over a Cu&#8722;Ag Superlattice Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of H*(H2O)x as a mediator is proposed to deliver a hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) pathway for overcoming the traditional scaling relationship for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) using H2O. A Cu&#8722;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure (sl&#8208;CuAg) site is then designed to enhance water dissociation while ensuring weak *H adsorption at the active site to enable the HTR mechanism. This material could be utilized in acetylene semihydrogenation to ethylene to simultaneously increase its activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The prerequisite for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) is H2O splitting to form surface hydrogen species (*H), which occupy catalytic sites and lead to mismatched coverage of *H and reactants, resulting in unsatisfactory activity and selectivity. Thus, modulating the splitting pathway of H2O is significant for optimizing the EHR process. Herein, a Cu&#8722;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure of staggered&#8208;ordered Cu and Ag is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to undergo a pathway for H2O splitting called the hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) in the water layer, which involves the formation of *H, the capture of *H by a water cluster to form H*(H2O)x and subsequent hydrogenation reactions by H*(H2O)x. Taking acetylene hydrogenation as a model case, the as&#8208;proposed HTR pathway could lead to a relaxation hydrogenation process to modulate the matching degree of C2H2 and *H, thus enabling a 91.2&#8201;% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency at a partial current density of 0.38&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, greatly outperforming its counterpart without a superlattice structure.

         <title>Red Blood Cell&#8208;Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Inhibit Influenza Virus through Surface&#8208;Displayed Sialic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) inhibit influenza virus infection by binding to the viral hemagglutinin (HA) via surface&#8208;displayed sialic acids (SAs). Acting as nanodecoys, RBC sEVs prevent viral attachment to host cells, effectively blocking infection. Removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly reduces their antiviral efficacy, highlighting the importance of SA&#8208;HA binding.







Abstract
Disrupting the conserved multivalent binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on influenza A virus (IAV) to sialic acids (SAs) on the host cell membrane offers a robust strategy to block viral attachment and infection, irrespective of antigenic evolution or drug resistance. In this study, we exploit red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) as nanodecoys by harnessing their high abundance of surface&#8208;displayed SAs to interact with IAV through multivalent HA&#8208;SA interactions. This high&#8208;avidity binding inhibits viral adhesion to the cell surface, effectively preventing both attachment and infection in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. Notably, enzymatic removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly diminishes their anti&#8208;IAV efficacy. Our findings indicate that RBC sEVs possess intrinsic anti&#8208;IAV properties due to their native multivalent SAs and hold considerable promise as antiviral therapeutics.

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation of CO2 by Atomically Precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ Clusters into a Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report an atomically precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ cluster with a highly robust structure that can catalyze the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine to synthesize benzimidazole and can further react with Zn(NO3)2 for the feasible synthesis of a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
By highly efficient ligand&#8208;exchange strategy, atomically precise Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ (PPh3=triphenylphosphine) cluster can be transformed into a Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ (DPPF=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) cluster that can maintain the atomic&#8208;packing structure but overcome the lability of Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+. Catalytic evaluation for the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine demonstrates that the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst can remarkably enhance both activity and stability compared to the Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ catalyst. More notably, the direct construction of a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (2D MOF) can be elaborately accomplished in the formylation process of o&#8208;phenylenediamine, CO2 and H2 with zinc nitrate enabled by the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst. The 2D MOF further enables the capture and transformation of CO2 to combine in the organic synthesis with epoxides under mild conditions. This work provides opportunities for creating highly active cluster sites for the chemical recycling of CO2.

         <title>Dinitrogen Reduction and Functionalization by a Siloxide Supported Thulium&#8208;Potassium Complex for the Formation of Ammonia or Hydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxide ligands promote dinitrogen (N2) reduction by Tm(II) ions yielding an N22&#8722; bridged complex that can be further reduced to yield a complex showing a rare triply reduced N23&#8722; radical bound by two Tm and three K cations, that facilitate N2 functionalization by electrophiles (H+, Me+) and N&#8722;C bond formation to yield an Me2N22&#8722; complex.







Abstract
The dinitrogen (N2) chemistry of lanthanides remains less developed compared to the d&#8208;block metals and lanthanide&#8208;promoted N2 functionalization chemistry in well&#8208;defined lanthanide complexes remains elusive. Here we report the synthesis and characterization (SQUID, EPR, DFT, X&#8208;Ray) of the siloxide supported heterobimetallic (Tm/K) complexes [{KTm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1) and [K3{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (2). Complex 2 provides a rare example of a metal complex of the triply reduced N23&#8722; radical. The structure of 2 differs from the few previously reported N23&#8722; complexes as it presents two Tm and three K cations binding the N23&#8722; radical, facilitating N2 functionalization. Notably, the K3Tm2&#8208;bound N23&#8722; moiety reacts with excess H+ to form NH4Cl in 18&#8201;% yield, and with MeOTf at room temperature to yield the dimethyl hydrazido complex [K2{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;(CH3)NN(CH3))] (3). Protonolysis of 3 yields MeHN&#8722;NMeH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HCl in 18&#8201;% yield.

         <title>High&#8208;Yielding Nanobelt Formation by Chirality&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis is used to create chiral and enantiopure annulated nanobelts from their chiral precursors via a one&#8208;pot self&#8208;condensation process in 84&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;persistent conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) are fascinating synthetic targets. However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation. Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in 84&#8201;% yield by applying chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were investigated by UV/Vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity of these structures is discussed.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Driven Aqueous&#8208;Phase Methane Conversions into Complex Molecules up to Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;Ray is capable of driving an aqueous&#8208;phase CH4+H2O+O2 conversion selectively into CH3COOH via &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH radical intermediates, and driving an aqueous&#8208;phase CH3COOH+NH3 conversion into NH2CH2COOH via &#8901;CH2COOH and &#8901;NH2 radical intermediates. Such &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase methane conversions probably play an important role in the formation network of complex organic molecules in the universe, and provides a strategy to convert abundant CH4 into value&#8208;added products at mild conditions.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of initial evolutions of molecules in the universe is of great interest and importance. CH4 is one of the abundant simple molecules in the universe. Herein we report &#947;&#8208;ray, high&#8208;energy photons commonly existing in cosmic rays and unstable isotope decay, as an external energy to efficiently drives aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions to various products with the presence of oxygen at room temperature. Glycine also forms with an additional introduction of ammonia. Both CH4 conversions and product distributions are modified by solid granules, and a CH3COOH selectivity as high as 82&#8201;% is obtained when SiO2 is added. Our results point to &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions as a likely formation network of initial complex organic compounds in the universe and offer an alternative strategy for efficiently utilizing CH4 as the carbon source to produce value&#8208;added products at mild conditions, a long&#8208;standing challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis.

Our results point to &#947;-ray driven aqueous-phase CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversions as a likely formation network of initial complex organic compounds in the universe and offer an alternative strategy for efficiently utilizing CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the carbon source to produce value-added products at mild conditions, a long-standing challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C Single Atoms into Highly Efficient MOOH Nanoclusters during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activation and aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C (M=Ni, Fe, and Co) single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are demonstrated. In this process, both N and supported carbon are severely oxidized, leading to the destruction of M&#8722;N bonds. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism, the isolated M atoms finally aggregate to form MOOH nanoclusters. MOOH nanoclusters with a carbon support are responsible for the enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites. However, the oxidative structural evolution of coordinated N during the OER will probably damage the structure of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, hence resulting in a completely different reaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials during the alkaline OER. Taking Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C as an example, multiple characterizations show that the coordinated N on the surface of Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C is almost completely dissolved in the form of NO3&#8722;, accompanied by the generation of abundant O functional groups on the surface of the carbon support. Accordingly, the Ni&#8722;N bonds are broken. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism and further oxidation, the isolated Ni atoms are finally converted to NiOOH nanoclusters supported by carbon as the real active sites for the enhanced OER. Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C also have similar aggregation mechanism. Our findings provide unique insight into the structural evolution and activity origin of M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based catalysts under electrooxidative conditions.

         <title>Gold Coordination&#8208;Accelerated Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emission for Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible Ultrapure Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient solution&#8208;processed ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been achieved using non&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance emitters. The coordination with two gold&#8208;carbene moieties leads to significantly accelerated thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Meanwhile, the color purity and emission efficiencies of the parental B/N based polycyclic core are essentially unaffected by the gold coordination.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) type emitters have emerged as highly promising candidates for high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions with simultaneous short excited state lifetimes and ultrapure blue color (a CIEy close to 0.046 and an emission peak &gt;440&#8197;nm) have rarely been obtained for MR emitters. Herein, we report a design of dual gold&#8208;coordinated MR molecules to achieve efficient and short&#8208;lived ultrapure blue TADF emission. The dinuclear Au(I) complex, namely iPrAuBN, shows a narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with a peak maximum of 448&#8197;nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm in doped film. The coordination with two Au atoms significantly shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime to 7.8&#8197;&#956;s in comparison to 60.6&#8197;&#956;s for the parental organic analogue. Solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with iPrAuBN demonstrates an ultrapure blue electroluminescence with a peak maximum of 442&#8197;nm, a FWHM of 19&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.154, 0.036), and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Mechanochromic Displays Based on Photoswitchable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>

Mechanochromic intricate pictures with striking structural colors are imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive optical materials are attractive for many areas, from healthcare to art design. However, creating intricate color&#8208;changing patterns for visual information is still a challenge. This work describes the preparation of mechanochromic structural colored intricate pictures imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch. The photoswitch contains a photoisomerizable cinnamate moiety and was incorporated in a main chain liquid crystal oligomer with photopolymerizable acrylate end groups. After coating, the structural colored film was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in air causing E/Z isomerization of the cinnamate units leading to a redshift of the structural color of the film. A grayscale photomask was used to spatially control the photoisomerization reaction and imprint colorful pictures such as portraits and landscapes, in the cholesteric liquid crystal films with high resolution. Photopolymerization in a nitrogen atmosphere led to a mechanochromic cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer with striking structural colors that blueshift upon strain. The sharp details of the patterns were preserved even under deformation and the system returned to the initial state upon strain removal. Our work offers a simple photoswitch approach to prepare stimuli responsive optical polymers imprinted with color&#8208;changing pictures of unprecedented complexity.

         <dc:description>
Novel efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with regular folded sandwich configurations are constructed using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They can function efficiently as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high electroluminescence efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Constructing folded molecular structures is emerging as a promising strategy to develop efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Most folded TADF materials have V&#8208;shaped configurations formed by donors and acceptors linked on carbazole or fluorene bridges. In this work, a facile molecular design strategy is proposed for exploring sandwich&#8208;structured molecules, and a series of novel and robust TADF materials with regular U&#8208;shaped sandwich conformations are constructed by using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They hold outstanding thermal stability with ultrahigh decomposition temperatures (556&#8211;563&#8201;&#176;C), and exhibit fast delayed fluorescence and excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (86&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;%). The regular and close stacking of acceptor and donors results in rigidified molecular structures with efficient through&#8208;space interaction, which are conducive to suppressing intramolecular motion and reducing reorganized excited&#8208;state energy. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using them as emitters exhibit excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%, which is a leading value for the OLEDs based on folded TADF emitters. These results demonstrate the proposed strategy of employing 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge for planar donors and acceptors to construct efficient folded TADF materials is applicable.

         <title>Direct C3&#8722;H Alkylation and Alkenylation of Quinolines with Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, direct alkylation and alkenylation at the C3&#8722;H position of a wide array of quinoline precursors remain challenging. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under redox&#8208;neutral and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of quinoline C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;C bonds is essential for obtaining the enormous array of derivatives required for pharmaceutical and agrochemical development. Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, direct alkylation and alkenylation at C3&#8722;H positions in a wide array of quinoline precursors remain predominantly challenging and elusive. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, all achieved under redox&#8208;neutral and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The method involves a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot or two&#8208;pot sequence, including 1,4&#8208;dearomative addition, functionalization at C3, and elimination or transalkylation to produce 3&#8208;alkylated/alkenylated quinolines. The presence of a carbonyl group in these products allows for further synthetic manipulations, enabling the production of cyanides, amides, amines, and simple alkyl derivatives.

         <dc:description>Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization has attracted considerable attention as a pathway to late&#8208;stage modification of peptides. Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including an unprecedented example of C&#8211;H arylation of an internal residue. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8211;H functionalization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomodulated Transient Catalytic Constitutional Dynamic Networks and Reaction Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to photomodulate dynamically transient DNA&#8208;based reaction circuits and networks is introduced. The method relies on the integration of photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;phosphate ester&#8208;caged DNA hairpin with a &#8220;mute&#8221; reaction module. Photodeprotection (&#955; = 365 nm) of the hairpin structure separates a fuel strand triggering the dynamic, transient, operation of the DNA circuit/network. By temporal photocleavage of the hairpin within the course of transient operation of the circuit, photomodulation of the systems are demonstrated. The modulation amplitude and rhythms are controlled by the time&#8208;interval and cycle numbers of photo&#8208;deprotecting the hairpin structure. The method is applied to transiently photomodulate the catalytic activities of a DNAzyme, enabling the photomodulation of the transient assembly of a constitutional dynamic network (CDN) and the transient reconfiguration of the CDN framework. The different systems are supported by computational kinetic models allowing to predict, and experimentally validate, the behavior of the systems under variable auxiliary conditions. Moreover, the photomodulated transient CDNs are implemented as functional frameworks guiding the thrombin&#8208;catalyzed coagulation of fibrinogen to fibrin (fibrinogenesis) and photomodulated operation of a biocatalytic cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Twisted Conformational Changes in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Host&#8208;Guest Systems: Theoretical Modeling and Chiroptical Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel equations based on the mass&#8208;balance model were applied to analyze 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems for achiral and chiral host molecules with left&#8208; and right&#8208;twisted conformations (HM and HP) and chiral and achiral guest molecules (GX). Theoretical analysis for the variable temperature circular dichroism (VT&#8722;CD) experiments resulted in the successful determination of the thermodynamic parameters, equilibrium constants (K), and molar CD values.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance chiral materials is to design and synthesize host molecules with left&#8208; and right&#8208; (M&#8208; and P&#8208;)twisted conformations and to control their twisted conformations. For this, a quantitative analysis is required to describe the chiroptical inversion, chiral transfer, and chiral recognition in the host&#8208;guest systems, which is generally performed using circular dichroism (CD) and/or proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8197;NMR) spectroscopies. However, the mass&#8208;balance model that considers the M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations has not yet been established. In this study, we derived the novel equations based on the mass&#8208;balance model for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems. Then, we further applied them to analyze the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems for the achiral calixarene&#8208;based capsule molecule, achiral dimeric zinc porphyrin tweezer molecule, and chiral pillar[5]arene with the chiral and/or achiral guest molecules by using the data obtained from the CD titration, variable temperature CD (VT&#8722;CD), and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments. The thermodynamic parameters (&#916;H and &#916;S), equilibrium constants (K), and molar CD (&#916;&#1013;) in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems could be successfully determined by the theoretical analyses using the derived equations.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Micelle&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination for Accessing Unprotected Monofluorinated Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toxic organic solvents and electrolytes, traditionally indispensable for electro&#8208;organic synthesis, are now being reconsidered.&#160;In developing more sustainable electro&#8208;organic synthesis,&#160;we&#8217;ve harnessed the aqueous micelles as solvents and&#160;electrolyte&#8208;like structures when deformed under an electric field. The technology is showcased in synthetically highly valued hydrodefluorination reactions&#160;of difluorinated indoles. This mild electrosynthetic method produces monofluorinated unprotected indole scaffolds. Our approach minimizes waste and enhances atom economy, reducing reliance on expensive and hazardous&#160;solvents and electrolytes. The surfactant&#8217;s potential for recycling was verified for two cycles.&#160;Cyclic voltammetry analysis has corroborated that PS&#8208;750&#8208;M micelles in water establish a more efficient platform for hydrodefluorination.&#160;Our technology simplifies the production of monofluorinated indoles, which are crucial for many drug&#8208;like molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Zero&#8208;gap Electrolyzer Enables Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;free Seawater Splitting for Energy&#8208;saving Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;assisted direct seawater splitting (DSS) technologies are actively studied as a promising route to produce green hydrogen (H2), whereas the indispensable use of supporting electrolytes that help to extract water and provide electrochemically&#8208;accelerated reaction media results in a severe energy penalty, consuming up to 12.5% of energy input when using a typical KOH electrolyte. We bypass this issue by designing a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer configuration based on the integration of cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane assemblies, which protects stable DSS operation against the precipitates and corrosion in the absence of additional supporting electrolytes. The heterolytic water dissociation function of the bipolar membrane in&#8208;situ creates an asymmetric acidic&#8208;alkaline environment, kinetically facilitating H2 and O2 evolution reactions. When working in natural seawater without any chemical inputs, this zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer sustains nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency toward H2 for 120 h at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. With the high&#8208;integrity merit, our electrolyzer can be facilely scaled up into practical cell stacks with significantly increased active area and promising prospects for volume/space&#8208;sensitive application scenarios. This electrolyzer concept opens an underexplored design space for energy&#8208;saving H2 production from low&#8208;grade saline water sources, being complementary to, and potentially competitive with the pre&#8208;purification schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Decoupling Strategy for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries Free of Crosstalk Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crosstalk of transition metal ions between the metal oxide cathode and Zn anode restricts the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we propose a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) consisting of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the crosstalk of Mn2+, thus extending the lifespan of MnO2&#8208;based ZIBs. Experimental measurements and theoretical modelling verify that trimethyl phosphate (TMP) not only synergistically works with NH4Cl in the N&#8208;phase anolyte to enable fast Zn2+ conduction while block Mn2+ diffusion toward anode, but also modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress the dendrite formation and corrosion on Zn anode. Meanwhile, the A&#8208;phase catholyte effectively accelerates the cathode reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 cell&#160;delivers 80.13% capacity retention after 900 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1. This approach is applicable for other metal oxide cathode&#8208;based ZIBs, thereby opening a new avenue for developing ultrastable ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Secupyritines A&#8210;C, Three Natural Propellane Securinega Alkaloids: Structure Elucidation and Total Synthesis Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secupyritines A&#8210;C are unique polycyclic Securinega alkaloids isolated from medicinal plant Flueggea suffruticosa. They feature a distinctive 6/6/6/5/6 fused pentacyclic ring system with a highly strained 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;6&#8208;aza[4.4.3]propellane core. Their structures with absolute configurations were elucidated through a comprehensive approach involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and total synthesis. The total synthesis of secupyritines A&#8210;C was achieved in 14 or 16 steps, employing a synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks. Key elements of the synthetic procedures include a vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reaction to construct the sp3&#8210;sp2 attached&#8208;ring system, a Suzuki coupling reaction to build the piperidine ring, and an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction to establish the propellane skeleton. Formal asymmetric synthesis of secupyritines A&#8210;C was also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;driven Oxygen Vacancy Diffusion and Healing on TiO2(110) at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value&#8208;added energy sources. Here, we report in&#8208;situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We found that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five&#8208;fold&#8208;coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron&#8208;based ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2&#8208;driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Neutral Organic Radical Unveiled Solvent&#8208;Radical Interaction in Highly Reducing Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics is a key mechanistic debate when consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) is discussed in photoredox catalysis. In&#8208;situ generated organic photoactive radicals can access catalytic systems as reducing as alkaline metals that can activate remarkably stable bonds. However, in many cases, the extremely short&#8208;lived transient nature of these doublet state open&#8208;shell species has led to debatable mechanistic studies, hindering adoption and development. Herein, we document the use of an isolated and stable neutral organic nPrDMQA radical as a highly photoreducing species. The isolated radical offers a unique platform to investigate the mechanism behind the photocatalytic activity of organic photocatalyst radicals. The involvement of reduced solvent is observed, formed by single electron transfer (SET) between the short&#8208;lived excited state nPrDMQA radical and the solvent. In our detailed mechanistic studies, spectroscopic and chemical affirmation of solvent reduction is strongly evident. Reduction of aryl halides, including difluoroarenes is presented as a model study of the conPET method. Further, the activation of N2O, a greenhouse gas that is yet to be activated by photoredox catalysis, is showcased in the absence of a transition metal.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Restricted Macrocycles as Improved FKBP51 Inhibitors Enabled by Systematic Linker Derivatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles are increasingly considered as promising modalities to target challenging intracellular proteins. However, strategies for transitioning from active linear starting points to improved macrocycles are still underdeveloped. Here we explored the derivatization of linkers as an approach for macrocycle optimization. Using the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) as a model system we prepared &gt;140 macrocycles with systematically derivatized linkers. Two backbones were identified as promising frameworks for subsequent optimization. Surprisingly, co&#8208;crystal structure analyses revealed that these chemical templates represent an ensemble of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) conformations that can give rise to several distinct 3D&#8208;scaffolds. This resulted in a set of macrocycles with consistently improved affinity, plasma stability, and aqueous solubility compared to the linear precursors or the non&#8208;functionalized macrocycles. Our results highlight linkers as an opportunity for macrocyclic drug development, show how linker derivatization can improve the performance of macrocycles, and emphasizes the need to track macrocyclic scaffold evolution at a three&#8208;dimensional level.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Defects as Highly Active Sites for Gold Detection and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of precious metals (PMs) in many areas, such as printed circuit boards, catalysts, and target drugs, is increasing due to their unique physical and chemical properties, but their recovery remains a great challenge in terms of zero&#8208;valent PMs as final product. We report a highly hydrophilic carbon dot (CD) as reductant (electron donor), the defects in CD served as efficient active sites for zero&#8208;valent PMs recovery with an electron&#8208;donating capacity is ~1.7 mmol g&#8722;1. The reduction of gold follows a two&#8208;step dynamic model characterized by the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (initial rapid electron transfer process) followed by an Ostwald ripening process (subsequent slow process). Finite element method (FEM) simulation shows that the reaction efficiency and confinement effect of AuCl4&#8722; ions is positively correlated with defect density, indicating that the quantitative control of carbon defect density is the key to enhancing reduction activity. Combing with density functional theory (DFT) with XPS and FTIR technology, we found that the electron was transferred from CD to Au(III) via hydrogen bonding. This nano carbon material can be exploited to recover gold from e&#8208;waste water directly, with the characteristics of reducing energy consumption and avoiding environmental pollution.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Plasticity and Binding Affinity Enhancement Controlled by Linker Derivatization in Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles are abundantly used by nature to enable cell&#8208;permeable bioactive molecules. Synthetic non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also increasingly considered as modalities for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;bind proteins but guidelines for macrocyclization are only beginning to emerge. Macrocycles are thought to constrain the available conformations but also to allow for residual flexibility, the latter being poorly understood. Here we show that even medium&#8208;sized macrocycles display an unexpected high conformational plasticity, even when bound to their protein target. Minor modification of the linker region of macrocycles can shift the conformational ensemble to distinct conformational subclasses, each constituting distinct three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds for further optimization. This led to several new ligands with improved affinity and beneficial physicochemical parameters for the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51, a promising target for depression, obesity and chronic pain. Importantly, none of the beneficial modifications could have been identified by classical medicinal chemistry as they only work in the macrocyclic context.
Our results show that macrocyclization can do more than keeping loose ends together but rather provide a platform for multiple series of macrocycles with distinct binding modes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Isomeric Fulleropyrrolidines Enable Controlled Stacking of Perovskite Colloids for High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) has been severely hindered by the poor controllability of perovskite crystal growth and the energy level mismatch between the perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL). Here, we synthesized three cis&#8208;configured pyridyl&#8208;substituted fulleropyrrolidines (PPF), specifically 2&#8208;pyridyl (PPF2), 3&#8208;pyridyl (PPF3), and 4&#8208;pyridyl (PPF4), and utilized them as precursor additives to regulate the crystallization kinetics during film formation. The spatial distance between the two pyridine groups in PPF2, PPF3, and PPF4 increases sequentially, enabling PPF4 to interact with more perovskite colloidal particles. These interactions effectively enlarge the precursor colloid size and decelerate the crystallization rate of the perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality PPF4&#8208;based perovskite films with reduced defect density and lower exciton binding energy. Additionally, we incorporated a well&#8208;defined fullerene bis&#8208;adduct, C60BB, as an interlayer between the perovskite and PCBM layers to optimize energy level alignment. Through the synergistic effects of PPF4 and C60BB, our champion device achieved an efficiency of 16.05% (certified: 15.86%), surpassing the 16% efficiency bottleneck and setting a new benchmark for TPSCs. Moreover, the devices exhibited outstanding stability, retaining 99% of their initial efficiency after 600 hours of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Supramolecular Nanoarchitectonics for Simultaneous Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis in a Co&#8208;Assembly by a Biomimetic Isolation&#8208;Conduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of photoluminescence and photocatalysis have been achieved simultaneously in a co&#8208;assembly by a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy based on arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interactions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly has been exploited to build a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system for real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA) and photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Limited by the two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers, achieving photoluminescence and photocatalysis simultaneously is extremely challenging but essential for ever&#8208;growing complex issues and specialized scenarios. Here we proposed a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy induced by an arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interaction for enabling photoluminescence and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in the co&#8208;assembly of aromatic monomers and octafluoronapthalene (OFN). Inspired by the isolation&#8208;conduction effect of periodic isolation of myelin sheaths on the axons of vertebrate nerve fibers by node of Ranvier, we use OFN as a molecular isolator embedded in the aromatic monomers array to block the singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet pathway, while the enlarged intermolecular dipoles resulting from the A&#8722;P interactions facilitate the conduction of photogenerated carriers in the isolated regions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly exhibits an enhanced monomeric green emission compared to the corresponding monocomponent self&#8208;assembly with weak red emission. Meanwhile, it also has an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance with a rate of 2.45&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 15.2&#8197;times more than the self&#8208;assembled one. On this basis, a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system that includes real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids and photocatalytic HER device is constructed.

         <title>Decoupling H2 and O2 Release in Particulate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Using a Reversible O2 Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt) consisting of photoresponsive chip (HPCN), H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 ([Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+) is constructed to achieve the decoupling of particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes oxidize [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ into [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ and H+, while the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt through rGO for reduction of H+ to H2. Under visible irradiation, [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ is photolyzed back to [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ along with O2 evolution.







Abstract
H2 and O2 evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three&#8208;component photocatalyst, Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.

&lt;p&gt;Co(5&#8201;%)-HPCN/(rGO/Pt) consisting of photoresponsive chip (HPCN), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([Co(II)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is constructed to achieve the decoupling of particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes oxidize [Co(II)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into [Co(III)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, while the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt through rGO for reduction of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Under visible irradiation, [Co(III)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is photolyzed back to [Co(II)N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; along with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost-effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three-component photocatalyst, Co(5&#8201;%)-HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>P&#8208;Dopant with Spherical Anion for Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;TFSI/t&#8208;BP is the most widely utilized p&#8208;dopant for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, its nonuniformity of doping, along with the hygroscopicity and migration of dopants, results in the devices that exhibit limited stability and performance. This study reports the use of a spherical anion of the p&#8208;dopant, regulated by its radius and shape, as an alternative to the linear TFSI&#8722; anion. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the spherical anion significantly increases the doping of HTMs due to an enhanced electron transfer from larger dipoles. The enhanced transfer leads to a shift in the Pb&#8208;6p defect orbitals, resulting in the shallower trap states.&#160; The linear structure of the TFSI&#8722; anion, the p&#8208;dopant anion with a larger van der Waals radius and spherical shape offers increased hydrophobicity and migration barriers protecting the perovskite. The use of sodium tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoro methyl)phenyl)borate results in enhanced thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49% and 24.31% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values for organic dopants to date. This study underscores the ingenious design of spherical anions as p&#8208;dopants.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Stability&#8208;Activity Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electrocatalyst by Gallium Bilateral&#8208;Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy was developed to optimize the electronic environment of Mn&#8722;O and Ru&#8722;O in Ga/MnRuO2 by doping Ga to overcome the activity&#8208;stability restriction of bifunctional electrocatalysts and thus achieving the high bifunctional performance for ORR/OER and zinc&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
The rational design of metal oxide catalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is crucial for the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs). Precisely regulating the electronic environment of metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) active species is critical yet challenging for improving their activity and stability toward OER and ORR. Herein, we propose an atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy by introducing atomically dispersed Ga for continuously tuning the electronic environment of Ru&#8722;O and Mn&#8722;O in the Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst. The Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst breaks the stability&#8208;activity restriction, showing remarkable bifunctional performance with a low potential gap (&#916;E) of 0.605&#8197;V and super durability with negligible performance degradation (300,000 ORR cycles or 30,000 OER cycles). The theoretical calculations revealed that the strong coupling electron interactions between Ga and Ru&#8722;O/Mn&#8722;O tuned the valence state distribution of the metal center, effectively modulating the adsorption behavior of *O/*OH, thus optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the reaction barriers. The a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs based on Ga/MnRuO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance with a wide working temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C and a long lifetime of 2308&#8197;hours (i.e., 13,848&#8197;cycles) under a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Engineering of HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 Active Sites in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Enhanced (Photo)Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective ligand removal strategy was developed to engineer active catalytic sites of unsaturated HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, which significantly accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction by reducing the overpotential water adsorption from 0.31&#8197;V to 0.07&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Currently, lack of ways to engineer specific and well&#8208;defined active sites in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) limits our fundamental knowledge with respect to the mechanistic details for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we introduce the open metal sites into ZIFs through the selective ligand removal (SeLiRe) strategy, comprehensively characterize the altered structural and electronic features, and evaluate their role in HER. In situ electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of high&#8208;valence HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 sites through the binding of Zn&#8722;N2 with electrolyte hydroxide. The optimal OMS&#8208;ZIF exhibits a low overpotential of 0.41&#8197;V to achieve an ampere&#8208;level 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 120&#8208;hour stability. Theoretical simulations indicate that these active sites accelerate the water molecules activation kinetics, consequently enhancing the efficiency of the Volmer step. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy to introduce highly active catalytic sites in ZIFs, providing new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism in alkaline media.

         <title>Anionic Doping in Layered Transition Metal Chalcogenides for Robust Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of vacancies and lattice distortion induced by ionic doping in layered transition metal chalcogenides is elucidated as a key factor in enhancing charge transfer during the Li&#8722;S reaction, providing valuable insights for designing advanced cathode materials for next&#8208;generation sulfur&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic&#8208;doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8722;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance with 655&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, and near&#8208;integral cycle stability over 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is sustained at 0.1&#8197;C current rate, with 6.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 retained after 300&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic-doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8722;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium-doped, carbon-supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;x&lt;/sub&gt;@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X-ray absorption and in situ X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8722;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;x&lt;/sub&gt;@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance with 655&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;C, and near-integral cycle stability over 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a cathode capacity exceeding 8&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is sustained at 0.1&#8197;C current rate, with 6.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; retained after 300&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers Derived from Renewable Resources via Thiol&#8211;Ene Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green thiol&#8208;ene: A thiol&#8208;ene reaction was employed to synthesize functionalizable self&#8208;immolative polymers from monomers derived from renewable aldehydes. Depolymerization occurred through an alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization cascade after specific cleavage of responsive end&#8208;caps. The methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde&#8208;derived polymer were critical in providing efficient depolymerization yet high background stability.







Abstract
The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life or to achieve specific stimuli&#8208;responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self&#8208;immolative polymers based on lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes via a simple thiol&#8208;ene polymerization. These self&#8208;immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end&#8208;caps could be introduced through post&#8208;polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.

         <title>Hybrid Enzyme&#8208;Electrocatalyst Cascade Modified Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Methanol Formation from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of technologies for the conversion of excess atmospheric CO2, a hybrid electrocatalytic/bioelectrocatalytic system combining an inorganic catalyst with a bienzymatic cascade for CO2 electroreduction to methanol is presented. The Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 electrocatalyst enables the selective conversion of CO2 to formate. The generated formate is subsequently converted in a two&#8208;step process catalyzed by the two NADH&#8208;dependent enzymes, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, via formaldehyde to methanol. NADH regeneration is ensured by diaphorase wired to the electrode by a redox polymer.







Abstract
We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxidized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene&#8208;based low&#8208;potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using highly oxygen&#8208;sensitive formate dehydrogenases by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

         <title>Efficient Direct Air Capture in Industrial Cooling Towers Mediated by Electrochemical CO2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach to direct air capture. Widespread industrial cooling towers are demonstrated to be effective for direct CO2 capture from air using a buffered absorbent solution. The captured CO2 can be efficiently released at high purity via electrolysis in a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer operating at room temperature. The system exhibits stable performance over multiple cycles, highlighting its great potential for atmospheric CO2 removal.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising technology for mitigating global climate change but suffers from low efficiency, small scale, and high cost due to the dilute atmospheric CO2, limited size of air contactors, and heat&#8208;driven CO2 release. Here, we propose combining DAC with widely used industrial cooling towers to extract CO2 from the air and using electrolysis to release the captured CO2 at room temperature. We first prepare a buffered absorbent solution consisting of sodium glycinate, glycine, and sodium chloride for effective CO2 capture from the air, solving the incompatibility problem of the cooling towers with conventional absorbents. Next, we employ a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer for efficient release (&#8805;95&#8201;%) of the captured CO2 with high purity (&#8805;98&#8201;%) by constant current electrolysis at room temperature, bypassing the conventional energy&#8208;intensive heating process. The entire DAC system can operate stably for multiple cycles, and the mechanism for consecutive CO2 capture and release is uncovered. This work reveals the great potential of running DAC in industrial cooling towers coupled with electrochemically&#8208;driven CO2 release, opening up new avenues for curbing the increasingly severe climate change.

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF&#8208;active silver cluster exhibiting near&#8208;unity PLQY has been achieved through lattice modulation involving cation exchange followed by desolvation. The removal of the guest solvent via thermal activation in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformation fashion effectively controls the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting and surpasses both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay of the clusters, thereby boosting the PLQY from 12% to near&#8208;unity.







Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208; active silver cluster, achieving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12&#8201;% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lowers the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549&#8197;cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY is extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.

         <title>Towards Highly Stable Sn2+ Electrolyte for Aqueous Tin Batteries Using Hydroquinone Antioxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding antioxidant (hydroquinone) additives to acidic Sn2+ electrolyte, Sn2+ oxidation was suppressed due to the fact that hydroquinone is able to react with dissolved oxygen. Meanwhile, hydroquinone molecules tend to adsorb on electrode surface, resulted in refined deposition Sn particles and inhibition on dendrite growth. Finally, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% for Sn electrode can be obtained. This work can provide guidance for high stable Sn2+ electrolyte with high reversibility.







Abstract
Sn redox chemistry in aqueous acidic electrolyte was characterized with high reversibility and kinetics, which is considered as competitive anode material for aqueous batteries. Unfortunately, divalent Sn2+ is unstable in aqueous electrolyte. It was revealed that Sn2+ is easy to be oxidized to tetravalent Sn4+ by dissolved oxygen and then forms precipitate through hydrolysis process, leading to serious performance decay. Here, hydroquinone (HQ) was employed as antioxidant to prevent Sn2+ oxidation. With addition of HQ, Sn2+ electrolyte can maintain transparent and colorless after long&#8208;time exposure under air atmosphere, while large amounts of sediment were observed in the electrolyte without HQ. Moreover, HQ can adsorb on electrode surface to regulate Sn deposition and suppress Sn dendrite formation. With the difunctional HQ additive, Sn anode shows a stable cycling performance more than 1500 cycles with a high average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9&#8201;%. And the organic||Sn cell shows high cycling stability for 10,000 cycles with 71&#8201;% capacity retention. The hydroquinone antioxidant strategy provides a facile and cost&#8208;effective way to develop highly stable Sn2+&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Conditional Relay Activation of Theranostic Prodrug by Pretargeting Bioorthogonal Trigger and Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a click&#8208;photo&#8208;activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;conjugated SN&#8208;38 prodrug 1 with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.







Abstract
Bioorthogonalized light&#8208;responsive click&#8208;and&#8208;uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on&#8208;target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload in situ. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;&#8208;activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY conjugated SN&#8208;38 (1) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times&#8208;reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on 1 and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline&#8208;Free Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid using Electrochemically&#8208;Charged NixCo1&#8208;x(OH)2 as a Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Innate Immune Activation with Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers by leveraging the immune system to combat malignancies. However, its efficacy is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and other regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. Innate immune modulators (IIMs) provide potent immune activation to complement adaptive immune responses and help overcome resistance to ICB. This minireview provides an overview of IIMs and their roles in antitumor immune responses and summarizes recent advances in developing nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of IIMs to tumors for potentiating cancer immunotherapy and mitigating systemic toxicity. We discuss innovative nanoparticle platforms for the delivery of IIMs targeting the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes pathway, the toll&#8208;like receptor pathway, and the retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I&#8208;like receptor pathway. We review the preliminary clinical readouts of representative IIM nanoptherapeutics and highlight the development of multifunctional nanoparticles for combination treatments of IIMs with conventional treatment mdoalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynmic therapy, and tumor antigens. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from the existing systems, the challenges in the field, and future perspectives for this exciting field of nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of Hydrogen Migrations in the Taxadiene System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene is made by the taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene synthase (TxS) from Taxus brevifolia. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridines at the C4 Position via Metalation and Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N&#8208;atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N&#8208;atom within pyridines was overcome using&#160;n&#8208;butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4&#8208;position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4&#8208;sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4&#8208;H within 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N-atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N-atom within pyridines was overcome using&#160;n-butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4-position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4-sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross-coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late-stage installation of 4-pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4-H within 2,6-disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
