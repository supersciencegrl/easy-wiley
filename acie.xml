         <title>Mn&#8211;Ce Symbiosis: Nanozymes with Multiple Active Sites Facilitate Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Based on Electron Transfer and Confinement Anchoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating appropriate valence states of metal active centers, such as Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+, as well as surface vacancy defects, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of cerium&#8208;based and manganese&#8208;based nanozymes. Drawing inspiration from the efficient substance exchange in rhizobia&#8208;colonized root cells of legumes, we developed a symbiosis nanozyme system with rhizobia&#8208;like nano CeOx clusters robustly anchored onto root&#8208;like Mn3O4 nanosupports (CeOx/Mn3O4). The process of "substance exchange" between Ce and Mn atoms&#8212;reminiscent of electron transfer&#8212;not only fine&#8208;tunes the metal active sites to achieve optimal Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios but also enhances the vacancy ratio through interface defect engineering. Additionally, the confinement anchoring of CeOx on Mn3O4 ensures efficient electron transfer in catalytic reactions. The final CeOx/Mn3O4 nanozyme demonstrates potent catalase&#8208;like (CAT&#8208; like) and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like (SOD&#8208;like) activities, excelling in both chemical settings and cellular environments with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This research not only unveils a novel material adept at effectively eliminating ROS but also presents an innovative approach for amplifying nanozyme efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Self&#8208;antioxidant Capability and Processability of Additive&#8208;free MXene Ink towards High&#8208;performance Customizable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution processing of MXene ink is the feasible strategy to realize its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. Nevertheless, achieving high stability and processability of additive&#8208;free MXene ink is particularly challenging. Herein, we propose an oxyanion&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene ink that exhibits excellent self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability. The vertex&#8208;connected polyhedrons of oxyanions capping on the Ti3C2 host serve as an in&#8208;situ antioxidative shield, effectively preventing the attack of free H2O molecules while increasing the robustness of the Ti&#8211;C bond and reducing the susceptibility of surface Ti atoms to oxidation. Consequently, the shelf life of MXene ink can be extended up to 5 months at room temperature. Moreover, the high electron accumulation of oxyanions enhances the interlayer interactions among MXene sheets through electrostatic binding, which enables the formation of stable and uniform MXene inks with controlled rheological properties and processability. Inspired by Chinese calligraphy, we utilize the oxyanion&#8208;terminated MXene ink to fabricate high&#8208;performance and customizable paper supercapacitors, which exhibit exceptional flexibility and stability, allowing them to be tailored to desired capacity, stretchability, and shapes. This in&#8208;situ surface chemistry strategy of oxyanion can activate the self&#8208;antioxidant capability and solution processability of MXene, paving the way for its widespread applications in flexible and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>The Electrode/Electrolyte Interface Study during the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (CO2R) in acidic electrolytes has gained significant attention owing to higher carbon efficiency and stability than in alkaline counterparts. However, the proton source and the role of alkali cations for CO2R are still under debate. By using rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we find that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for CO2R even in acidic electrolytes. We also confirm that water molecules, rather than protons serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Additionally, the solvated CO2, or CO2(aq), is the actual reactant for CO2R. This study provides a deeper understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface during CO2R in acidic electrolytes and sheds light on further performance improvement of this system.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Materials with Ultrabright Phosphorescence at Room Temperature under Physiological Conditions for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the high efficiency of room temperature phosphorescence in crystal states, the generally utilized nanoparticles of organic materials in bioimaging demonstrated sharply decreased performance by orders of magnitude under physiological conditions, badly limiting the realization of their unique advantages. This case, especially for organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence materials, is not only the challenge present in reality but more importantly, for the theoretical problem of deeply understanding and avoiding the quenching effect by oxygen and water toward excited triplet states. Herein, thanks to the intelligent molecular design by the introduction of abundant hydrophobic chains and highly&#8208;branched structures, bright and persistent red/NIR phosphorescence under physiological conditions has been realized, which demonstrated the shielding effect towards oxygen, and strengthened the intermolecular interactions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative transitions. Accordingly, the record phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles in bioimage, up to 8.21 &#177; 0.36 &#215; 108 p s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 sr&#8722;1, was achieved, to realize the clear phosphorescence imaging of liver and tumors in living mice, even lymph nodes in rabbit models with high SBRs. This work afforded an efficient way to achieve the bright red/NIR phosphorescence nanoparticles, guiding their further applications in biology and medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8208;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100 h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8208;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8208;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8208;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Triggered Artificial DNAzyme Switches for Precise Manipulation of Cellular Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic molecular tools responsive to biological cues is crucial for advancing targeted cellular regulation. A significant challenge is the regulation of cellular processes in response to gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this, we present the design of Gas signaling molecule&#8208;Responsive Artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based Switches (GRAS) to manipulate cellular functions via H2S&#8208;sensitive synthetic DNAzymes. By incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to the phosphorothioate backbone, DNAzymes are strategically designed with H2S&#8208;responsive azide groups at cofactor binding locations within the catalytic core region. These modifications enable their activation through H2S&#8208;reducing decaging, thereby initiating substrate cleavage activity. Our approach allows for the flexible customization of various DNAzymes to regulate distinct cellular processes in diverse scenarios.  Intracellularly, the enzymatic activity of GRAS promotes H2S&#8208;induced cleavage of specific mRNA sequences, enabling targeted gene silencing and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, integrating GRAS with dynamic DNA assembly allows for grafting these functional switches onto cell surface receptors, facilitating H2S&#8208;triggered receptor dimerization. This extracellular activation transmits signals intracellularly to regulate cellular behaviors such as migration and proliferation. Collectively, synthetic switches are capable of rewiring cellular functions in response to gaseous cues, offering a promising avenue for advanced targeted cellular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugates for Targeted Delivery of Complementary Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugate (AOC) affords preferential cell targeting and enhanced cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO).&#160; Here, we have developed a modular AOC (MAOC) approach based on accurate self&#8208;assembly of separately prepared antibody and ASO modules. Homogeneous multimeric AOC with defined ASO&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio were generated by L&#8208;DNA scaffold mediated precise self&#8208;assembly of antibodies and ASOs. The MAOC approach has been implemented to deliver exon skipping ASOs via transferrin receptor (TfR1) mediated internalization. We discovered an anti&#8208;TfR1 sdAb that can greatly enhance nuclear delivery of ASOs. Cryo&#8208;EM structure of the sdAb&#8208;TfR1 complex showed a new epitope that does not overlap with the binding sites of endogenous TfR1 ligands. In vivo functional analyses of MAOCs with one ASO for single exon skipping and two ASOs for double exon skipping showed that both ASO concentration and exon skipping efficacy of MAOC in cardiac and skeletal muscles are dramatically higher than conventional ASOs in the transgenic Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse model. MAOC treatment was well tolerated in vivo and not associated with any toxicity&#8208;related morbidity or mortality. Collectively, our data suggest that the self&#8208;assembled MAOC is a viable option for broadening the therapeutic application of ASO via multi&#8208;specific targeting and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Metal&#8208;Ions Selectivity Induced by Intramolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Precise Heterometallic Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic supramolecules, known for their unique synergistic effects, have shown broad applications in photochemistry, host&#8208;guest chemistry, and catalysis. However, there are great challenges to precisely construct heterometallic supramolecules rather than statistical mixture, due to the limited metal&#8208;ions selectivity of coordination units. Especially, heterometallic architectures precisely encoding with different metal ions usually fail to obtain in one&#8208;pot method when only one type of coordinated motif exists due to its poor metal&#8208;ion selectivity. Herein, we proposed an effective intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; (IC&#960;) strategy and successfully constructed the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34 by one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of tritopic terpyridyl ligand L3 with Zn(II) and Cu(II), following the clear self&#8208;assembly mechanism that only thermodynamic dimers ZnL12 and Cu2L22 were constructed with model ligands L1, L2, Zn(II) and Cu(II) with perfect self&#8208;sorting and ultra&#8208;high metal&#8208;selectivity feature. The successful construction of the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34, encoding the definite sequence of metal ions Zn(II) and Cu(II) in one&#8208;pot method, will offer a novel approach to precisely construct heterometallic architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Anchored Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes hold promise for addressing key challenges in rechargeable zinc batteries (ZBs) utilizing aqueous electrolytes. However, achieving simultaneous high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and a high cation transference number while effectively suppressing Zn dendrites remains challenging. Herein, we design a novel polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and niobium pentoxide with oxygen vacancies (Nb2O5&#8208;x) with high ionic conductivity. PAN polymer matrix provides the electrolyte good mechanical properties and solubility of Zn salt. The high concentration of ZnCl2 effectively decouples the Zn2+ from polymer chain segments and provides more ionic conduction amorphous region. Moreover, incorporating Nb2O5&#8208;x filler accelerates Zn2+ desolvation by anchoring (ZnxCly)2x&#8208;y clusters and enhances the system's mechanical properties, achieving a superior Zn2+ transference number (~0.93) and interfacial stability. Consequently, the optimized PISSE demonstrates exceptional stability during prolonged cycling periods, wide temperature range operation (&#8208;40 &#8451; to 60 &#8451;), remarkable flexibility, and compatibility with diverse electrode materials. This study provides valuable insights into the design of solid&#8208;state electrolytes based on ZBs and elucidates their multifunctional prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence Switches through Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling multicolor persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) through photoirradiation holds fundamental significance but remains a significant challenge. In this study, we engineered a wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system utilizing the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer strategy. This system integrates a photoactivated long&#8208;lived luminescent material as the energy donor with a fluorescent photoswitch as the energy acceptor, facilitating programmable persistent luminescence switches. Distinct afterglow color states, such as initial nonemissive, green, yellow, and orange, were achieved through irradiation at 400 nm, 365 nm, and 254 nm, respectively. Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of this wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system in the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of multicolor afterglow images on a single thin film. This work represents a substantial step towards the fabrication of sophisticated wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive systems, potentially revolutionizing applications in optical data storage, security labeling, and smart displays by enabling precise control over photoresponsive behaviors under various photoirradiation wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Fe&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Quinone Networks for Mutually Enhanced Mild Photothermal Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mild photothermal therapy (MPTT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for attenuating thermal damage to the normal tissues surrounding tumors, while the heat&#8208;induced upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) greatly compromises the curative efficacy of MPTT by increasing cellular thermo&#8208;tolerance. Ferroptosis has been identified to suppress the overexpression of HSPs by the accumulation of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but is greatly restricted by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in tumor microenvironment and undesirable ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a synergistic strategy based on the mutual enhancement of MPTT and ferroptosis is proposed for cleaving HSPs to recover tumor cell sensitivity. A facile method for fabricating a series of Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs) by coordinated assembly is proposed and the representative FTP MQNs possess high photothermal conversion efficiency (69.3%). Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, FTP MQNs not only trigger effective MPTT to induce apoptosis but more significantly, potentiate Fenton reaction and marked GSH consumption to boost ferroptosis, and the reinforced ferroptosis effect in turn can alleviate the thermal resistance by declining the HSP70 defense and reducing ATP levels. This study provides a valuable rationale for constructing a large library of MQNs for achieving mutual enhancement of MPTT and ferroptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Cryptophycin Derivatives with Modification in Unit D for Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytotoxic payloads for drug conjugates suitable for directed tumor therapy need to be highly potent and require a functional group for conjugation with the homing device (antibody, peptide, or small molecule). Cryptophycins are cyclodepsipeptides that stand out from the realm of natural products due to their extraordinarily high cytotoxicity. However, the installation of a suitable conjugation handle without compromising the toxicity is highly challenging. The unit D, natively 2&#8208;hydroxyisocaproic acid (leucic acid), was envisaged as a promising attachment site based on structural information from X&#8208;ray analysis. A versatile, scalable and efficient synthetic route towards conjugable cryptophycins with modification in unit D was developed and an array of new cryptophycin analogues was synthesized. Several derivatives, especially those containing lipophilic groups with low steric demand such as alkylated amino groups, exhibit low picomolar cytotoxicity often combined with efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant tumor cells. The newly established cryptophycin analogues comprise a broad range of relevant functional groups used as conjugation handles, among them amino, hydroxy, carboxy, as well as sulfur&#8208;containing derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a tubulin&#8208;bound cryptophycin together with quantitative structure activity relationship manifested rationales for the synthesis of most potent cryptophycin derivatives and further confirmed the suitability of modifications in unit D.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Anode and Cathode Interphases via an Alum Electrolyte Additive for High&#8208;performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A zinc (Zn) metal anode paired with a vanadium oxide (VOx) cathode is a promising system for aqueous Zn&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs); however, side reactions proliferating on the Zn anode surface and the infinite dissolution of the VOx cathode destabilise the battery system. Here, we introduce a multi&#8208;functional additive into the ZnSO4 (ZS) electrolyte, KAl(SO4)2 (KASO), to synchronise the in&#8208;situ construction of the protective layer on the surface of the Zn anode and the VOx cathode. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron radiation have verified that the high&#8208;valence Al3+&#160;plays multifunctional&#160;roles of competing with Zn2+&#160;for solvation and forming a Zn&#8211;Al alloy layer with a homogeneous electric&#160;field to mitigate the side reactions and dendrite generation. The Al&#8208;containing cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably alleviates the irreversible dissolution of the VOx cathode and the accumulation of byproducts. Consequently, the Zn || Zn cell with KASO exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle of 6000 h at 2 mA cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the VOx cathodes (VO2, V2O5 and NH4V4O10) in the ZS&#8211;KASO electrolyte showed excellent cycling stability, even at a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2.83 and high mass loading (~16 mg cm&#8208;2). This study offers a practical reference for concurrently addressing challenges at the anode and cathode of AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Supramolecular Polymorphism in Cyanine H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed a new cyanine dye 1, with two pedant rod&#8208;like groups, capable of forming two distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane; an H&#8208;type aggregate (Agg&#8208;H2) and a J&#8208;type aggregate (Agg&#8208;J). Importantly, these two polymorphs were not accessed through polymerization events, and instead through the thermal transformation of a third particle&#8208;like polymorph (Agg&#8208;H1) formed by the anti&#8208;cooperative assembly of 1. While Agg&#8208;H2 is generated upon cooling the solution of Agg&#8208;H1 by a thermoreversible polymorph transition, the Agg&#8208;J was obtained through a hidden pathway by combining sonication and cooling to the Agg&#8208;H1 solution. This is the first report on the obtention of H&#8208; and J&#8208;type cyanine polymorphs that in turn could be isolated in solid&#8208;state to render two new 2D photoactive materials. This paper unveils new strategies for designing 2D supramolecular polymers using calamitic residues, but also undercovers relevant aspects of pathway complexity and polymorph transitions that might be crucial for developing novel photonic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Specifically Editing Cancer Sialoglycans for Enhanced Immunotherapy In Vivo through Aptamer&#8208;Enzyme Chimeras</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoints blockade (ICB) therapies have demonstrated remarkable clinical success in treating cancer. However, its objective response rate remains suboptimal because current therapies rely on limited immune checkpoints that failed to cover the multiple immune evasion pathways of cancer. To explore potential ICB strategies, herein, we propose a glycoimmune checkpoint elimination (glycoICE) therapy depending on targeted edition of sialoglycans on tumor cell surface using aptamer&#8208;enzyme chimera (ApEC). The ApEC is readily generated via a one&#8208;step bioorthogonal procedure, allowing for large&#8208;scale and uniform production. The ApEC is able to target and desialylate cancer cells, leading to the elimination of sialoglycan&#8208;Siglec axis, which in turn activates immune cells and enhances immunotherapy efficiency. In addition to its remarkable therapeutic efficiency, the ApEC exhibits high tumor selectivity, which helps to avoid side effects caused by indiscriminate desialylation of normal tissues. Furthermore, the ApEC has the potential to be a versatile platform for specifical editing of sialoglycans in different tumor models by adjusting the aptamer sequences targeting associated with specific protein markers. This research not only introduces a novel molecular tool for the effective editing of sialoglycans in complex environments, but also provides valuable insights for advancing DNA&#8208;based drugs towards in vivo and clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Restricting Linker Rotation in Nanocages of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes using Crown Ether "Molecular Locks" for Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have long been prized for their exceptional C3H6/C3H8 separation performance. On the other hand, ZIF&#8208;8 has structural flexibility, where the external pressure triggers channel expansion, potentially deteriorating the molecular sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a reliable strategy to fine&#8208;tune the flexible pore structure of ZIF&#8208;8 by embedding crown ether within a ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) was selected as the cavity occupant and perfectly confined in the sodalite (SOD) cage of ZIF&#8208;8. The 15C5 molecules, which have a size comparable to the nanocage, impose a spatial constraint on linker rotation, enabling the phase transition to a rigid structure in the flexible ZIF&#8208;8. The corresponding 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7 bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug efflux &#8212; a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) &#8212; plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapy resistance. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps.&#160; Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine 123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalates&#8208;Mediated Selectivity in Pt Single&#8208;Atoms on Ceria for Environmental Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the reactivity and selectivity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a crucial yet challenging issue in heterogeneous catalysis. This study demonstrates selective catalysis facilitated by a polyoxometalates&#8208;mediated electronic interaction (PMEI) in a Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on CeO2 modified with Keggin&#8208;type phosphotungstate acid (HPW), labeled as Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW. The PMEI effect originates from the unique arrangement of isolated Pt atoms and HPW clusters on CeO2 surface. Electrons are transferred from ceria support to the electrophilic tungsten in HPW clusters, and subsequently, Pt atoms donate electrons to the now electron&#8208;deficient ceria. This phenomenon enhances the positive charge of Pt atoms, moderating O2 activation and limiting lattice oxygen mobility compared to the conventional Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The resulting electronic structure of Pt combined with the strong and local acidic environment of HPW on Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW leads to improved degradation of NH3, N2 selectivity in the NO conversion, and CO2 yield when inputting volatile organic compounds. This study sheds the light on the design of SACs with balanced reactivity and selectivity for environmental catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The P(III)&#8208;amidite based synthesis of stable isotope labeled mRNA&#8208;cap&#8208;structures enables their sensitive quantitation from brain tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 5&#8217; cap structure is crucial to mRNA function, with its diverse methylation patterns depending on the cellular state. Sensitive analytical methods are sought after to quantify this cap variety also referred to as cap epitranscriptome. To address a bottleneck for accurate and precise quantitation, we report a facile and fast access to high&#8208;quality synthetic standards via a new route, involving P(III)&#8208;amidite chemistry. A range of cap nucleotides and their stable heavy isotopic labeled analogues were derived from nucleoside diphosphates, which themselves were directly prepared in a one&#8208;step reaction sequence starting from unprotected nucleosides using a triphosphorylating reagent in combination with ethylenediamine. Considering a wider scope, the route also enables direct access to magic spot nucleotides and diphosphates of isoprenyl&#8208;alcohols. Stable&#8208;isotope labeled cap nucleotides derived from this route paved the way for the development of a highly sensitive LC&#8208;MS/MS method, applied to the characterization of mouse brain cap epitranscriptomes, which turned out to be very different from those of cultured cell lines of widespread use in the life sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Tandem Acyl Carrier Proteins Necessitate In&#8208;Series Polyketide Processing in the Leinamycin Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The leinamycin family of polyketides are promising antitumour antibiotics, yet several aspects of their biosynthesis remain elusive. All leinamycin family members bear a sulfur&#8208;containing moiety which is essential for the anticancer activity exhibited by leinamycin. The key building blocks required for the incorporation of these functionalities are introduced in the final module of the polyketide synthase (PKS), which elegantly combines &#946;&#8208;branching and thiocysteine incorporation to generate a diverse library of sulfur&#8208;based molecular scaffolds. Two acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) form a key didomain component of this module, but their amino acid sequence divergence has brought into question the common notion of functional equivalence. Here, we provide unprecedented functional evidence that these tandem ACPs play distinct roles in the final module of polyketide assembly. Using the weishanmycin biosynthetic pathway as a template, the in vitro reconstitution of key polyketide chain extension and &#946;&#8208;branching steps in this module has revealed strict functional selectivity for a single ACP. Furthermore, we propose a cryptic transacylation step must occur prior to polyketide off&#8208;loading and cyclization. Altogether, these mechanistic investigations suggest that an atypical in&#8208;series mechanism underpins sulfur incorporation in the leinamycin family, and provides significant progress towards delineating their late&#8208;stage assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Mechanoresistivity by Intermetallic Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;electrode interface is key to unlocking emergent behaviour in all organic electrified systems, from battery technology to molecular electronics. In the latter, interfacial engineering has enabled efficient transport, higher device stability, and novel functionality. Mechanoresistivity &#8211; the change in electrical behaviour in response to a mechanical stimulus and a pathway to extremely sensitive force sensors &#8211; is amongst the most studied phenomena in molecular electronics, and the molecule&#8208;electrode interface plays a pivotal role in its emergence, reproducibility, and magnitude. In this contribution, we show that organometallic molecular wires incorporating a Pt(II) cation show mechanoresistive behaviour of exceptional magnitude, with conductance modulations of more than three orders of magnitude upon compression by as little as 1 nm. We synthesised series of cyclometalated Pt(II) molecular wires, and used scanning tunnelling microscopy &#8211; break junction techniques to characterise their electromechanical behaviour. Mechanoresistivity arises from an interaction between the Pt(II) cation and the Au electrode triggered by mechanical compression of the single&#8208;molecule device, and theoretical modelling confirms this hypothesis. Our study provides a new tool for the design of functional molecular wires by exploiting previously unreported ion&#8208;metal interactions in single&#8208;molecule devices, and develops a new framework for the development of mechanoresistive molecular junctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stage Reduction Strategy of Tin Perovskite Enables High Performance Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid oxidation of Sn2+ in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) restricts their efficiency and stability have been main bottleneck towards further development. This study developed a novel strategy which utilizes thiosulfate ions (S2O32&#8208;) in the precursor solution to enable a dual&#8208;stage reduction process. In the solution stage, thiosulfate acted as an efficacious reducing agent to reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+, meanwhile, its oxidation products were able to reduce I2 to I&#8208; during the film stage. This dual reduction ability effectively inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ and passivated defects, further promising an excellent stability of the perovskite devices. As a result, thiosulfate&#8208;incorporated devices achieved a high efficiency of 14.78% with open&#8208;circuit voltage reaching 0.96 V. The stability of the optimized devices achieved a remarkable improvement, maintaining 90% of their initial efficiencies after 628 hours at maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP). The findings provid research insights and experimental data support for the sustained dynamic reduction in TPSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Exposed Ru Clusters for the Efficient Multi&#8208;step Toluene Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are attractive platform molecules that play an important role in hydrogen energy storage and utilization. The multi&#8208;step hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) to methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been widely studied in the LOCHs systems, &#160;noble metal catalysts such as Ru has exhibited good performance in multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reactions, while the application is still hindered by their high cost and low specific activity.&#160;In this study, a series of Ru species were fabricated to investigate their structural evolution in the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction. The fully exposed and atomically dispersed Ru clusters, composed of an average of 3 Ru atoms, exhibit superior catalytic performance&#160;in TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation. Moreover, it delivers a high turnover frequency of 9850.3 h&#8208;1 under the relatively mild reaction, compared with those of single atoms and nanoparticles, and shows a notable advantage over catalysts reported in previous studies. From density functional theory calculations, the overall barrier of the TOL multi&#8208;step hydrogenation reaction over the fully exposed Ru clusters is lower than that of single atoms and nanoparticles, resulting in higher activity. This work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the reaction pathway of multi&#8208;step complicated catalytic reactions by designing fully exposed metal cluster catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2) is a clean and environmentally friendly energy carrier. The depletion of fossil fuels makes renewable H2 production highly desirable. Water reforming of renewable biomass to hydrogen, with a relay of natural photosynthesis to biomass, would be an indirect pathway to realize the ideal but extremely challenging photocatalytic overall water splitting to hydrogen, with favorable thermodynamics. Since the seminal work of water reforming of biomass in 1980, great endeavors have been made. Nevertheless, hitherto, the entire kinetic pathway has been elusive, which seriously limits the reforming processes. Using a designed well&#8208;organized redox&#8208;neutral cleavage of C&#8208;C, O&#8208;H and C&#8208;H bonds enabled by photoelectrocatalysis, here, we show the efficient water reforming of biomass to hydrogen at room temperature, with a yield up to 93%. The clear insights into the kinetic pathway with oxidation of carbon radicals to carbon cations as the indicated rate&#8208;determining step, would cast brightness for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production to accelerate the hydrogen economy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Well&#8208;Coupled Supramolecular System Accelerates Photophosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assembly allows multiple chemical/bio&#8208;components integrated as one system for cascade biochemical reactions. Herein the graphitic carbon nitrides (g&#8208;C3N4) as photocatalyst trapped in a dipeptide hydrogel covering adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase accelerates the photophosphorylation through ATP synthesis. Self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) as nanofibrils to allow g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets are embedded as a complex Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4 hydrogel. Fmoc&#8208;FF gel exhibits good electronic coupling with g&#8208;C3N4, which enables a photo&#8208;induced proton generation. The transmembrane proton gradient can be established by ATP synthase&#8208;lipid reconstituted on the surface of the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4 hydrogel to enhance the ATP synthesis. It indicates that the Fmoc&#8208;FF/g&#8208;C3N4/ATP synthase&#8208;lipid film can possess a longer&#8208;term ATP production capability and allow repeated immersion for sustained ATP production. Such a hydrogel&#8208;supported ATP synthesis platform is achieved by a procedure at a larger scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering &#960;&#8208;Electron Bridge Enables Low&#8208;Potential 2D Redox Polymer Anodes for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous All&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we propose a novel &#960;&#8208;electron bridge engineering strategy to explore a class of dioxin&#8208;bridged 2D redox covalent organic polymer (RCOP) as trade&#8208;off&#8208;breaking anodes for high&#8208;voltage aqueous all&#8208;organic batteries (AAOBs). By establishing a tunable RCOP platform, we perform theoretical study to scrutinize how bridge units between active sites affect the electrode potential and redox activity for the first time. We discover that compared to common pyrazine bridge, the weakened conjugation and strong electron donor character of the proposed dioxin bridge can induce elevated LUMO level and enriched &#960;&#8208;electron populations in active sites, heralding a low electrode potential and enhanced redox activity. Besides, nonaromaticity induced molecular flexibility of dioxin bridge mitigates intermolecular stacking for sufficient active site exposure and charge carrier uptake. To experimentally corroborate this, a new dioxin&#8208;bridged RCOP (D&#8208;HATN) and its pyrazine&#8208;bridged analogue (P&#8208;HATN) are synthesized for proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration. Hence, D&#8208;HATN displays excellent compatibility with Na+/Zn2+/NH4+/H3O+ and obviously lower redox potentials in various electrolytes compared to P&#8208;HATN, while affording rapid Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction and unprecedented durability in acid. Thus, &#160;the D&#8208;HATN&#8208;involved all&#8208;organic proton battery delivers an average output voltage of 0.75 V, which can be further elevated to 1.63 V with alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid electrolyte design, affording markedly&#8208;increased specific energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Pressure&#8208;Induced Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission of Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Clusters: The Competitive Effect between Coprophilic Interactions and Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with multiple emitting is crucial for enriching lighting and display materials with various colors. However, the luminescent properties of traditional ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters are often closely associated with low&#8208;energy cluster&#8208;centered triplet emission, which will redshift further as the Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu bond length decreases. This article utilizes a pressure&#8208;treated strategy to achieve an anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence phenomenon in ionic Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 crystals for the first time, which is based on dominant through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT). Herein, we reveal that the more advantageous through&#8208;space interactions in the competition between coprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions can lead to a blue&#8208;shifted luminescence. High&#8208;pressure angle&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;pressure infrared experiments show that the enhanced through&#8208;space interactions mainly originate from forming new intermolecular C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and the enhancement of van der Waals interactions&#160;between organic cations and anionic clusters. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies of excited&#8208;state dynamics confirm that the blue&#8208;shifted emission is due to the increased energy gap between the excited triplet and ground states caused by the electron delocalization under stronger through&#8208;space interactions. This work deepens previous understanding and provides a new avenue to design and synthetic ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with high&#8208;energy TSCT emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Efficient White&#8208;light Emission in Sulfur Dots through Surface Charge Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur dots (SDs) have emerged as promising photoluminescence (PL) materials owing to their intrinsic merits such as abundant electronic effects, outstanding biocompatibility and available photocatalytic activity. Typically based on quantum confinement effects, SDs are reported usually confined emission in blue&#8208;to&#8208;green region. However, it is challenging to achieve their broad emission tunability in the visible region, restricted by inherent band gap of bulk sulfur (ca. 2.79 eV). Herein, we present white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting SDs achieved by surface charge engineering that hybridizes the surface of SDs with oleylamine. The resulting SDs exhibit broadband emissions (full width at half maximum of 187 nm) with PL quantum yields of up to 12.1% and Commission International de I&#8217;Eclairage color coordinates of (0.27, 0.32). Detailed experimental and calculation results reveal that the strong orbital coupling between oleylamine and sulfur on the hybrid surfaces of the SDs causes electron delocalization, leading to the generation of low&#8208;energy charge transfer (CT) states. These CT states are highly sensitive to sulfur&#8208;oleylamine hybrid structures, which complicate the transition dynamics and promote multi&#8208;energy emission, accounting for efficient white&#8208;light emission. The demonstration of white&#8208;light SDs based on surface charge engineering is an important step towards the development of sulfur&#8208;based PL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Vinylic C&#8211;H Addition via Metallaphotoredox Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geometrically defined allylic alcohols with SE, SZ, RE and RZ stereoisomers serve as valuable intermediates in synthetic chemistry, attributed to the stereoselective transformations enabled by the alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. When an ideal scenario presents itself with four distinct stereoisomers as potential products, the simultaneous control vicinal stereochemistry in a single step would offer a direct pathway to any desired stereoisomer. Here, we unveil a metallaphotoredox migration strategy to access stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8211;H activation with aldehydes. This method harnesses a chiral nickel catalyst in concert with a photocatalyst to enable a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration by using readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials. The efficacy of this methodology is highlighted by the precise construction of all stereoisomers of allylic alcohols bearing analogous substituents and the efficient synthesis of key intermediates en route to Myristinin family. Experimental and computational studies have shed light on pivotal aspects including the synergy of metal catalysis and photocatalysis, the driving forces behind the migration, and the determination of absolute configuration in the C&#8211;H addition process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission has shown potential for boosting the power conversion efficiency of solar cells, but the scarcity of suitable molecular materials hinders its implementation. We introduce an uncertainty&#8208;controlled genetic algorithm (ucGA) based on ensemble machine learning predictions from different molecular representations that concurrently optimizes excited state energies, synthesizability, and singlet exciton size for the discovery of singlet fission materials. The ucGA allows us to efficiently explore the chemical space spanned by the reFORMED fragment database, which consists of 45,000 cores and 5,000 substituents derived from crystallographic structures assembled in the FORMED repository.&#160;
Running the ucGA in an exploitative setup performs local optimization on variations of known singlet fission scaffolds, such as acenes. In an explorative mode, hitherto unknown candidates displaying excellent excited state properties for singlet fission are generated. We suggest a class of heteroatom&#8208;rich mesoionic compounds as acceptors for charge&#8208;transfer mediated singlet fission. When included in larger conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor systems, these units exhibit strong localization of the triplet state, favorable diradicaloid character and suitable triplet energies for exciton injection into semiconductor solar cells. As the proposed candidates are composed of fragments from synthesized molecules, they are likely synthetically accessible.</dc:description>

         <title>Allylic Epoxides Increase the Strain Energy of Cyclic Olefin Monomers for Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is an effective method for synthesizing functional polymers, but since the technique typically relies on high ring strain cyclic olefins, the most common monomers are norbornene derivatives. The reliance on one class of monomer limits the obtainable properties of ROMP polymers. In this work, we investigate new bicyclic monomers synthesized via epoxidation of commercial dienes. DFT estimates of these monomers&#8217; ring strains suggests a significant increase in strain for cyclic olefins containing allylic epoxides. We found that the eight&#8208;membered (3,4&#8208;COO) and five&#8208;membered (CPO) cyclic olefins were particularly effective for ROMP. CPO was of especially intriguing due to its excellent polymerizability when compared to the limited reactivity of other five&#8208;membered rings. Unlike polynorbornenes, the resulting polymers of both monomers displayed glass transition temperatures well below room temperature. Interestingly, poly(3,4&#8208;COO) showed both high stereo&#8208; and regioregularity while poly(CPO) showed little regularity. Both polymers could be readily modified via post&#8208;polymerization ring&#8208;opening of the reactive allylic epoxides. With a high epoxide density in poly(CPO), CPO is an exciting new ROMP monomer that is easily synthesized, can be polymerized to high conversion at room temperature, and may be facilely modified to yield a wide range of functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereocontrolled Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enones to Alcohols via Dual Iridium&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of dual catalysis is an emerging area holding high potential in terms of preparative efficiency, yet faces severe challenges in compatibility of reaction conditions and interference of catalysts. The transition&#8208;metal catalyzed stereoselective hydrogenation of olefins and ketones typically proceeds under different reaction conditions and/or uses a different reductant. As a result, these two types of hydrogenations can normally not be performed in the same pot. Herein, the stereocontrolled hydrogenation of enones to saturated alcohols is described, enabled by orthogonal dual iridium catalysis, using molecular hydrogen for both reductions. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, N,P&#8208;iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards olefins) and NHC,P&#8208;iridium catalysts (hydrogenation active towards ketones) operated independently of one another allowing the construction of two contiguous stereogenic centers up to 99% ee, 99/1 d.r. Ultimately, by simple selection of the chirality of either ligands, the enone could be efficiently reduced&#160;to all&#160;four stereoisomers of the saturated alcohol in equally high stereopurity. This degree of stereocontrol for the synthesis of different stereoisomers by dual transition&#8208;metal catalyzed hydrogenation was previously not attained. The generality in substituted enones (alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl) demonstrate the wide applicability of this concept.</dc:description>

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Driven Aqueous&#8208;Phase Methane Conversions into Complex Molecules up to Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental understanding of initial evolutions of molecules in the universe is of great interest and importance. CH4 is one of the abundant simple molecules in the universe. Herein we report &#947;&#8208;ray, high&#8208;energy photons commonly existing in cosmic rays and unstable isotope decay, as an external energy to efficiently drives aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions to various products with the presence of oxygen at room temperature. Glycine also forms with an additional introduction of ammonia. Both CH4 conversions and product distributions are modified by solid granules, and a CH3COOH selectivity as high as 82% is obtained when SiO2 is added. Our results point to &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions as a likely formation network of initial complex organic compounds in the universe and offer an alternative strategy for efficiently utilizing CH4 as the carbon source to produce value&#8208;added products at mild conditions, a long&#8208;standing challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Inner Side Chain Modification of Small Molecule Acceptors Enables Lower Energy Loss and High Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Processed with Non&#8208;halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents usually suffer from excessive self&#8208;aggregation of small molecule acceptors (SMAs), severe phase separation and higher energy loss (Eloss), leading to reduced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE).   Here, we designed and synthesized two SMAs L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;PhMe by introducing different substituents (fluorine for L8&#8208;PhF and methyl for L8&#8208;PhMe) on the phenyl end group of inner side chains of L8&#8208;Ph, and investigated the effect of the substituents on the intermolecular interaction of SMAs, Eloss and performance of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents. It is found that compared with L8&#8208;PhF, which possesses strong intermolecular interactions but downgraded molecular packing order, L8&#8208;PhMe exhibits more effective non&#8208;covalent interactions, which improves the tightness and order of molecular packing. When blending the SMAs with PM6, the OSCs based on L8&#8208;PhMe shows reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss, and enhanced Voc than the devices based on the other two SMAs. Consequently, the L8&#8208;PhMe based device processed with o&#8208;xylene and using 2PACz as the hole transport layer shows an outstanding PCE of 19.27%. This study highlights that the Eloss of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents could be decreased through regulating the intermolecular interactions of SMAs by inner side chain modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipole Moment Dictates the Preferential Immobilization in Gel Electrolytes for Ah&#8208;level Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries are of great interest due to their high material abundance, low production cost, and excellent safety. However, they suffer from severe side reactions and notorious dendrite growth closely related to electrolytes. Here, in&#8208;situ generated zwitterionic polymers are used as gel electrolytes to overcome these problems. It is shown that anions and H2O, but not anions and cations, are preferentially immobilized at different sites of zwitterionic polymers, facilitating the free migration of Zn2+ and reducing the side reactions. This immobilization can be associated with the dipole moment of zwitterionic polymers. As a result, poly[3&#8208;dimethyl(methacryloyl oxyethyl) ammonium propane sulfonate] (PDMAPS) stands out from a series of zwitterionic polymers and outperforms the other candidates in electrochemical performance. The symmetric cells using PDMAPS smoothly operate ~9000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2 for 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2, much better than the controls. Moreover, PDMAPS enables an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell for continuous cycling. These results not only benefit the rational molecular design of advanced electrolytes, but also demonstrate the promising potential of zwitterionic polymers in aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Au@CeO2 Helical Nanorods with Spatially Separated Structures for Polarization&#8208;dependent N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral photocatalytic nanomaterials possess numerous unique properties and hold promise for various applications in chemical synthesis, environmental protection, energy conversion, and photoelectric devices. Nevertheless, it is uncommon to develop effective means to enhance the asymmetric catalytic performances of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials. In this study, a type of L/D&#8208;Au@CeO2 helical nanorods (HNRs) was fabricated by selectively growing CeO2 on the surface of Au HNRs via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry construction method. Chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs, featuring Au and CeO2 with spatially separate structures, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance for N2 fixation, being 50.80 &#177; 2.64 times greater than Au HNRs. Furthermore, when L&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs corresponded left circularly polarized light (CPL) and D&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs corresponded right CPL, their photocatalytic efficiency was enhanced by 3.06 &#177; 0.06 times in contrast with the samples illuminated with the opposite CPL, which can be attributed to the asymmetrical generation of hot carriers upon CPL excitation. This study not only offered a simple approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials but also demonstrated the potential of chiral plasmonic materials for application in specific photocatalytic reactions, such as N2 fixation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral photocatalytic nanomaterials possess numerous unique properties and hold promise for various applications in chemical synthesis, environmental protection, energy conversion, and photoelectric devices. Nevertheless, it is uncommon to develop effective means to enhance the asymmetric catalytic performances of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials.

         <dc:description>Facile non&#8208;radiative decay of low&#8208;lying metal&#8208;centered (MC) d&#8208;d excited states has been well documented to pose a significant obstacle to the development of phosphorescent NiII complexes due to substantial structural distortions between the d&#8208;d excited state and the ground state. Herein, we prepared a series of dinuclear Ni2II,II complexes by using strong &#963;&#8208;donors, carbene&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbene (CNHC^Cphenyl^CNHC) pincer ligands, and prepared their dinuclear Pt2II,II and Pd2II,II analogues. Dinuclear Ni2II,II complexes bridged by formamidinate/&#945;&#8208;carbolinato ligand exhibit short Ni&#8208;Ni distances of 2.947&#8208;3.054 &#197; and singlet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MMLCT) transitions at 500&#8208;550 nm. Their 1MMLCT absorption energies are red&#8208;shifted relative to the Pt2II,II and Pd2II,II analogues at ~450 nm and &#8804;420 nm respectively. One&#8208;electron oxidation of these Ni2II,II complexes produces valence&#8208;trapped dinuclear Ni2II,III species, which are characterized by EPR spectroscopy. Upon photoexcitation, these Ni2II,II complexes display phosphorescence (&#964;=2.6&#8208;8.6 &#956;s) in the NIR (800&#8208;1400nm)&#160;spectral region in 2&#8208;MeTHF and in solid state at 77 K, which is insensitive to &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the coordinated [CNHC^Cphenyl^CNHC] ligand. Combined with DFT calculations, the NIR emission is assigned to originate from the 3dd excited state. Studies have found that the dinuclear Ni2II,II complex can sensitize the formation of singlet oxygen and catalyze the oxidation of cyclo&#8208;dienes under light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

         <title>Multivalent Weak Protections Ultimately Enable Customizable DNA Grafting on Pristine Ag Colloids for Nanoplasmonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have superior plasmonic properties surpassing other metals. However, a long&#8208;standing difficulty in valence/density&#8208;tunable DNA grafting of AgNPs disfavors their use in DNA&#8208;directed nanoplasmonics. Herein a close&#8208;to&#8208;ideal surface protection of pristine AgNPs against various notorious stability issues of Ag is achieved based on multidentate weak nucleobase bindings of non&#8208;programming FSDNA (fish sperm DNA). This further allows grafting of thiolated DNA with tunable valence/density on AgNPs. The end&#8208;on format of the thiolated DNA grafts and the very thin FSDNA layer benefit DNA hybridization and plasmon coupling, respectively. Significantly promoted optical coupling and Raman enhancing are achieved. The compatibility of FSDNA&#8208;capped AgNPs with Au enables DNA&#8208;bonded symmetry&#8208;broken Au&#8208;Ag heterodimers with strong near&#8208;field coupling and an easily seen Fano&#8208;induced feature. Our work provides a treasured freedom of using AgNPs in DNA&#8208;programmed, better&#8208;behaving plasmonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activable Charge Transfer Agents for Synergistic Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become an attractive tumor treatment modality, yet the facile design of photoimmunotheranostic agents with efficient near infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbing and immune&#8208; activating capabilities remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we developed a NIR&#8208;activable organic charge transfer complex (CTC), with perylene (PER) as the electron donor and 4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrabromoisochromeno [6,5,4&#8208;def]isochromene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraone (Br4NDI) as the electron acceptor. Through further supramolecular assembly, the PER&#8208;Br4NDI nanoparticle (PBND NP) for spatiotemporally controlled photoimmunotherapy was constructed. The PBND NP exhibits superb NIR absorption, robust intermolecular charge transfer, and enhanced intersystem crossing. Upon NIR photoirradiation, the PBND NP effectively exerts photothermal and photodynamic effects with a remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 63.5% and a high reactive oxygen species generation capability, which not only directly ablates primary tumors, but also dramatically suppresses distant tumor growth via promoted immunogenic cell death. Moreover, programmed cell death protein 1 antibody acts synergistically to block immune evasion and ultimately enhances cancer treatment efficacy. This work therefore sheds light on the design of organic CTCs for synergistic photoimmunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Hydrogen Radicals in Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt&#8208;Copper Mesoporous Nanoplates for Complete Nitrate Reduction Electrocatalysis to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ambient electrochemical reduction of waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) represents an alternative green route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) electrosynthesis in water. Despites some encouraged achievements, sluggish eight electron and nine proton reduction routes that involve multi&#8208;step hydrogenation pathways have severely hindered their NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FENH3) and yield rate. Herein, we develop a robust two&#8208;dimensional mesoporous cobalt&#8208;copper (meso&#8208;CoCu) nanoplate electrocatalyst that delivers excellent performance of complete NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR), including superior FENH3 of 98.8%, high NH3 yield rate of 3.39 mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and energy efficiency of 49.8%, and good cycling stability. Mechanism investigations unveil that active hydrogen (*H) radicals produced from water splitting on Co sites spillover to adjacent Cu sites and further stabilize within confined mesopores, which kinetically promote its coupling hydrogenation reactions of nitrogen intermediates and thus facilitate complete NO3RR for favorable NH3 electrosynthesis. Moreover, meso&#8208;CoCu nanoplates perform well as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system that concurrently synthesizes NH3 from NO3&#8722; at cathode and 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural at anode. This work in stabilizing *H radicals in mesoporous microenvironment provides some insights applied to various hydrogenation reactions for selective electrosynthesis of highly value&#8208;added chemicals in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Emulating &#8220;Curvature&#8208;Enhanced Adsorbate Coverage&#8221; for Superconformal and Orientated Zn Electrodeposition in Zinc&#8208;ion&#8208;Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uneven Zn deposition and unfavorable side reactions have prevented the reversibility of the Zn anode. Herein, we design a rearranged (002) textured Zn anode inspired by a traditional curvature&#8208;enhanced adsorbate coverage (CEAC) process to realize the highly reversible Zn anode. The rearranged (002) textured structure orientates the superconformal Zn deposition owing to the spatial deposition rate of the rearranged crystal planes, promoting bottom&#8208;up &#8220;superfilling&#8221; of the 3D Zn skeletons. Meanwhile, our designed anode also induces the epitaxial Zn deposition, alleviating the parasitic reactions owing to the lowest surface energy of the (002) plane. Attributed to these superiorities, uniform and oriented Zn deposition can be obtained, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 479 hrs at an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) of 82.12%. The Zn|Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O battery delivers an improved cycling performance, even at a high area capacity of 5.15 mAh/cm2 with a low negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratio of 1.63. The superconformal deposition approach for Zn anodes paves the way for the practical application of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>The Azide&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of heteroatoms into conjugated organic molecules is an important strategy to tune their reactivity and physical properties. In this realm triazabutadienes (TBDs) of the general from R2C=N&#8722;N=NR&#8217; are an interesting class of compounds, however, general synthetic protocols for their generation are limited. Based on the serendipitous finding that the sterically encumbered azide Mes*N3 (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2) reacted with PMe3 in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde to form a TBD, we now report on the &#8220;Azide&#8208;Wittig&#8221; reaction. This azide&#8208;Wittig reaction is shown to be a versatile tool for the synthesis of a variety of TBDs, tolerating a wide range of aldehydes and organic azides as coupling partners. The preference for azide&#8208;Wittig, rather than aza&#8208;Wittig reactivity was rationalized using computational methods. This study shows how kinetic control can significantly alter the reaction pathway, thereby switching from an aza&#8208;Wittig to an azide&#8208;Wittig regime.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane towards Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free&#160;lithium (Li) metal batteries (AFLBs) featured high energy density are viewed as the viable future energy storage technology. However, the irregular Li deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode current collectors reduce their cycling performance. Here, we propose a concept of anion&#8208;recognition electrodes enabled by anion&#8208;&#960; interactions to regulate the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and electrolyte solvation chemistry for high&#8208;performance AFLBs. By engineering the electrodes with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic&#8208;&#960; systems that possess high permanent quadrupole moment (Qzz&#160;),&#160;the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions can be generated to concentrate the anions on the electrode surface and tune the IHP structure to construct a stable anion&#8208;derived SEI layer, thus achieving highly reversible Li plating/stripping process. Through designing various current collectors with different Qzz values, the intimate correlations among the surface charge of the electrode, competitive adsorption of the IHP, and SEI structures are demonstrated. Particularly, the modified carbon cloth current collector with a high Qzz value (+35.1) delivers a high average Li stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency of 99.1% over 230 cycles in the carbonated electrolyte, enabling a long lifespan and high capacity retention of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based AFLBs with a commercial&#8208;level areal capacity (4.1 mA h cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Stapled Peptides as Inhibitors of mRNA Deadenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic intervention targeting mRNA typically aims at reducing the levels of disease&#8208;causing sequences. Achieving the opposite effect of blocking the destruction of beneficial mRNA remains underexplored. The degradation of mRNA starts with the removal of poly(A) tails reducing their stability and translational activity which is mainly regulated by the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex. The subunit NOT9 binds various RNA binding proteins which recruit mRNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner to the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex to promote their deadenylation. These RNA binding proteins interact with NOT9 through a helical NOT9 binding motif which we used as a starting point for development of the hydrocarbon stapled peptide NIP&#8208;2. The peptide (KD = 60.4 nM) was able to inhibit RNA&#8208;binding (IC50 = 333 nM) as well as the deadenylation activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex in vitro while being cell&#8208;permeable (EC50 = 2.44 &#956;M). A co&#8208;crystal structure of NIP&#8208;2 bound to NOT9 allowed further optimization of the peptide through point mutation leading to NIP&#8208;2&#8208;H27A&#8208;N3(KD = 122 nM) with high cell permeability (cell&#8208;permeability EC50 = 0.34 &#956;M). The optimized peptide was able to inhibit deadenylation of target mRNAs when used in HeLa cells at a concentration of 100 &#956;M demonstrating the feasibility of increasing mRNA stability.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling for urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8208;) offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional Bosch&#8208;Meiser method.

Herein, we developed a Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8208;Schottky catalyst with nanoscale rectifying heterointerfaces through precise controllable in&#8208;situ electroreduction of Cu2O nanowires, achieving notable FE (32.6&#8208;47.0%) and substantial yields (6.08&#8208;30.4 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials (0 to &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE). Operando synchrotron radiation&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR&#8208;FTIR) confirmed the formation of *CO intermediates and C&#8208;N bonds, subsequently density functional theory (DFT) calculations deciphered that the Cu/Cu2O rectifying heterointerface modulated *CO adsorption, significantly enhancing subsequent C&#8208;N coupling dynamics between *CO and *NOH intermediates.

         <title>The Key Descriptors for Predicting the Exciton Binding Energy of Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter to determine the mechanism and performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Small Eb benefits to reduce the interfacial energy offset and the energy loss of organic solar cells. However, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the Eb in solid state with considering electronic polarization effects are extremely time&#8208;consuming. Furthermore, current studies lack critical descriptors. Here, we use data&#8208;driven machine learning (ML) to accelerate the computation and identify the key descriptors most relevant to the solid&#8208;state Eb. The results verify two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation&#8208;state properties for efficient prediction of the solid&#8208;state Eb. Moreover, a very high accuracy is achieved by using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm, with the Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient of 0.92. Finally, we use this ML model to predict the Eb of thin films, which is difficult to achieve using the current quantum&#8208;chemical calculations due to the large structural disorder. Remarkably, the predicted thin&#8208;film Eb values are fully consistent with the results of temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. Therefore, our work provides an accurate and efficient approach to predict the solid&#8208;state Eb and would be helpful to accelerate the exploitation of novel promising organic photovoltaic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;organized Patterns in Non&#8208;reciprocal Active Droplet Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self&#8208;organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet mixtures with predator&#8208;prey interactions can result in a variety of self&#8208;organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self&#8208;organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Chiral Helicene&#8208;Indenido ansa&#8208; and Half&#8208;Sandwich Metal Complexes and Their Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent tremendous progress in the synthesis of nonplanar chiral aromatics, and helicenes in particular, their conversion to half&#8208;sandwich or sandwich transition metal complexes still lags behind, although they represent an attractive family of modular and underexplored chiral architectures with a potential catalytic use. In this work, starting from various chiral helicene&#8208;indene proligands, we prepared the enantio&#8208; and diastereopure oxa[6]&#8208; and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhI and RhIII complexes and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;bisindenido ansa&#8208;metallocene FeII complex. To document their use, oxahelicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhIII complexes were employed as chiral catalysts in enantioselective C&#8208;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to afford a series of axially chiral biaryls in mostly good to high yields and in up to 96 : 4 er. Thus, we developed stereocontrolled synthesis of chiral helicene&#8208;indenido ansa&#8208; and half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes, successfully demonstrated the first use of such helicene Cp&#8208;related metal complexes in enantioselective catalysis, and described an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Titanium&#8208;MOF Membrane for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise hydrogen sorting from purge gas (H2/N2) and coke gas (H2/CH4), commonly carried out by cryogenic distillation, still suffers from low separation efficiency, high energy consumption, and considerable capital cost. Though still in its infancy, membrane technology offers a potential to achieve more efficient hydrogen purification. In this study, an optimum separation of hydrogen towards both methane and nitrogen via a kinetically&#8208;driven mechanism is realized through preferred orientation control of a MOF membrane. Relying on the 0.3 nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate, b&#8208;oriented Ti&#8208;MOF membrane exhibits ultra&#8208;high hydrogen selectivity, surpassing the upper bound limit of separating H2/N2 and H2/CH4 gas pairs attained so far by inorganic membranes. This spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability owing to the synergistic effect of the 1 nm&#8208;sized MOF channel.</dc:description>

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Dendrite&#8208;Free Flexible Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. This work offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.







Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. Hydrogel electrolytes present a compelling alternative to liquid electrolytes due to their remarkable flexibility and clear advantages in mitigating parasitic side reactions. However, hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on heteroatom (B, Al, or Ga)&#8208;containing amorphous zeolite, achieves the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, demonstrating a recorded turnover frequency value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high styrene selectivity (95&#8201;%).







Abstract
As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on boron&#8208;containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Advanced characterizations and theoretical density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporated B atoms in the Pd/AZ&#8722;B can not only alter the geometric and electronic properties of Pd atoms by controlling the electron migration from Pd but also mitigate the interaction between alkene and the catalyst supports. This boosts the exceptional catalytic efficacy in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene under mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), achieving a recorded turnover frequency (TOF) value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and demonstrating 95&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at full conversion of phenylacetylene. By comparison, the heteroatom&#8208;free amorphous zeolite&#8208;anchored Pd nanoparticles and the commercial Lindlar catalyst have styrene selectivities of 73&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. This work establishes a solid foundation for developing highly active and selective hydrogenation catalysts by controllably optimizing their electronic and steric properties.

&lt;p&gt;As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over-hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single-atom Pd catalysts supported on boron-containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes.

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ampere&#8208;level propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) is achieved over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) in a membraneless reactor, in virtue of the synergetic combination of both the penetration effect and the spatial&#8208;coupling strategy, exhibiting specificity propylene oxide (PO) production of over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency (FEPO) and a maximum 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 PO partial current density (jPO), with significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.







Abstract
The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to ampere level (achieving over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging P and Fe from spent LiFePO4 cathodes, in situ generated PO43&#8722; and NiOOH/Fe3(PO4)2 heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&#8722; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8722; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8722; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two&#8208;step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.







Abstract
Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful polymerization of water, isocyanide, and chlorooxime was established toward polyamide with a novel modifiable architecture. Through hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction, emissive units were introduced to the polyamide, which emission colors could range from blue to red. The refractive index (n) of polyamides was also significantly improved and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53 900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.

Remarkably, the refractive index (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non-heavy atom-containing polymers after post-modification, and its micron-thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of the entire electrooxidation reaction pathway on the Pd single crystal surface can be outlined by obtaining the direct spectroscopic evidence of *OH and *OO intermediates via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that surface&#8208;adsorbed ClO4&#8722; ions can facilitate the deprotonation process of *OH and accelerate the electrooxidation process.







Abstract
The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8722; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8722; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Front Cover: Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/non&#8208;natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300 mm s&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300 mm s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <dc:description>
The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

         <title>Front Cover: Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Photoswitches for High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches in solid state remains an enormous challenge in smart materials. Such photoswitches are obtained from salicylaldimines through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and subsequent cis&#8208;trans isomerization strategies. By incorporating a bulky naphthalimide fluorophore into Schiff base, three photoswitches achieve dual&#8208;mode changes (both color and fluorescence) in the solid state. In particular, the optimal one generates triple fluorescence changing from green, to yellow and finally orange upon visible light irradiation. This switching process is fully reversible and can be repeated at least 10 times without obvious attenuation, suggesting its superior photo&#8208;fatigue resistance. Mechanism studies reveal that naphthalimide group not only enables the tuning of multicolor with an additional emission, but also induces a folded structure, reducing molecular stacking and facilitating ESIPT and cis&#8208;trans isomerization. As such, photopatterning, ternary encoding and transient information recording and erasing are successfully developed. The present study provides a reliable strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches, showing implications for advanced information encryption materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Front Cover: Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a &#8220;simple&#8221; yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Insertion Strategy for Constructing 2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Large Pore Size for Electrochemical Analytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have shown great promise in various electrochemical applications due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity. A large pore aperture is a favorable feature of this type of material because it facilitates the mass transport of chemical species and electrolytes. In this work, we propose a ligand insertion strategy in which a linear ligand is inserted into the linkage between multitopic ligands, extending the metal ion into a linear unit of &#8208;M&#8208;ligand&#8208;M&#8208;, for the construction of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with large pore apertures, utilizing only small ligands. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial of this strategy, a 2D c&#8208;MOF with mesopores of 3.2 nm was synthesized using commercially available ligands hexahydrotriphenylene and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone. The facilitation of the diffusion of redox species by the large pore size of this MOF was demonstrated through a series of probes. With this feature, it showed superior performance in the electrochemical analysis of a variety of biological species.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research on electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) catalysts using renewable energy is particularly crucial in energy conversion studies, especially for viable hydrocarbon production. This study employs density functional theory calculations to screen a series of non&#8208;radioactive lanthanide two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for product selectivity in ECR. Based on theoretical screening, our focus is on a lutetium (Lu)&#8208;based conducting MOF (Lu&#8208;HHTP), which exhibits a Faradaic&#160;efficiency of approximately 77% for methane (CH4) production and maintains a stable current density of &#8208;280 mA/cm2&#160;at &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE. In situ electrochemical experiments and material characterization demonstrate that the Lu sites possess high coordination stability and structural recoverability during catalytic CO2&#160;reduction, attributed to the overlap between Lu's f&#8208;orbitals&#160;and the &#960;*&#8208;orbitals of the ligand O, and the formation of back bonding orbitals between the f&#8208;orbitals of Lu and the &#960;* orbitals of CO contribute increasing CH&#8324;&#160;selectivity and lowering the potential. This study leverages rare&#8208;earth MOF&#8208;type materials, offering a novel approach to addressing low conductivity and stabilizing rare&#8208;earth materials, thereby establishing a theoretical framework for the conversion of linearly adsorbed *CO into hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Construction of Cyanide&#8208;Functionalized D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Covalent Organic Framework&#160;for Highly Efficient Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis from Air and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and air represents currently a promising route to reform the industrial anthraquinone production manner, but, still blocks by the requirement of pure O2 feedstock, due to the insufficient oxygen supply from water under air. Herein, we report a rational molecule design on COFs (covalent organic frameworks) equiped with cyanide&#8208;functionalized D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D system for highly efficient overall H2O2 production from air and water through photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR). Without using any sacrificial agent, the as&#8208;synthesized D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D COF is found to enable a H2O2 production rate as high as 4742 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 from water and air and an O2 utilization and conversion rate up to 88%, exceeding the other D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A COF by respectively 1.9&#8208; and 1.3&#8208;fold. Such high performance is attributed to the tuned electronic structure and prolonged charge lifetime facilitated by the unique D&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D structure and cyanide groups. This work highlights a fundamental molecule design on advanced photocatalytic COFs with complicated D&#8208;A system for low&#8208;cost and massive H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Depolymerization of Functionalized Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used plastic type in the world, contributing significantly to the plastic waste crisis. Microbial degradation of PE in natural environments is unlikely due to its inert saturated carbon&#8208;carbon backbones, which are difficult to break down by enzymes, challenging the development of a biocatalytic recycling method for PE waste. Here, we demonstrated the depolymerization of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) PE using an enzyme cascade that included a catalase&#8208;peroxidase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase, and a lipase after the polymer was chemically pretreated with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and ultrasonication. In a preparative experiment with gram&#8208;scale pretreated polymers, GC&#8208;MS and weight loss determinations confirmed ~27% polymer conversion including the formation of medium&#8208;size functionalized molecules such as &#969;&#8208;hydroxy acids and &#945;,&#969;&#8208;carboxylic acids. Additional polymer property analyses using AFM showed that enzymatic depolymerization reduced the particle sizes of this mCPBA&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;treated LMWPE. This multi&#8208;enzyme catalytic concept with distinct chemical steps represents a unique starting point for future development of bio&#8208;based recycling methods for polyolefin waste.</dc:description>

         <title>An Automated Electrochemical Flow Platform to Accelerate Library Synthesis and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Automated batch and flow reactors are well&#8208;established for high throughput experimentation in both thermal chemistry and photochemistry. However, the development of automated electrochemical platforms is hindered by cell miniaturization challenges in batch and difficulties in designing effective single&#8208;pass flow systems. In order to address these issues, we have designed and implemented a new, slug&#8208;based automated electrochemical flow platform. This platform was successfully demonstrated for electrochemical C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings of E3 ligase binders with diverse amines (44 examples), which were subsequently transferred to a continuous&#8208;flow mode for confirmation and isolation, showing its applicability for medicinal chemistry purposes. To further validate the versatility of the platform, Design of Experiments (DoE) optimization was performed for an unsuccessful library target. This optimization process, fully automated by the platform, resulted in a remarkable 6&#8208;fold increase in reaction yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling of Gaseous Alkanes with (Hetero)Aryl Bromides via Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gaseous alkanes represent the most abundant carbon&#8208;based chemical feedstocks in our planet. However, the intrinsic inertness of their C&#8208;H bonds has rendered the use of these alkanes very difficult for purposes beyond aerobic combustion and energy intensive processes. Thus, clean and energy&#8208;efficient transformations for their use in synthetic organic chemistry are still rare. Here we report a catalytic methodology for the direct cross&#8208;coupling of gaseous alkanes with (hetero)aryl bromides through the combination of metallaphotoredox&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis. This protocol provides an efficient platform for the addition of short alkyl groups into diverse (hetero) aromatic rings, providing a wide range of high&#8208;value alkyl(hetero)arenes, and bypassing the longstanding need of using preactivated alkylating agents in C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings. The method features high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and a remarkable functional group tolerance, operates under mild conditions, and exhibits operational simplicity</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Controllable Thermochromic Fluorescence via Synergistic Intramolecular Charge Transfer and Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) have attracted significant attention due to their unique fluorescent colorimetric response to temperature. However, existing TFMs still suffer from weak stimulus responsiveness, broad temperature response ranges, uncontrollable emission color changes, and low quantum yields. In this study, we address these issues by designing and synthesizing three diketone&#8208;boron complexes with distinct emission wavelengths (NWPU&#8208;(2&#8208;4)). Utilizing a molecular engineering strategy to manipulate intramolecular charge transfer transitions and molecular packing modes, our synthesized complexes exhibit efficient fluorescence emission in both solution and solid states. Moreover, their emission wavelengths are highly sensitive to environmental polarity. By incorporating these compounds into thermosensitive matrices of long&#8208;chain alkanes, we produced TFMs with varied fluorescence emission peak variation ranges. Notably, the TFM based on NWPU&#8208;4, owing to its strong charge transfer transitions and dense J&#8208;aggregate packing configuration, not only exhibits intense fluorescence emission spanning the deep red to near&#8208;infrared spectrum but also displays a remarkable 90 nm broad range of thermochromic properties. Ultimately, it was successfully applied to programmable, thermally controlled, multi&#8208;level information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Orderly Coating of Bilayer Polymer to Tailor Microenvironment for Efficient C&#8208;N Coupling Toward Highly Selective Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of urea from co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate is a promising alternative to the industrial process. However, the overwhelming existence of proton and nitrate as well as the insufficient supply of CO2 at the reaction interface usually result in complex product distributions from individual nitrate reduction or hydrogen evolution, instead of C&#8208;N coupling. In this work, we systematically optimize this microenvironment through orderly coating of bilayer polymer to specifically tackle the above challenges. Polymer of intrinsic microporosity is chosen as the upper polymer to achieve physical sieving, realizing low water diffusivity for suppressing hydrogen evolution and high gas permeability for smooth mass transfer of CO2 at the same time. Polyaniline with abundant basic amino groups is capable of triggering chemical interaction with acidic CO2 molecules, so that is used as the underlying polymer to serve as CO2 concentrator and facilitate the carbon source supply for C&#8208;N coupling. Within this tailored microenvironment, a maximum urea generation yield rate of 1671.6 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of 75.3% are delivered once coupled with efficient electrocatalyst with neighboring active sites, which is among the most efficient system of urea electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Enables Anions&#8208;Regulated Solvation Structure for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs) are attractive for stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high safety. However, their practical application is hindered by the excessive use of zinc anodes and poor high&#8208;temperature performance, caused by severe side reactions and dendritic growth issues. Here, an electrolyte design strategy is reported based on bidentate coordination of Zn2+ and solvent to tailor the solvation structure. The triethylene glycol (TEG) co&#8208;solvent with two&#8208;oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anions&#8208;involved solvation shell, greatly reducing the activity of coordinated H2O molecules. The sequential reduction of OTF&#8208; anions and TEG to form an organic&#8208;inorganic bilayer SEI (hydrophobic organic layer and high ion conductivity inorganic layer), protecting Zn anodes from side reaction and dendrite growth, thus ensuring an unprecedented Zn reversibility (99.95% over 5000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2). More importantly, the full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity (2552 mAh cm&#8208;2) under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio = 15 &#956;L mAh&#8208;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio = 1.9) and a high areal capacity (3.0 mAh cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

The sequential reduction of OTF- anions and TEG to form an organic-inorganic bilayer SEI (hydrophobic organic layer and high ion conductivity inorganic layer), protecting Zn anodes from side reaction and dendrite growth, thus ensuring an unprecedented Zn reversibility (99.95% over 5000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm-2). More importantly, the full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record-high cumulative capacity (2552 mAh cm-2) under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio = 15 &#956;L mAh-1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio = 1.9) and a high areal capacity (3.0 mAh cm-2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Effect of Fullerene Guest and Counterion on the Structural Stability and Electrical Conductivity of Octahedral Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of octahedral metallo&#8208;cages and cage&#8208;fullerene (C60 and C70) complexes have been constructed to explore electrical conductivity at both the single&#8208;molecule level and aggregated bulk state. Both the counterions and fullerenes effectively tune the electronic structures and packing density of the metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, and facilitate efficient charge transfer between the cage hosts and fullerenes, resulting in a notable one order of magnitude increase in the electrical conductivity of the aggregated state.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages have garnered tremendous attention for their diverse yet molecular&#8208;level precision structures. However, the physical properties of these supramolecular ensembles, which are of potential significance in molecular electronics, remain largely unexplored. We herein constructed a series of octahedral metallo&#8208;cages and cage&#8208;fullerene complexes with notably enhanced structural stability. As such, we could systematically evaluate the electrical conductivity of these ensembles at both the single&#8208;molecule level and aggregated bulk state (as well&#8208;defined films). Our findings reveal that counteranions and fullerene guests play a pivotal role in determining the electrical conductivity of the aggregated state, while such effects are less significant for single&#8208;molecule conductance. Both the counteranions and fullerenes effectively tune the electronic structures and packing density of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, and facilitate efficient charge transfer between the cage hosts and fullerenes, resulting in a notable one order of magnitude increase in the electrical conductivity of the aggregated state.

         <title>A Simple and Sequential Strategy for the Introduction of Complexity and Hierarchy in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) Crystals for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>

A simple strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures is proposed here. As proof of concept, we have obtained examples of HOF crystals with hierarchical superstructures and the first reported HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF crystals.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a new class of crystalline porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) with great potential for a diverse range of applications. HOFs face common challenges to POMMs, and in general to purely organic crystals, that is, the difficulty of integrating complexity in crystals. Herein, we propose a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8211;shell (HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricate multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOF materials.

         <title>Antigen Delivery Controlled by an On&#8208;Demand Photorelease</title>

The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) shuttles peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for the loading of Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we established an approach to precisely control antigen transport by light. Upon a photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens, we investigated peptide translocation by single&#8208;organelle recordings within the native peptide loading complex (PLC) containing TAP.







Abstract
To eliminate infected and cancerous cells, antigen processing and presentation play a pivotal role through the recognition of antigenic peptides displayed on Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we developed a photostimulated antigen release system that enables the temporal inception of antigen flux. Simple and effective photocaging of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope, a representative high&#8208;affinity MHC&#8197;I ligand, was provided by steric hindrance to block the recognition by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the peptide loading complex (PLC). In response to light, a heteronomous release of antigens and subsequent translocation in various scenarios is demonstrated, including a TAP&#8208;related ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporter reconstituted in liposomes and the native PLC in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of human cells. The photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens opens new opportunities for a mechanistic analysis of the antigen translocation machinery and will help to provide insights into antigen processing pathways via an on&#8208;demand, subcellular pulse&#8208;chase release of antigens.

         <title>Fluorine Doping Mediated Epitaxial Growth of NaREF4 on TiO2 for Boosting NIR Light Utilization in Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine doping&#8208;mediated epitaxial growth strategy was developed for the synthesis of TiO2&#8208;NaREF4 heteronanocrystals (HNCs). Due to the epitaxial growth connection, NaREF4 can transfer energy through phonon&#8208;assisted pathway to TiO2, which is more efficient than the traditional indirect secondary photon excitation.







Abstract
By integrating TiO2 with rare earth upconversion nanocrystals (NaREF4), efficient energy transfer can be achieved between the two subunits under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation, which hold tremendous potential in the fields of photocatalysis, photodynamic therapy (PDT), etc. However, in the previous studies, the combination of TiO2 with NaREF4 is a non&#8208;epitaxial random blending mode, resulting in a diminished energy transfer efficiency between the NaREF4 and TiO2. Herein, we present a fluorine doping&#8208;mediated epitaxial growth strategy for the synthesis of TiO2&#8208;NaREF4 heteronanocrystals (HNCs). Due to the epitaxial growth connection, NaREF4 can transfer energy through phonon&#8208;assisted pathway to TiO2, which is more efficient than the traditional indirect secondary photon excitation. Additionally, F doping brings oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 subunit, which further introduces new impurity energy levels in the intrinsic band gap of TiO2 subunit, and facilitates the energy transfer through phonon&#8208;assisted method from NaREF4 to TiO2. As a proof of concept, TiO2&#8208;NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Tm@NaYF4@NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;Nd@NaYF4 HNCs were rationally constructed. Taking advantage of the dual&#8208;model up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence of the delicately designed multi&#8208;shell structured NaREF4 subunit, highly efficient photo&#8208;response capability of the F&#8208;doped TiO2 subunit and the efficient phonon&#8208;assisted energy transfer between them, the prepared HNCs provide a distinctive nanoplatform for bioimaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;triggered PDT.

Due to the epitaxial growth connection, NaREF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can transfer energy through phonon-assisted pathway to TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is more efficient than the traditional indirect secondary photon excitation. Additionally, F doping brings oxygen vacancies in the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunit, which further introduces new impurity energy levels in the intrinsic band gap of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunit, and facilitates the energy transfer through phonon-assisted method from NaREF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a proof of concept, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NaGdF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Tm@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NaGdF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Nd@NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; HNCs were rationally constructed. Taking advantage of the dual-model up- and downconversion luminescence of the delicately designed multi-shell structured NaREF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; subunit, highly efficient photo-response capability of the F-doped TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunit and the efficient phonon-assisted energy transfer between them, the prepared HNCs provide a distinctive nanoplatform for bioimaging-guided NIR-triggered PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Enriched Alginate&#8211;Graphene Hydrogel Microreactor for Enhanced Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>

This study establishes a graphene&#8211;alginate hydrogel system cross&#8208;linked by metal ions M(n), addressing the challenges of insufficient proton supply and stable detachment of the intermediate *OOH in photocatalytic ORR reactions. The alginate framework facilitates proton relay, while the role of metal ions was evident through Lewis acidity&#8208;dependent activity for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of H2O2 via photocatalytic oxygen reduction without sacrificial agents is challenging due to inadequate proton supply from water and difficulty in maintaining O&#8722;O bond during O2 activation. Herein, we developed a straightforward strategy involving a proton&#8208;rich hydrogel cross&#8208;linked by metal ions [M(n)], which is designed to facilitate the selective production of H2O2 through proton relay and metal ion&#8208;assisted detachment of crucial intermediates. The hydrogel comprises CdS/graphene and alginate cross&#8208;linked by metal ions via O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds. Efficient O2 reduction and hydrogenation occurred, benefitting from the collaboration between proton&#8208;rich alginate and the photocatalytically active CdS/graphene. Meanwhile, the O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds enhance the electron density of &#945;&#8208;carbon sites on graphene, crucial for O2 activation and *OOH intermediate detachment, preventing deeper O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The role of metal ions in promoting *OOH desorption was demonstrated through Lewis acidity&#8208;dependent activity, with Y(III) having the highest activity, followed by Lu(III), La(III), and Ca(II).

         <title>An Asymmetric Coumarin&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate as Efficient Fullerene&#8208;Free Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;band gap coumarin&#8208;anthracene&#8208;based D&#8208;A dyad was designed and synthesized. The molecule when applied as an acceptor into PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF blend exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.91&#8201;% in ternary organic solar cells.







Abstract
Asymmetric wide&#8208;band gap fullerene&#8208;free acceptors (FFAs) play a crucial role in organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized a simple asymmetric coumarin&#8208;anthracene conjugate named CA&#8208;CN with optical band gap of 2.1&#8197;eV in a single&#8208;step condensation reaction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis confirms various multiple intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. The molecular orbital energy levels of CA&#8208;CN estimated from cyclic voltammetry were found to be suitable for its use as an acceptor for OSCs. Binary OSCs fabricated using CA&#8208;CN as acceptor and PTB7&#8208;Th as the donor achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.13&#8201;%. We further demonstrate that the insertion of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of CA&#8208;CN as a third component in ternary OSCs with PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF as the host material achieved an impressive PCE of 14.91&#8201;%, an improvement of ~43&#8201;% compared to the PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;DICTF binary device (10.38&#8201;%). Importantly, the ternary blend enhances the absorption coverage from 400 to 800&#8197;nm and improves the morphology of the active layer. The findings highlight the efficacy of an asymmetric design approach for FFAs, which paves the way for developing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs at low cost.

         <title>Carbonate Ester&#8208;Based Sodium Metal Battery with High&#8208;Capacity Retention at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C Enabled by Weak Solvents and Electrodeposited Anode</title>

This work proposes a new approach to achieving an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature carbonate ester&#8208;based sodium metal battery working at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, which is benefited from a wide liquid&#8208;range electrolyte and an electrodeposited Na (Cu/Na) anode with stable inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have received increasing attention due to the abundant sodium resources and high energy density, but suffered from the sluggish interfacial kinetic and unstable plating/stripping of sodium anode at low temperature, especially when matched with ester electrolytes. Here, we develop a stable ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature SMBs with high&#8208;capacity retention at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C in a weak solvated carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte, combined with an electrodeposited Na (Cu/Na) anode. The Cu/Na anode with electrochemically activated &#8220;deposited sodium&#8221; and stable inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is favor for the fast Na+ migration, therefore accelerating the interfacial kinetic process. As a result, the Cu/Na||NaCrO2 battery exhibited the highest capacity retention (compared to room&#8208;temperature capacity) in carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs (98.05&#8201;% at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, 91.3&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, 87.9&#8201;% at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C, respectively). The cyclic stability of 350 cycles at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C with a high energy efficiency of 96.15&#8201;% and 70 cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C can be achieved. Even in chill atmospheric environment with the fluctuant temperature, the battery can still operate over one month. This work provides a new opportunity for the development of low&#8208;temperature carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Halo&#8208;Halodifluoromethylation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Fluorinated Carboxylic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component halo&#8208;halofluoroalkylation of alkenes/alkynes using fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides and alkali metal halides was developed, enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF2X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups with the desired combination of X and X&#8217;. The reactivity of the resulting products as building blocks was examined, and the detailed reaction mechanism was discussed with a focus on the ligand effect.







Abstract
Polyhalogenated molecules are often found as bioactive compounds in nature and are used as synthetic building blocks. Fluoroalkyl compounds hold promise for the development of novel pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups is known to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability, and metabolic stability. Three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;halo&#8208;halodifluoromethylation reactions of alkenes are useful for their synthesis. However, general methods enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF2X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups in the desired combination of X and X&#8217; are lacking. To address this gap, for the first time, we report a three&#8208;component halo&#8208;halodifluoromethylation of alkenes and alkynes using combinations of commercially available fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides ((CF2XCO)2O, X=Cl and Br) and alkali metal halides (X&#8217;=Cl and Br). In situ prepared fluorinated diacyl peroxides were identified as important intermediates, and the use of appropriate bipyridyl&#8208;based ligands and a copper catalyst was essential for achieving high product selectivity. The synthetic utility of the polyhalogenated products was demonstrated by exploiting differences in the reactivities of their C&#8722;X and C&#8722;X&#8217; bonds to achieve selective derivatization.

     alt="Ligand-Controlled Copper-Catalyzed Halo-Halodifluoromethylation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Fluorinated Carboxylic Anhydrides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cu-catalyzed three-component halo-halofluoroalkylation of alkenes/alkynes using fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides and alkali metal halides was developed, enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups with the desired combination of X and X&#8217;. The reactivity of the resulting products as building blocks was examined, and the detailed reaction mechanism was discussed with a focus on the ligand effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyhalogenated molecules are often found as bioactive compounds in nature and are used as synthetic building blocks. Fluoroalkyl compounds hold promise for the development of novel pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups is known to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability, and metabolic stability. Three-component 1,2-halo-halodifluoromethylation reactions of alkenes are useful for their synthesis. However, general methods enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups in the desired combination of X and X&#8217; are lacking. To address this gap, for the first time, we report a three-component halo-halodifluoromethylation of alkenes and alkynes using combinations of commercially available fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides ((CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;XCO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, X=Cl and Br) and alkali metal halides (X&#8217;=Cl and Br). In situ prepared fluorinated diacyl peroxides were identified as important intermediates, and the use of appropriate bipyridyl-based ligands and a copper catalyst was essential for achieving high product selectivity. The synthetic utility of the polyhalogenated products was demonstrated by exploiting differences in the reactivities of their C&#8722;X and C&#8722;X&#8217; bonds to achieve selective derivatization. Finally, the reaction mechanism and ligand effect were investigated using experimental and theoretical methods to provide important insights for the further development of catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Solvent Coordination Enables Comprehensive Trap Passivation for Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a ligand/anti&#8208;solvent coordination strategy to resurface the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perovskite quantum dots. The short and conductive agent dissolved in the antisolvent improved conductivity and ensured well passivation. We fabricate NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) with these high&#8208;mobility and trap&#8208;free films, and achieved an EQE of ~21&#8201;%. We further demonstrate that this strategy applies to large&#8208;area NIR LEDs up to 900&#8197;mm2.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have produced external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~15&#8201;%. However, these high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;QLEDs suffer from immediate carrier quenching because of the accumulation of migratable ions at the surface of the QDs. These uncoordinated ions and carriers&#8212;if not bound to the nanocrystal surface&#8212;serve as centers for exciton quenching and device degradation. In this work, we overcome this issue and fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR QLEDs by devising a ligand anchoring strategy, which entails dissolving the strong&#8208;binding ligand (Guanidine Hydroiodide, GAI) in the mediate&#8208;polar solvent. By employing the dye&#8208;sensitized device structure (phosphorescent indicator), we demonstrate the elimination of the interface defects. The treated QDs films exhibit an exciton binding energy of 117&#8197;meV: this represents a 1.5&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the control (74&#8197;meV). We report, as a result, the NIR QLEDs with an EQE of 21&#8201;% which is a record among NIR perovskite QLEDs. These QLEDs also exhibit a 7&#8208;fold higher operational stability than that of the best previously reported NIR QLEDs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QDs are compatible with large&#8208;area QLEDs: we showcase 900&#8197;mm2 QLEDs with EQE approaching 20&#8201;%.

The Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cascade &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H diarylation of free carboxylic acids using bidentate chiral mono&#8208;protected amino thioether ligands (MPAThio), enabling one&#8208;step synthesis of a complex chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrene scaffolds with high enantioselectivity was presented. In this process, two methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and three C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds were activated, leading to the formation of four C&#8722;C bonds and three chiral centers in one pot. Mechanistic studies revealed the intermediacy and crucial role of chiral &#946;,&#947;&#8208;cyclohexene derived from enantioselective &#946;,&#947;&#8208;dehydrogenation as a norbornene&#8208;type reagent, orchestrating two successive Catellani reactions to furnish chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrenes.







Abstract
Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a versatile platform for constructing point, axial, and planar chirality. Herein, we present an unexpected discovery of a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cascade &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H diarylation of free carboxylic acids using bidentate chiral mono&#8208;protected amino thioether ligands (MPAThio), enabling one&#8208;step synthesis of a complex chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrene scaffolds with high enantioselectivity. In this process, two methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and three C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds were activated, leading to the formation of four C&#8722;C bonds and three chiral centers in one pot. A plausible catalytic pathway starts with enantioselective &#946;,&#947;&#8208;dehydrogenation to form chiral &#946;,&#947;&#8208;cyclohexene. Intriguingly, this olefin serves as a norbornene&#8208;type reagent (presumably assisted by the carboxyl directing effect), relaying two successive Catellani arylation reactions and a C&#8722;H arylation reaction to furnish chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrenes along with meta&#8208;selective homocoupling products of iodoarene.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Evolution of Ethanolamine upon Microhydration: Insights from Hyperfine Resolved Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
How many water molecules are needed to dissolve a base molecule? Using rotational spectroscopy, we explored the electronic environment of the &#8722;NH2 group in ethanolamine under microhydration. By measuring the 14N nuclear&#8208;spin quadrupole coupling, we found a strong correlation between the ionicity of &#8722;NH2 and nearby hydrogen bonds, pushing it towards the &#8722;NH3+ configuration.







Abstract
Ethanolamine hydrates containing from one to seven water molecules were identified via rotational spectroscopy with the aid of accurate quantum chemical methods considering anharmonic vibrational corrections. Ethanolamine undergoes significant conformational changes upon hydration to form energetically favorable hydrogen bond networks. The final structures strongly resemble the pure (H2O)3&#8211;9 complexes reported before when replacing two water molecules by ethanolamine. The 14N nuclear quadrupole coupling constants of all the ethanolamine hydrates have been determined and show a remarkable correlation with the strength of hydrogen bonds involving the amino group. After addition of the seventh water molecule, both hydrogen atoms of the amino group actively contribute to hydrogen bond formation, reinforcing the network and introducing approximately 21&#8211;27&#8201;% ionicity towards the formation of protonated amine. These findings highlight the critical role of microhydration in altering the electronic environment of ethanolamine, enhancing our understanding of amine hydration dynamics.

         <title>Tailoring Metallosupramolecular Glycoassemblies for Enhancing Lectin Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular approach to the design of structurally precise glyconanoassemblies that leverages the versatility, tunability and modularity of subcomponent self&#8208;assembly is described. Structural and electronic changes in ligand architecture enable a systematic method for understanding intricate structure&#8211;activity relationships governing multivalent lectin binding, thus offering insights into optimizing molecular recognition through synthetic design.







Abstract
Multivalency is a fundamental principle in nature that leads to high&#8208;affinity intermolecular recognition through multiple cooperative interactions that overcome the weak binding of individual constituents. For example, multivalency plays a critical role in lectin&#8208;carbohydrate interactions that participate in many essential biological processes. Designing high&#8208;affinity multivalent glycoconjugates that engage lectins results in systems with the potential to disrupt these biological processes, offering promising applications in therapeutic design and bioengineering. Here, a versatile and tunable synthetic platform for the synthesis of metallosupramolecular glycoassemblies is presented that leverages subcomponent self&#8208;assembly, which employs metal ion templates to generate complex supramolecular architectures from simple precursors in one pot. Through ligand design, this approach provides precise control over molecular parameters such as size, shape, flexibility, valency, and charge, which afforded a diverse family of well&#8208;defined hybrid glyconanoassemblies. Evaluation of these complexes as multivalent binders to Concanavalin&#8197;A (Con&#8197;A) by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) demonstrates the optimal saccharide tether length and the effect of electrostatics on protein affinity, revealing insights into the impact of synthetic design on molecular recognition.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular approach to the design of structurally precise glyconanoassemblies that leverages the versatility, tunability and modularity of subcomponent self-assembly is described. Structural and electronic changes in ligand architecture enable a systematic method for understanding intricate structure&#8211;activity relationships governing multivalent lectin binding, thus offering insights into optimizing molecular recognition through synthetic design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multivalency is a fundamental principle in nature that leads to high-affinity intermolecular recognition through multiple cooperative interactions that overcome the weak binding of individual constituents. For example, multivalency plays a critical role in lectin-carbohydrate interactions that participate in many essential biological processes. Designing high-affinity multivalent glycoconjugates that engage lectins results in systems with the potential to disrupt these biological processes, offering promising applications in therapeutic design and bioengineering. Here, a versatile and tunable synthetic platform for the synthesis of metallosupramolecular glycoassemblies is presented that leverages subcomponent self-assembly, which employs metal ion templates to generate complex supramolecular architectures from simple precursors in one pot. Through ligand design, this approach provides precise control over molecular parameters such as size, shape, flexibility, valency, and charge, which afforded a diverse family of well-defined hybrid glyconanoassemblies. Evaluation of these complexes as multivalent binders to Concanavalin&#8197;A (Con&#8197;A) by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) demonstrates the optimal saccharide tether length and the effect of electrostatics on protein affinity, revealing insights into the impact of synthetic design on molecular recognition. The presented studies offer an enhanced understanding of structure-function relationships governing lectin-saccharide interactions at the molecular level and guide a systematic approach towards optimizing glyconanoassembly binding parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsically Flexible Phase Change Fibers for Intelligent Thermal Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents intrinsically flexible solid&#8208;solid phase change fibers through wet&#8208;spinning for the first time. The fibers also exhibit excellent knittability, dyeability, recyclability, heat&#8208;induced shape recovery, washing resistance, and long&#8208;term thermal cycle stability. This intrinsically flexible phase change fiber has promising application prospects in wearable intelligent thermal management.







Abstract
Owing to the significant latent heat generated at constant temperatures, phase change fibers (PCFs) have recently received much attention in the field of wearable thermal management. However, the phase change materials involved in the existing PCFs still experience a solid&#8211;liquid transition process, severely restricting their practicality as wearable thermal management materials. Herein, we, for the first time, developed intrinsically flexible PCFs (polyethylene glycol/4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) fibers, PMFs) through polycondensation and wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting an inherent solid&#8208;solid phase transition property, adjustable phase transition behaviors, and outstanding knittability. The PMFs also present superior mechanical strength (28&#8197;MPa), washability (&gt;100 cycles), thermal cycling stability (&gt;2000 cycles), facile dyeability, and heat&#8208;induced recoverability, all of which are highly significant for practical wearable applications. Additionally, the PMFs can be easily recycled by directly dissolving them in solvents for reprocessing, revealing promising applications as sustainable materials for thermal management. Most importantly, the applicability of the PMFs was demonstrated by knitting them into permeable fabrics, which exhibit considerably improved thermal management performance compared with the cotton fabric. The PMFs offer great potential for intelligent thermal regulation in smart textiles and wearable electronics.

         <title>Dilute Electrolytes with Fluorine&#8208;Free Ether Solvents for 4.5&#8197;V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through salt modulation, high oxidation stability can be achieved for a 0.8&#8197;M dilute electrolyte consisting of a single fluorine (F)&#8208;free ether solvent. The boron (B)&#8208;containing cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by the salt decomposition enable stable cycling of lithium metal batteries with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode at the voltage range of 3&#8211;4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
The limited oxidation stability of ether solvents has posed significant challenges for their applications in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To tackle this issue, the prevailing strategy either adopts a high concentration of fluorinated salts or relies on highly fluorinated solvents, which will significantly increase the manufacturing cost and create severe environmental hazards. Herein, an alternative and sustainable salt engineering approach is proposed to enable the utilization of dilute electrolytes consisting of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The proposed 0.8&#8197;M electrolyte supports stable lithium plating&#8208;stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47&#8201;% and effectively mitigates the metal dissolution, phase transition, and gas release issues of the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode upon charging to high voltages. Consequently, the 4.5&#8197;V high&#8208;loading Li||NCM 811&#8197;cell shows a capacity retention of 75.2&#8201;% after 300 cycles. Multimodal experimental characterizations coupled with theoretical investigations demonstrate that the boron&#8208;containing salt plays a pivotal role in forming the passivation layers on both anode and cathode. The present simple and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for using commercially mature, environmentally benign, and low&#8208;cost F&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Potent and Selective Oxidatively Labile Ether&#8208;Based Prodrugs through Late&#8208;Stage Boronate Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage alkene functionalization reactions can be used to convert non&#8208;biologically active entities into boron&#8208;containing cancer cell&#8208;selective toxins. The rapid cleavage of borylallyl groups in the presence of peroxide allows for the use of ether&#8208;based prodrugs for oxidatively stressed cells. The utility of ethers in de novo prodrug synthesis is demonstrated through the conversion of a protecting group into an oxidatively cleavable group.







Abstract
This manuscript describes a new strategy for prodrug synthesis in which a relatively inert ether group is introduced at an early stage in a synthetic sequence and functionalized in the final step to introduce a prodrug&#8208;activating group through a chemoselective process. Boryl allyloxy (BAO) ether groups are synthesized through several metal&#8208;mediated processes to form entities that are readily cleaved under oxidative conditions commonly found in cancer cells. The high cleavage propensity of the BAO group allows for ether cleavage, making these compounds substantially more hydrolytically stable in comparison to acyl&#8208;linked prodrugs while retaining the ability to release alcohols. We report the preparation of prodrug analogues of the natural products camptothecin and pederin from acetal precursors that serve as protecting groups in their synthetic sequences. The BAO acetal groups cleave in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to release the cytotoxic agents. The pederin&#8208;based prodrug shows dramatically greater cytotoxicity than negative controls and outstanding selectivity and potency toward cancer cell lines in comparison to non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. This late&#8208;stage functionalization approach to prodrug synthesis should be applicable to numerous systems that can be accessed through chemoselective processes.

Organic electroltyte of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries is utilized as fluorine source to in situ fluorinate the 3D porous Cu foam through a facile and mild solvothermal method. Benefiting from the protective solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cross&#8208;linked sodium alginate (SA) layer, the optimized CuF2@void@SEI@SA cathode with pomegranate&#8208;like (yolk&#8208;shell) structure exhibits large specific capacity and superb cycling stability. This work not only provides new options for exploiting novel materials for large&#8208;scale high&#8208;density energy storage, the combined utilization of organic electrolyte of spent LIBs also realizes the unity of environmental, social and economic benefits.







Abstract
With the large&#8208;scale application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a huge amount of spent LIBs will be generated each year and how to realize their recycling and reuse in a clean and effective way poses a challenge to the society. In this work, using the electrolyte of spent LIBs as solvent, we in situ fluorinate the conductive three&#8208;dimensional porous copper foam by a facile solvent&#8208;thermal method and then coating it with a cross&#8208;linked sodium alginate (SA) layer. Benefiting from the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that accommodating the volume change of internal CuF2 core and SA layer that inhibiting the dissolution of CuF2, the synthesized CuF2@void@SEI@SA cathode with a pomegranate&#8208;like structure (yolk&#8208;shell) exhibits a large reversible capacity of ~535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superb cycling stability. This work conforms to the development concept of green environmental protection and comprehensively realizes the unity of environmental, social and economic benefits.

         <title>Highly Anion&#8208;Conductive Viologen&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes as Nanopower Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane that can simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, possessing great positive charge density and abundant ion transport nanochannels. Benefitting from the tailored pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, it demonstrates an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 and maintains a substantial anion selectivity of 0.70, as a result, it realizes a remarkable power density of 55&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) membranes hold great potential for harvesting sustainable osmotic energy. The nascent research has yet to simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, primarily due to inefficient ion transport dynamics. This is directly related to ultrasmall pore size (&lt;3&#8197;nm), much smaller than the duple Debye length in the diluted electrolyte (6&#8211;20&#8197;nm), as well as low charge density (&lt;4.5&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2). Here, we introduce a &#960;&#8208;conjugated viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane possessing a large pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, strategically enhancing the overlapping of the electric double layer, coupled with an exceptional positive surface charge density (~6&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2). These characteristics enable the membrane to facilitate high anion flux while maintaining ideal selectivity. Notably, V2DP membranes realize an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2, surpassing benchmarks set by previously reported nanofluidic membranes. In the practical application scenario involving the mixing of artificial seawater and river water, the V2DP membranes exhibit a considerable ion transference number of 0.70 towards Cl&#8722;, contributing to an outstanding power density of ~55&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal the important role of the large quantity of anion transport sites, which act as binding sites evenly located in the positively charged N&#8208;containing pyridine rings. These binding sites enable kinematic coupling and decoupling between anions and the V2DP skeleton, establishing a continuous Cl&#8722; ion transport pathway. This work demonstrates the great promise of large&#8208;area ultrathin 2DP membranes featuring highly organized charged ion transport networks when applied for osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>The Coking of a Solid Catalyst Rationalized with Combined Raman and Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined Raman, fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime microscopy allows to study the coke formation process of an industrial equilibrium catalyst for fluid catalytic cracking. The changing fluorescence dynamics, together with extensive coke graphitization observed during in situ coking experiments with hexane as feedstock show that combining these three microscopy techniques provides a detailed physicochemical picture of the coking of a highly complex hydrocarbon conversion catalyst.







Abstract
The formation of carbon deposits is a major deactivation pathway for solid catalysts. Studying coking on industrially relevant catalysts is, however, often challenging due to the sample heterogeneity. That is especially true for zeolite&#8208;containing catalysts where fluorescence often hampers their characterization with Raman spectroscopy. We turned this disadvantage into an advantage and combined Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy to study the coking behavior of an equilibrium catalyst material used for fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. The results presented illustrate that this approach can yield new insights in the physicochemical processes occurring within zeolite&#8208;containing catalyst particles during their coking process. Ex situ analyses of single catalyst particles revealed considerable intra&#8208;sample heterogeneities. The sample&#8208;averaged Raman spectra showed a higher degree of graphitization when the sample was exposed to more hexane, while the sample&#8208;averaged fluorescence lifetime showed no significant trend. Simultaneous in situ Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy, used to follow the coking and the regeneration of single particles, gave more insights in the changing fluorescence dynamics. During the coking, the rise and decline of the average fluorescence lifetime suggested the prolonged presence of smaller coke species that are quenched more and more by adjacent larger polyaromatics acting as F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance&#8208;energy&#8208;transfer acceptors.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Combined with Chirality&#8208;Selective Absorption for Modulating Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes a novel and universal strategy which combines circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP&#8208;ET) with chirality&#8208;selective absorption (CSA) of chiral polyacetylenes to construct full&#8208;color tunable circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA). According to the strategy, full&#8208;color and white CPLA films with afterglow lasting for more than 20&#8197;min are prepared.







Abstract
Circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA) attracts great interests in multi&#8208;disciplinary fields with significant potentials in optical multiplexing applications, but achieving full&#8208;color and white CPLA is still challenging. The present contribution reports the first success in utilizing circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP&#8208;ET) combined with chirality&#8208;selective absorption (CSA) to construct full&#8208;color and white CPLA materials. Blue CPLA with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 3&#215;10&#8722;2 is firstly obtained via the CSA effect of chiral helical polyacetylene and blue ultralong afterglow of inorganic phosphor BP. Significantly, full&#8208;color and white CPLA films are prepared by simply blending different fluorophores into the blue&#8208;CPLA films via CPP&#8208;ET. Benefited from the persistent luminescence of BP, the lifetimes of the fluorophores increase from nanoseconds to minutes, and ultralong full&#8208;color CPLA emissions lasting for more than 20&#8197;min are realized with glum of 10&#8722;3. Also noticeably, chiral optoelectronic devices, multi&#8208;dimension information encryption and chiral logic gate are developed based on the full&#8208;color tunable CPLA&#8208;active materials. The established strategy provides a universal platform for future development of CPLA&#8208;active materials with great applications.

         <title>Pomotrelvir and Nirmatrelvir Binding and Reactivity with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease: Implications for Resistance Mechanisms from Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the inhibition mechanism of pomotrelvir against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, using MM and QM/MM simulations and free energy calculations. Transforming pomotrelvir's groups to those in nirmatrelvir revealed that tertiary amines are favored at P2, while flexible side chains at this position may disrupt active site organization. These insights may aid in designing improved inhibitors for current and future SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants.







Abstract
We investigate the inhibition mechanism between pomotrelvir and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. Alchemical transformations where each Pi group of pomotrelvir was transformed into its counterpart in nirmatrelvir were performed to unravel the individual contribution of each group to the binding and reaction processes. We have shown that while a &#947;&#8208;lactam ring is preferred at position P1, a &#948;&#8208;lactam ring is a good alternative for the design of inhibitors for variants presenting mutations at position&#8197;166. For the P2 position, tertiary amines are preferred with respect to secondary amines. Flexible side chains at the P2 position can disrupt the preorganization of the active site, favouring the exploration of non&#8208;reactive conformations. The substitution of the P2&#8197;group of pomotrelvir by that of nirmatrelvir resulted in a compound, named as C2, that presents a better binding free energy and a higher population of reactive conformations in the Michaelis complex. Analysis of the chemical reaction to form the covalent complex has shown a similar reaction mechanism and activation free energies for pomotrelvir, nirmatrelvir and C2. We hope that these findings could be useful to design better inhibitors to fight present and future variants of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.

         <dc:description>
An innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited for the first time through TA&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source to prepare high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films. This strategy regulates the energy level structures to produce a favourable energy band structure, suppressing hole&#8208;transport energy level barrier and amplifying electron&#8208;transport driving force. The champion Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ solar cell displays an considerable efficiency of 9.28&#8201;% with the highest Voc of 0.70&#8197;V (&#951;&gt;9.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3), featuring large absorption coefficient, excellent crystal structure stability, benign non&#8208;toxic characteristic, outstanding humidity and ultraviolet tolerability, has recently attracted enormous attention and research interest regarding its photoelectric conversion properties. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) for Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is relatively low, especially for the device with a high power conversion efficiency (&#951;). Herein, an innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited to produce high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films on TiO2/CdS substrates through a thioacetamide(TA)&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source hydrothermal&#8208;processed method. The Se&#8208;elemental gradient distribution produces a favorable energy band structure, which suppresses the energy level barriers for hole transport and enhances the driving force for electron transport in Sb2(S,Se)3 film. This facilitates efficient charge transport/separation of photogenerated carriers and boosts significantly the Voc of Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaic devices. The champion TA&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cell displays an considerable &#951; of 9.28&#8201;% accompanied by an exciting Voc rising to 0.70&#8197;V that is currently the highest among Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 9.0&#8201;%. This research is anticipated to contribute to the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film and the achievement of efficient inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ photovoltaic device.

         <title>A Versatile Reversible, Degenerative Chain Transfer Mechanism for the Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The typical termination procedure of a ROMP polymerization leaves with a methylene group at the polymer chain end. Here, we show that such end groups are capable of further reversible exchange between themselves when treated with catalytic amount of Grubbs catalysts under slow monomer addition condition. This newly discovered exchange mechanism uses inexpensive styrenes as the chain transfer agents for catalytic living ROMP to produce complex polymeric architectures.







Abstract
Most metathesis polymers based on norbornene derivatives carry a vinyl end group. Here we show that these vinyl end groups readily undergo a degenerative exchange of the terminal methylene unit in the presence of sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of a propagating metathesis polymer carrying a Grubbs ruthenium complex. We show that this degenerative exchange can be exploited in synthesizing ROMP polymers in a catalytic living fashion. Chain transfer agents based on styrene, or monosubstituted conjugated 1,3&#8197;diene derivatives are used as initiating sites for the catalytic living polymerization. Suitable derivatives of these chain transfer agents not only allow the linear living growth of polymers but also the synthesis of block copolymers from macro&#8208;initiators or star polymers from multi&#8208;functional chain transfer agents. This reversible exchange mechanism offers a cheaper, greener, and more sustainable alternative for the synthesis of living ROMP polymers compared to the classical synthetic route.

         <title>Half&#8208;Curcumin&#8208;Based Chemiluminescence Probes and Their Applications in Detecting Quasi&#8208;Stable Oxidized Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;curcumin analogue, CRANAD&#8208;164, was developed as a novel chemiluminescence probe. It is sensitive to quasi&#8208;stable oxidized proteins with strong chemiluminescence emission, which could be exploited for in vivo liver imaging and in vitro blood tests.







Abstract
Numerous methods have been reported for detecting ROS/RNS in vitro and in vivo; however, detecting methods for the secondary products of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) reactions, particularly quasi&#8208;stable oxidized products, have been much less explored. In this report, we observed that half&#8208;curcumins could generate chemiluminescence (CL). In contrast to other chemiluminescence scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of a half&#8208;curcumin is the formation of a carbanion intermediate of its acetylacetone moiety, opening unique avenues for applications. In this study, we designed a series of half&#8208;curcumins CRANAD&#8208;Xs and found that CRANAD&#8208;164 could be used to detect quasi&#8208;stable oxidized proteins (QSOP) in vivo and in patient serum samples. We illustrated that CRANAD&#8208;164 could be used to monitor the responses of taurine, an amino acid with newly reported anti&#8208;aging capacity, in an inflammatory mouse model. Remarkably, we further demonstrated that the QSOP levels were much higher in the disease serum samples, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared to the samples from healthy controls. Moreover, our results revealed that the sera chemiluminescence intensities were higher in aged healthy controls compared to young healthy subjects, suggesting that CRANAD&#8208;164 can be used to monitor the increase of QSOP during aging.

         <title>Spatially Confined Engineering Toward Deep Eutectic Electrolyte in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a novel solid&#8208;state Zn2+ conductor by confining deep eutectic electrolytes into the nanochannels of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is proposed. The obtained DEE@PCN&#8208;222 solid state electrolyte exhibits appreciable Zn2+ conductivity and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping ability with long&#8208;term stability. DEE@PCN&#8208;222&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ZIBs achieved favorable reversibility and effective protection of electrodes.







Abstract
Uncontrollable interfacial side reactions generated from common aqueous electrolytes, just like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, have severely prevented the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Solid&#8208;state ZIBs are considered to be an efficient strategy by adopting high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, by confining deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) into the nanochannels of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;PCN&#8208;222, a stable DEE@PCN&#8208;222 SSE with internal Zn2+ transport channels was obtained. A distinctive ion&#8208;transport network composed of DEE and PCN&#8208;222 in the interior of DEE@PCN&#8208;222 realizes the efficient Zn2+ conduction, contributing to high ionic conductivity of 3.13&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, low activation energy of 0.12&#8197;eV, and a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.74. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that DEE@PCN&#8208;222 with its unique channel structure could homogeneously regulate the Zn2+ distribution and effectively alleviate the side reactions. Highly reversible Zn plating/stripping performance of 2476&#8197;h can be realized by the SSE. The solid&#8208;state ZIBs show a specific capacity of 306&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and display cycling stability of 517&#8197;cycles. This unique design concept provides a new perspective in realizing the high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Pd2Lab2Lcc2 and Pd2Lab2Lcd2 Type Cages by Heteromeric Completive Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structurally complex biological systems, two highly anisotropic Pd(II)&#8208;based mixed ligated binuclear cages were self&#8208;assembled separately by integrative self&#8208;sorting of a binuclear cage with two different tetranuclear cages. Heteromeric completive self&#8208;sorting of the three homoleptic assemblies resulted exclusively in the simultaneous formation of the highly anisotropic cages.







Abstract
Pd(II)&#8208;based low&#8208;symmetry coordination cages possessing anisotropic cavities are of great interest. The common strategies employed to achieve such cages utilize either more than one type of symmetrical ligands (e.g., Laa, Lbb etc.) or only one type of unsymmetrical ligand (e.g., Lab). To significantly enhance the anisotropy, we have designed two unsymmetrical bidentate ligands i.e., Lab and Lcd, aiming at a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. It was accomplished by high&#8208;fidelity integrative self&#8208;sorting of two different low&#8208;symmetry cages having Pd2Lab4 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type architectures (homoleptic complexes of the designed ligands). Structural constraints and geometry complementarity in the ligand design drive the non&#8208;statistical exclusive self&#8208;assembly of the Pd2Lab2Lcd2&#8208;type cage. By taking advantage of the complemental geometries between ligands, a low&#8208;symmetry Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type cage was also obtained. Heteromeric completive self&#8208;sorting of three homoleptic assemblies (Pd2Lab4, Pd4Lcc8 and Pd4Lcd8&#8208;type cages) into an exclusive mixture of Pd2Lab2Lcd2 and Pd2Lab2Lcc2&#8208;type mixed ligated assemblies was demonstrated through cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Selenol&#8208;Yne Click (SYC) Reaction Enables Poly(selenoacetal) Covalent Adaptable Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a catalysis&#8208;free selenol&#8208;yne click reaction, we successfully synthesized polymers and dynamic materials. Selenoacetal&#8208;based materials exhibit exceptional reprocessing ability, self&#8208;healing properties, and recycling potential.







Abstract
The emergence of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) based on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) presents a promising avenue for achieving resource recovery and utilization. In this study, we discovered a dynamic covalent bond called selenacetal, which is obtained through a double click reaction between selenol and activated alkynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the &#916;G for the formation of selenoacetals ranges from 12 to 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, suggesting its potential for dynamic reversibility. Dynamic exchange experiments involving small molecules and polymers provide substantial evidence supporting the dynamic exchange properties of selenoacetals. By utilizing this highly efficient click reaction, we successfully synthesized dynamic materials based on selenoacetal with remarkable reprocessing capabilities without any catalysts. These materials exhibit chemical recycling under alkaline conditions, wherein selenoacetal (SA) can decompose into active enone selenide (ES) and diselenides. Reintroducing selenol initiates a renewed reaction with the enone selenide, facilitating material recycling and yielding a newly developed dynamic material exhibiting both photo&#8208; and thermal responsiveness. The results underscore the potential of selenoacetal polymers in terms of recyclability and selective degradation, making them a valuable addition to conventional covalent adaptable networks.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization in Ag&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) with strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) NH3 yield rate in electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction at ampere&#8208;level, which can be further extended to Struvite production and Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Mechanistic studies reveal that such p&#8211;d orbital hybridization in SnAg benefits nitrite deoxygenation, the rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis.







Abstract
Considering the substantial role of ammonia, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion has attracted increasing interest. Herein, we proposed a feasible strategy of p&#8211;d orbital hybridization via doping p&#8208;block metals in an Ag host, which drastically promotes the performance of nitrate adsorption and disassociation. Typically, a Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5&#177;1.85&#8201;% for NH3 at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3&#177;14.1&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2&#8201;% at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high&#8208;quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi&#8208; and In&#8208;doped Ag catalysts. Moreover, when integrated into a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, such a SnAg cathode contributes to a superior energy density of 639&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1, high power density of 18.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and continuous NH3 production.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Catalyzed Amide Synthesis Directly from Alcohol Under Red Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of amides from alcohols typically involves homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures (130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C). We report a COF&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative synthesis of amides under extremely low COF loading and red light irradiation to overcome these challenges. This method successfully produces a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, with good to excellent yields and notable recyclability.







Abstract
The dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines to form amide bonds is typically catalysed by homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures ranging from 130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C. In our pursuit of an efficient and recyclable photocatalyst capable of conducting this transformation at room temperature, we report herein a COF&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative synthesis. The TTT&#8208;DHTD COF was strategically designed to incorporate a high density of functional units, specifically dithiophenedione, to trap photogenerated electrons and effectively facilitate hydrogen atom abstraction reactions. The photoactive TTT&#8208;DHTD COF, synthesized using solvothermal methods showed high crystallinity and moderate surface area, providing an ideal platform for heterogeneous amide synthesis. Light absorption by the COF across the entire visible range, narrow band gap, and valence band position make it well&#8208;suited for the efficient generation of excitons necessary for targeted dehydrogenation. Utilizing red light irradiation and employing extremely low loading of the COF, we have successfully prepared a wide range of amides, including challenging secondary amides, in good to excellent yields. The substrates&#8217; functional group tolerance, very mild reaction conditions, and the catalyst's significant recyclability represent substantial advancements over prior methodologies.

&lt;p&gt;The direct synthesis of amides from alcohols typically involves homogeneous transition metal catalysts at high temperatures (130&#8211;140&#8201;&#176;C). We report a COF-mediated dehydrogenative synthesis of amides under extremely low COF loading and red light irradiation to overcome these challenges.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Polyurea Ionogel with Mechanical Robustness, Self&#8208;Healing, and Fluorescence Enabled by Hyperbranched Cluster Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the jellyfish, this study introduces a novel hierarchical crosslinking network architectural design strategy. It entails the in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA). Compared to the conventional dynamic crosslinked network structure of ionogel, this well&#8208;designed network imparts remarkable characteristics to the ionogel, including mechanical robustness (high strength, exceptional toughness, puncture resistance), low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence. This network design is promising for developing advanced soft iontronics.







Abstract
Ionogels are promising for soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining their performance and potential applications. However, simultaneously achieving mechanical toughness, low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence using existing network structures is challenging. Drawing inspiration from jellyfish, we propose a novel hierarchical crosslinking network structure design for in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA) to fabricate polyurea ionogels to overcome these challenges. Leveraging the disparate reactivity of isocyanate groups, we induce the in situ formation of HCA through competing reactions, enhancing toughness and imparting the clustering&#8208;triggered emission of ionogel. This synergy between supramolecular interactions in the network and plasticizing effect in ionic liquid leads to reduced hysteresis of the ionogel. Furthermore, the incorporation of NCO&#8208;terminated prepolymer with dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds (NPU) enables self&#8208;healing and enhances stretchability. Our investigations highlight the significant influence of HCA on ionogel performance, showcasing mechanical robustness including high strength (3.5&#8197;MPa), exceptional toughness (5.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), resistance to puncture, and low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, as well as fluorescence, surpassing conventional dynamic crosslinking approaches. This network design strategy is versatile and can meet the various demands of flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Mediated Modulation of Spatial Internal Stresses of Hydrogels for Complex 3D Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of polyelectrolytes and polymer networks is used to regulate the spatial stress of hydrogels to construct complex actuators with customized 3D initial shapes capable of reversible deformation in response to external stimuli.







Abstract
Hydrogel actuators with complex 3D initial shapes show numerous important applications, but it remains challenging to fabricate such actuators. This article describes a polyelectrolyte&#8208;based strategy for modulating small&#8208;scale internal stresses within hydrogels to construct complex actuators with tailored 3D initial shapes. Introducing polyelectrolytes into precursor solutions significantly enhances the volume shrinkage of hydrogel networks during polymerization, allowing us to modulate internal stresses. Photopolymerization of these polyelectrolyte&#8208;containing solutions through a mask produces mechanically strong hydrogel sheets with large patterned internal stresses. Consequently, these hydrogel sheets attain complex 3D initial shapes at equilibrium, in contrast to the planar initial configuration of 2D actuators. We demonstrate that these 3D actuators can reversibly transform into other 3D shapes (i.e., 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape transformations) in response to external stimuli. Additionally, we develop a predictive model based on the Flory&#8208;Rehner theory to analyze the polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated shrinking behaviors of hydrogel networks during polymerization, allowing precise modulation of shrinkage and internal stress. This polyelectrolyte&#8208;boosted shrinking mechanism paves a route to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance 3D hydrogel actuators.

         <title>Halogen Tailoring of Platinum Electrocatalyst with High CO Tolerance for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing platinum halogen (bromine) nanoparticles, and simultaneously bromine bond with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (PtBr NPs/Br&#8208;GDY) as a model catalyst, we show an electron&#8208;rich structure catalyst introduced by the ligand of bromine to improve the catalytic performance and high CO&#8208;resistant of platinum catalysts during methanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of platinum for CO oxidation depends on the interaction of electron donation and back&#8208;donation at the platinum center. Here we demonstrate that the platinum bromine nanoparticles with electron&#8208;rich properties on bromine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (PtBr NPs/Br&#8208;GDY), which is formed by bromine ligand and constitutes an electrocatalyst with a high CO&#8208;resistant for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst showed peak mass activity for MOR as high as 10.4&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1, which is 20.8&#8197;times higher than the 20&#8201;% Pt/C. The catalyst also showed robust long&#8208;term stability with slight current density decay after 100&#8197;hours at 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Structural characterization, experimental, and theoretical studies show that the electron donation from bromine makes the surface of platinum catalysts highly electron&#8208;rich, and can strengthen the adsorption of CO as well as enhance &#960; back&#8208;donation of Pt to weaken the C&#8722;O bond to facilitate CO electrooxidation and enhance catalytic performance during MOR. The results highlight the importance of electron&#8208;rich structure among active sites in Pt&#8208;halogen catalysts and provide detailed insights into the new mechanism of CO electrooxidation to overcome CO poisoning at the Pt center on an orbital level.

         <title>Ln3+ Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Chiral Heterometallic Clusters Ln2Ag28</title>

A series of 0D chiralclusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln=Gd) with TADF induced by the coordination of Ln3+ ions were prepared. In the absence of energy transfer between Ln3+ and Ag(I) hetero&#8208;metals, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8211;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions.







Abstract
A series of TADF&#8208;active compounds: 0D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) clusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln=Gd) has been synthesized. Atomic&#8208;level structural analysis showed that the chiral Ag(I) cluster units {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D exhibited similar configurations, linked by varying numbers of [Ln(H2O)x]3+ (x=6 for 0D, x=3 for 2D) to form the final target compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra and decay lifetimes measurement demonstrated the presence of TADF in L&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag14S12} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;Eu2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;0D. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag14S12} cluster units were induced by 4&#8201;f perturbation of Ln3+ ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8211;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster&#8208;based luminescent materials.

&lt;b&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Gd) with TADF induced by the coordination of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were prepared. In the absence of energy transfer between Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ag(I) hetero-metals, while maintaining &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) small enough, it can significantly increase &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of TADF-active compounds: 0D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) clusters &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) cluster-based frameworks &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Gd) has been synthesized. Atomic-level structural analysis showed that the chiral Ag(I) cluster units {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} in &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt; exhibited similar configurations, linked by varying numbers of [Ln(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=6 for 0D, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=3 for 2D) to form the final target compounds. Temperature-dependent emission spectra and decay lifetimes measurement demonstrated the presence of TADF in &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Eu/Gd) and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt;. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} in &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt; displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt;. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} cluster units were induced by 4&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; perturbation of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) small enough, it can significantly increase &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster-based luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confined Element Distribution with Structure&#8208;Driven Energy Coupling for Enhanced Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Irving&#8208;William order, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements at the M1 site of Prussian blue analogues, is proposed to restrain localized enrichment and release of stresses and induce structure&#8208;driven energy coupling phenomenon.







Abstract
The structural failure of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] could not be alleviated with traditional modification strategies through the adjustable composition property of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), considering that the accumulation and release of stress derived from the MnN6 octahedrons are unilaterally restrained. Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non&#8208;uniform distribution of elements at the M1 site of PBAs (NFM&#8208;PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving&#8208;William order. Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero&#8208;strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability. Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the enhanced electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM&#8208;PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitor of Factor Inhibiting HIF Binding to a Tyrosine&#8208;Flip Pocket for the Treatment of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tyrosine flip induced by ligand binding to factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) enables the development of the potent and selective FIH inhibitor ZG&#8208;2291, a useful probe for the physiological functions of FIH. FIH inhibition is identified as a promising strategy for obesity treatment.







Abstract
In animals, limiting oxygen upregulates the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF) and promotes a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that regulates HIF function by reducing its interaction with histone acetyl transferases. HIF levels are negatively regulated by the HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) which, like FIH, are 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) oxygenases. Genetic loss of FIH promotes both glycolysis and aerobic metabolism. FIH has multiple non&#8208;HIF substrates making it challenging to connect its biochemistry with physiology. A structure&#8211;mechanism guided approach identified a highly potent in vivo active FIH inhibitor, ZG&#8208;2291, the binding of which promotes a conformational flip of a catalytically important tyrosine, enabling the selective inhibition of FIH over other Jumonji C subfamily 2OG oxygenases. Consistent with genetic studies, ZG&#8208;2291 promotes thermogenesis and ameliorates symptoms of obesity and metabolic dysfunction in ob/ob mice. The results reveal ZG&#8208;2291 as a useful probe for the physiological functions of FIH and identify FIH inhibition as a promising strategy for obesity treatment.

         <title>Tailored Supramolecular Interactions in Host&#8211;Guest Complexation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipole moment of crown ethers indicates their supramolecular interactions with perovskites. Higher dipole moments enhance coordination with lead cations, improving film morphology and optoelectronic properties. Optimized host&#8211;guest complexation led to perovskite solar modules reaching a 21.5&#8201;% efficiency over 14.0&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexation offers a promising approach for mitigating surface defects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Crown ethers are the most widely used macrocyclic hosts for complexing perovskite surfaces, yet their supramolecular interactions and functional implications require further understanding. Here we show that the dipole moment of crown ethers serves as an indicator of supramolecular interactions with both perovskites and precursor salts. A larger dipole moment, achieved through the substitution of heteroatoms, correlates with enhanced coordination with lead cations. Perovskite films incorporating aza&#8208;crown ethers as additives exhibited improved morphology, reduced defect densities, and better energy&#8208;level alignment compared to those using native crown ethers. We report power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25&#8201;% for PSCs, which show enhanced long&#8208;term stability, and a record PCE of 21.5&#8201;% for host&#8211;guest complexation&#8208;based perovskite solar modules with an active area of 14.0&#8197;cm2.

         <title>Ring Contraction of Saturated Cyclic Amines and Rearrangement of Acyclic Amines Through Their Corresponding Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rearrangement promoted by a B(C6F5)3&#8208;hydrosilane pair enables the regioselective ring contraction of saturated cyclic hydroxylamines as well as the skeletal reorganization of acyclic derivatives. The method overcomes the limitations of traditional uncatalyzed Stieglitz rearrangements, allowing for swift structural transformations between different types of amines. The mechanism of this rearrangement is investigated by control experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Compared to modifications at the molecular periphery, skeletal adjustments present greater challenges. Within this context, skeletal rearrangement technology stands out for its significant advantages in rapidly achieving structural diversity. Yet, the development of this technology for ring contraction of saturated cyclic amines remains exceedingly rare. While most existing methods rely on specific substitution patterns to achieve ring contraction, there is a persistent demand for a more general strategy for substitution&#8208;free cyclic amines. To address this issue, we report a B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of hydroxylamines with hydrosilanes. This methodology, when combined with the N&#8208;hydroxylation of amines, enables the regioselective ring contraction of cyclic amines and proves equally effective for rapid reorganization of acyclic amine skeletons. By this, the direct scaffold hopping of drug molecules and the strategic deletion of carbon atoms are achieved in a mild manner. Based on mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, a possible mechanism for this process is proposed.

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Oxides for Electrocatalytic Acidic NOx&#8722; Reduction Streamlining Ammonia Synthesis from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>

The continuous production of NH3 is achieved from air and water by coupling the plasma system and MEA electrolyzer. The catalyst's unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen oxide ions reduction reaction (NOx&#8722;RR) shows great opportunity for ammonia production under ambient conditions. Yet, performing NOx&#8722;RR in strong acidic conditions remains challenging due to the corrosion effect on the catalyst and competing hydrogen evolution reactions. Here, we demonstrate a stable La1.5Sr0.5Ni0.5Fe0.5O4 perovskite oxide for the NOx&#8722;RR at pH&#8197;0, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for ammonia of approaching 100&#8201;% at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type cell. At industrially relevant current density, the NOx&#8722;RR system shows stable cell voltage and Faradaic efficiency for &gt;350&#8197;h in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at pH&#8197;0. By integrating the catalyst in a stacked MEA with a series connection, we have successfully obtained a record&#8208;breaking 2.578&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 NH3 production rate at 20&#8197;A. This catalyst&#8216;s unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources. Techno&#8208;economic and lifecycle assessments reveal substantial economic advantages for this ammonia production strategy, even when coupled with a plasma&#8208;based NOx production system, presenting a sustainable complement to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process.

         <title>Nanometer&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Organic Cation Migration Behavior in Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining with the surface sensitive heterodyne mode and volume sensitive homodyne mode of infrared photo induced force microscopy, the 3&#8208;dimensional organic ion migration behaviors in organic metal halide perovskite has been imaged with sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm resolution, revealing the bias&#8208;dependent transition of MA+ migration channels from grain boundaries to grains and allowing the calculation of MA+ drift velocity across GBs.







Abstract
The performance and stability of organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) optoelectronic devices have been associated with ion migration. Understanding of nanoscale resolved organic cation migration mechanism would facilitate structure engineering and commercialization of OMHP. Here, we report a three&#8208;dimensional approach for in situ nanoscale infrared imaging of organic ion migration behavior in OMHPs, enabling to distinguish migrations along grain boundary and in crystal lattice. Our results reveal that organic cation migration along OMHP film surface and grain boundaries (GBs) occurs at lower biases than in crystal lattice. We visualize the transition of organic cation migration channels from GBs to volume upon increasing electric field. The temporal resolved results demonstrate the fast MA+ migration kinetics at GBs, which is comparable to diffusivity of halide ions. Our findings help understand the role of organic cations in the performance of OMHP devices, and the proposed approach holds broad applicability for revealing migration mechanisms of organic ions in OMHPs based optoelectronic devices.

Hollow core&#8211;shell Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space was synthesized by one&#8208;step spray drying and calcination for the first time due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, ratios, and shrinkage rates between CA and PVP, which ensures high energy density and relieves volume expansion, combining with regulation on Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier by doping Ni to achieve fast charging and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core&#8211;shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space (THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni) via a one&#8208;step spray&#8208;drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieving volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron conductivity and optimize Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;C). Notably, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity of 43.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core&#8211;shelled structure with tiny&#8208;void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast&#8208;charge and low&#8208;temperature Na&#8208;storage features.

         <title>Modular and Diverse Synthesis of Acrylamides by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene towards important acrylamide derivatives is presented. The novel synthetic protocol shows high functional group&#8208;compatibility, high atom efficiency and good chemoselectivity to obtain a variety of bio&#8208;active compounds including several actual drugs.







Abstract
The development of all kinds of covalent drugs had a major impact on the improvement of the human health system. Covalent binding to target proteins is achieved by so&#8208;called electrophilic warheads, which are incorporated in the respective drug molecule. In the last decade, specifically acrylamides emerged as attractive warheads in covalent drug design. Herein, a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene has been developed, allowing a modular and diverse synthesis of bio&#8208;active acrylamides. This general protocol features high atom efficiency, wide functional group compatibility, high chemoselectivity and proceeds additive free under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utility of this protocol is showcased in the synthesis of ibrutinib, osimertinib, and other bio&#8208;active compound derivatives.

         <title>Development of a Dual&#8208;Factor Activatable Covalent Targeted Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an NCEH1&#8208;targeted covalent photoacoustic imaging probe activated under hypoxia. This probe potently and selectively labels NCEH1, an aggressive tumor associated serine hydrolase, in cells and is also activated under hypoxic conditions. Through covalent labeling and hypoxia activation, this probe offers selective and high&#8208;quality in vivo tumor imaging of aggressive prostate cancer.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality in biomedical imaging with superior imaging depth and specificity. However, PAI still has significant limitations, such as the background noise from endogenous chromophores. To overcome these limitations, we developed a covalent activity&#8208;based PAI probe, NOx&#8208;JS013, targeting NCEH1. NCEH1, a highly expressed and activated serine hydrolase in aggressive cancers, has the potential to be employed for the diagnosis of cancers. We show that NOx&#8208;JS013 labels active NCEH1 in live cells with high selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. NOx&#8208;JS013 also presents its efficacy as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive imaging probe in live cells. Finally, NOx&#8208;JS013 successfully visualizes aggressive prostate cancer tumors in mouse models of PC3, while being negligibly detected in tumors of non&#8208;aggressive LNCaP mouse models. These findings show that NOx&#8208;JS013 has the potential to be used to develop precision PAI reagents for detecting metastatic progression in various cancers.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosheet Induced Inverse Growth of Negative Valency Au Clusters for Tumor Treatment by Enhanced Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au clusters with negative valence supported by sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm POM&#8208;LDH facilitate the hole&#8208;electron separation in POMs and enhance the ROS generation under US, the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for GSH depletion, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger CDT simultaneously. The serious imbalance of redox in the TME leads to death of tumor ultimately.







Abstract
Cluster aggregation states are thermodynamically favored at the subnanoscale, for which an inverse growth from nanoparticles to clusters may be realized on subnanometer supports. Herein, we develop Au&#8208;polyoxometalate&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Au&#8208;POM&#8208;LDH) sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets (Sub&#8208;APL) based on the above strategy, where sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au clusters with negative valence are generated by the in situ disintegration of Au nanoparticles on POM&#8208;LDH supports. Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for glutathione (GSH) depletion. The closely connected sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Au with negative valence and POM hetero&#8208;units can promote the separation of hole&#8208;electrons, resulting in the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound (US). Besides, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger chemodynamic therapy (CDT) simultaneously, further enhancing the oxidative stress. Consequently, the Sub&#8208;APL present 2&#8208;fold ROS generation under US and 7&#8208;fold GSH depletion compared to the discrete Au and POM&#8208;LDH mixture. Therefore, the serious imbalance of redox in the TME caused by the sharp increase of ROS and rapid decrease of GSH leads to death of tumor ultimately.

         <title>Topology Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Interlaced Unsaturated 2D and Saturated 3D Units for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topology control strategy is reported to modulate the electron states of metal&#8208;free COF catalysts via interlacing unsaturated 2D and saturated 3D units. The 2D/3D framework interlaced COFs with locally irregular dimensions and typical D&#8211;A properties show high 2e&#8722; electrocatalytic activity, with the central carbon atoms of tetraphenyl&#8208;based units as active sites.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic state of multicomponent covalent organic framework (COF) electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. However, the effect of dimensionality on their physicochemical functionalities is still lacking. Herein, we report an interlaced unsaturated 2D and saturated 3D strategy to develop multicomponent&#8208;regulated COFs with tunable gradient dimensionality for high selectivity and activity electrocatalysis. Compared with the two&#8208;component 2D and 3D model COFs, the 2D/3D framework interlaced COFs with locally irregular dimensions and electronic structures are more practical in optimizing the intrinsic electrode surface reaction and mass transfer. Remarkably, the unsaturated 2D&#8208;inserted 3D TAE&#8208;COF regulates the adsorption mode of OOH* species to supply a favorable dynamic pathway for the H2O2 process, thereby achieving an excellent production rate of 8.50&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Moreover, utilizing theoretical calculation and in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR experiment, we found that the central carbon atom of the tetraphenyl&#8208;based unit (site&#8208;1 and site&#8208;6) are potential active sites. This strategy of operating the adsorption ability of reactants with dimensionality&#8208;interconnected building blocks provides an idea for designing durable and efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Synergizing Steric Hindrance and Stacking Interactions To Facilitate the Controlled Assembly of Multiple 41 Metalla&#8208;Knots and Pseudo&#8208;Solomon Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy has been used for controllable assembly. This has afforded a variety of structures ranging from 41 metalla&#8208;knots to a pseudo&#8208;Solomon link and a molecular tweezer&#8208;like assembly, co&#8208;driven by stacking interactions and repulsive interactions.







Abstract
In this work, a noncoplanar terphenyl served as a building block to synthesize a novel 3,3&#8242;&#8208;substituted bipyridyl ligand (L1) which further reacted with binuclear half&#8208;sandwich units A/B, giving rise to two aesthetic 41 metalla&#8208;knots in high yields via a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, given the inherent compactness of the 41 metalla&#8208;knots, it creates favorable conditions for the emergence of steric repulsion. We focused on progressively introducing nitrogen atoms featuring a lone pair of electrons (LPEs) into ligand L1 to manipulate the balance of H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/LPEs&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;LPEs steric repulsion during the assembly process, ultimately achieving controlled assembly from 41 metalla&#8208;knots to the pseudo&#8208;Solomon link and then to molecular tweezer&#8208;like assembly facilitated by stacking interactions. All the assemblies were well characterized by solution&#8208;state NMR techniques, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The evolutionary process of the topological architectures is equivalent to visualizing the synergistic effect of steric hindrance and stacking interactions on structural assembly, providing a new avenue for achieving the controlled synthesis of different topologies.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, a noncoplanar terphenyl served as a building block to synthesize a novel 3,3&#8242;-substituted bipyridyl ligand (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;) which further reacted with binuclear half-sandwich units &lt;b&gt;A/B&lt;/b&gt;, giving rise to two aesthetic 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; metalla-knots in high yields via a coordination-driven self-assembly strategy. Furthermore, given the inherent compactness of the 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; metalla-knots, it creates favorable conditions for the emergence of steric repulsion. We focused on progressively introducing nitrogen atoms featuring a lone pair of electrons (LPEs) into ligand &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; to manipulate the balance of H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/LPEs&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;LPEs steric repulsion during the assembly process, ultimately achieving controlled assembly from 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; metalla-knots to the &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-Solomon link and then to molecular tweezer-like assembly facilitated by stacking interactions. All the assemblies were well characterized by solution-state NMR techniques, ESI-TOF/MS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The evolutionary process of the topological architectures is equivalent to visualizing the synergistic effect of steric hindrance and stacking interactions on structural assembly, providing a new avenue for achieving the controlled synthesis of different topologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom 3d Transition Metals on SnO2 as Model Cell for Conversion Mechanism: Revealing Thermodynamic Catalytic Effects on Enhanced Na Storage of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of model cells has been established for conversion reactions between Na and TMSA&#8722;SnO2, where TMSA&#8722;SnO2 represents eight different 3d transition elements (V to Zn) single atom into SnO2. A thermodynamic catalytic effect has been identified for the first time, significantly promoting conversion reactions and enhancing performance.







Abstract
Since the discovery in 2000, conversion&#8208;type materials have emerged as a promising negative&#8208;electrode candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries with high capacity and tunable voltage, limited by low reversibility and severe voltage hysteresis. Heterogeneous construction stands out as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient approach to reducing reaction barriers and enhancing energy density. However, the second term introduced by conventional heterostructure inevitably complicates the electrochemical analysis and poses great challenges to harvesting systematic insights and theoretical guidance. A model cell is designed and established herein for the conversion reactions between Na and TMSA&#8722;SnO2, where TMSA&#8722;SnO2 represents single atom modification of eight different 3d transition elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn). Such a model unit fundamentally eliminates the interference from the second phase and thus enables independent exploration of activation manifestations of the heterogeneous architecture. For the first time, a thermodynamically dependent catalytic effect is proposed and verified through statistical data analysis. The mechanism behind the unveiled catalytic effect is further elucidated by which the active d orbitals of transition metals weaken the surface covalent bonds and lower the reaction barriers. This research provides both theoretical insights and practical demonstrations of the advanced heterogeneous electrodes.

The first nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylic amination of methanol&#8208;activated allenols enables a diverse array of functionalized allenylic amines to be accessed in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of amines in drug compounds, bioactive molecules and natural products has fueled intense interest in their synthesis. Herein, we introduce a nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylic amination of methanol&#8208;activated allenols. This protocol affords a diverse array of functionalized allenylic amines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by employing bioactive amines as nucleophiles and conducting gram&#8208;scale reactions. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations elucidate the role of methanol as an activator in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, facilitating the oxidative addition of the C&#8722;O bond of allenols through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The remarkable outcomes arise from a rapid racemization of allenols enabled by the nickel catalyst and from highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of &#951;3&#8208;alkadienylnickel intermediates.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Human Ferritin: Enhanced Drug Delivery of Aurothiomalate in A2780 Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurothiomalate (AuTM), a potential anticancer drug, is here conjugated to human H ferritin (HuHf), which specifically targets tumor cells via binding transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). The formation of a highly reproducible HuHf@AuTM bioconjugate is verified by ESI MS and other biophysical and computational methods. NMR metabolomics and antiproliferative tests point out that HuHf@AuTM is far more active than free AuTM.







Abstract
Aurothiomalate (AuTM) is an FDA&#8208;approved antiarthritic gold drug with unique anticancer properties. To enhance its anticancer activity, we prepared a bioconjugate with human apoferritin (HuHf) by attaching some AuTM moieties to surface protein residues. The reaction of apoferritin with excess AuTM yielded a single adduct, that was characterized by ESI MS and ICP&#8208;OES analysis, using three mutant ferritins and trypsinization experiments. The adduct contains ~3&#8197;gold atoms per ferritin subunit, arranged in a small cluster bound to Cys90 and Cys102. MD simulations provided a plausible structural model for the cluster. The adduct was evaluated for its pharmacological properties and was found to be significantly more cytotoxic than free AuTM against A2780 cancer cells mainly due to higher gold uptake. NMR&#8208;metabolomics showed that AuTM bound to HuHf and free AuTM induced qualitatively similar changes in treated cancer cells, indicating that the effects on cell metabolism are approximately the same, in agreement with independent biochemical experiments. In conclusion, we have demonstrated here that a molecularly precise bioconjugate formed between AuTM and HuHf exhibits anticancer properties far superior to the free drug, while retaining its key mechanistic features. Evidence is provided that human ferritin can serve as an excellent carrier for this metallodrug.

         <title>Anchoring Cs+ Ions on Carbon Vacancies for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO at High Current Densities in Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative implementation of anchored Cs+ in membrane electrode assembly electrolyzers significantly enhances CO2 electrolysis by facilitating CO2&#8722; intermediates formation and reducing *OH adsorption via induced electric field. This approach achieves an impressive CO Faradaic efficiency of 83.2&#8201;% at 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrolyte cations have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the rate and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet their implementation in electrolyte&#8208;free membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer presents significant challenges. Herein, an anchored cation strategy that immobilizes Cs+ on carbon vacancies was designed and innovatively implemented in MEA electrolyzer, enabling highly efficient CO2 electroreduction over commercial silver catalyst. Our approach achieves a CO partial current density of approximately 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA electrolyzer, three&#8208;fold enhancement compared to pure Ag. In situ Raman and theoretical analyses, combined with machine learning potentials, reveal anchored Cs induces an electric field that significantly promotes the adsorption of *CO2&#8722; intermediates through performing muti&#8208;point energy calculations on each structure. Furthermore, reduced adsorption of *OH intermediates effectively hampers competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as clarified by disk electrode experiments and density functional theory studies. Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3&#8201;%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation&#8208;promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.

         <title>Harnessing Cooperative Multivalency in Thioguanine for Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)&#8208;Based Differentiation of Polyfunctional Analytes Differing by a Single Functional Group</title>

6&#8208;Thioguanine (TG), as a receptor capable of forming multidentate cooperative hydrogen bonding, enables the interaction with less&#8208;reactive functional groups and strengthens receptor&#8208;analyte complexation to achieve analyte&#8208;specific surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for accurate polyfunctional analog identification.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule receptors are increasingly employed to probe various functional groups for (bio)chemical analysis. However, differentiation of polyfunctional analogs sharing multiple functional groups remains challenging for conventional mono&#8208; and bidentate receptors because their insufficient number of binding sites limits interactions with the least reactive yet property&#8208;determining functional group. Herein, we introduce 6&#8208;thioguanine (TG) as a supramolecular receptor for unique tridentate receptor&#8208;analyte complexation, achieving &#8805;97&#8201;% identification accuracy among 16 polyfunctional analogs across three classes: glycerol derivatives, disubstituted propane, and vicinal diols. Crucially, we demonstrate distinct spectral changes induced by the tridentate interaction between TG's three anchoring points and all the analyte's functional groups, even the least reactive ones. Notably, hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) networks formed in the TG&#8208;analyte complexes demonstrate additive effects in binding strength originating from good bond linearity, cooperativity, and resonance, thus strengthening complexation events and amplifying the differences in spectral changes induced among analytes. It also enhances spectral consistency by selectively forming a sole configuration that is stronger than the respective analyte&#8208;analyte interaction. Finally, we achieve 95.4&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex identification of a mixture consisting of multiple polyfunctional analogs. We envisage that extension to other multidentate non&#8208;covalent interactions enables the development of interference&#8208;free small molecule&#8208;based sensors for various (bio)chemical analysis applications.

         <title>A Dual Cobalt&#8208;Photoredox Catalytic Approach for Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles with Aryl Amides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we showcase cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with aryl amides, achieving remarkable enantioinduction and exceptional regioselectivity. This dual catalytic strategy, which integrates photocatalyst and cobalt, represents a pioneering approach in asymmetric C&#8722;H bond functionalization. Through detailed experimental investigations and DFT calculations, we present a plausible mechanism to elucidate the reaction pathway.







Abstract
In this study, we unveil a novel method for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles under cobalt/photoredox catalysis. By strategically activating C&#8722;H bonds of amides and subsequent migratory insertion of &#960;&#8208;bonds present in indole as reactive partner, we achieve syn&#8208;selective tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;c]isoquinolin&#8208;5&#8208;one derivatives with excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. The developed method operates without a metal oxidant, relying solely on oxygen as the oxidant and employing an organic dye as a photocatalyst under irradiation. Control experiments and stoichiometric studies elucidate the reversible nature of the enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation step, albeit not being rate&#8208;determining. This study not only expands the horizon of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond functionalization, but also showcases the potential synergy between cobalt and photoredox catalysis in enabling asymmetric synthesis of complex molecules.

         <title>Multiplexed and Quantitative Imaging of Live&#8208;Cell Membrane Proteins by a Precise and Controllable DNA&#8208;Encoded Amplification Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The template adhesion reaction represents a simple and precisely controllable amplification approach, which enables to assemble amplifiable DNA sequences with affinity ligands for proportional amplification and sensitive visualization of multiple membrane protein targets with enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios while maintaining their original concentration ratios.







Abstract
Amplifying DNA conjugated affinity ligands can improve the sensitivity and multiplicity of cell imaging and play a crucial role in comprehensively deciphering cellular heterogeneity and dynamic changes during development and disease. However, the development of one&#8208;step, controllable, and quantitative DNA amplification methods for multiplexed imaging of live&#8208;cell membrane proteins is challenging. Here, we introduce the template adhesion reaction (TAR) method for assembling amplifiable DNA sequences with different affinity ligands, such as aptamers or antibodies, for amplified and multiplexed imaging of live&#8208;cell membrane proteins with high quantitative fidelity. The precisely controllable TAR enables proportional amplification of membrane protein targets with variable abundances by modulating the concentration ratios of hairpin templates and primers, thus allowing sensitive visualization of multiple membrane proteins with enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNRs) without disturbing their original ratios. Using TAR, we achieved signal&#8208;enhanced imaging of six proteins on the same live&#8208;cell within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. TAR represents an innovative and programmable molecular toolkit for multiplexed profiling of membrane proteins in live&#8208;cells.

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Variants Catalyze the Reduction of Dialkyl Ketones with High Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones containing two similar alkyl groups is challenging. Although human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction of achiral water and CO2 to form achiral carbonic acid, the active zinc site in hCAII catalyzes, through a zinc&#8208;hydride, highly enantioselective reductions of a wide range of dialkyl ketones. Variants of hCAII react with distinct selectivites.







Abstract
Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction between two achiral molecules&#8212;water and carbon dioxide&#8212;to yield the achiral product carbonic acid through a zinc hydroxide intermediate. We have previously shown that a zinc hydride, instead of a hydroxide, can be generated in this enzyme to create a catalyst for the reduction of aryl ketones. Dialkyl ketones are more challenging to reduce, and the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with two alkyl groups that are similar in size and electronic properties, is a particularly challenging transformation to achieve with high activity and selectivity. Here, we show that hCAII, as well as a double mutant of it, catalyzes the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with high yields and enantioselectivities, even when the two alkyl groups are similar in size. We also show that variants of hCAII catalyze the site&#8208;selective reduction of one ketone over the other in an unsymmetrical aliphatic diketone. Computational docking of a dialkyl ketone to variants of hCAII containing the zinc hydride provides insights into the origins of the reactivity of various substrates and the high enantioselectivity of the transformations and show how a confined environment can control the enantioselectivity of an abiological intermediate.

         <title>Hydrophobic Ion Barrier&#8208;Enabled Ultradurable Zn (002) Plane Orientation towards Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Less Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating in original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O full cells (N/P ratio: 2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 full electrode after 842&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far surpassing conventional counterpart with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass.







Abstract
Gradual disability of Zn anode and high negative/positive electrode (N/P) ratio usually depreciate calendar life and energy density of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, within original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes, a steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating to solve this issue. Guided by theoretical simulations, hydrophobic adiponitrile (ADN) is employed as a steric hindrance agent to ally with inert electric field shielding additive (Mn2+) for plane adsorption priority manipulation, thereby constructing the &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221;. This design robustly suppresses the (002) plane/dendrite growth, enabling ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating.

     alt="Hydrophobic Ion Barrier-Enabled Ultradurable Zn (002) Plane Orientation towards Long-Life Anode-Less Zn Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A steric hindrance/electric field shielding-driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane-exposed Zn stripping/plating in original Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free hydrated electrolytes. As-assembled anode-less Zn&#8214;VOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cells (N/P ratio: 2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; full electrode after 842&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, far surpassing conventional counterpart with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradual disability of Zn anode and high negative/positive electrode (N/P) ratio usually depreciate calendar life and energy density of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, within original Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free hydrated electrolytes, a steric hindrance/electric field shielding-driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane-exposed Zn stripping/plating to solve this issue. Guided by theoretical simulations, hydrophobic adiponitrile (ADN) is employed as a steric hindrance agent to ally with inert electric field shielding additive (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) for plane adsorption priority manipulation, thereby constructing the &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221;. This design robustly suppresses the (002) plane/dendrite growth, enabling ultradurable (002) plane-exposed dendrite-free Zn stripping/plating. Even being cycled in Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cell over 2150&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the efficacy remains well-kept. Additionally, Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cells can be also stably cycled over 918&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, verifying uncompromised Zn stripping/plating kinetics. As-assembled anode-less Zn&#8214;VOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cells with a low N/P ratio (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics with Exceptional Conductivity by Polymer&#8208;Dopant Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Impressive n&#8208;type thermoelectric performances with a conductivity of 326&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor as high as 114&#8197;&#956;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 were realized through the approach of polymer&#8208;dopant matching, which involved blending two n&#8208;type polymers, f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN, with a julolidine functionalized benzimidazoline n&#8208;dopant (JLBI) in addition to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TAM and N&#8208;DMBI dopants.







Abstract
Achieving high electrical conductivity (&#963;) and power factor (PF) simultaneously remains a significant challenge for n&#8208;type organic themoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OTEs performance through blending a fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and its selenophene&#8208;substituted analogue f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN with a julolidine&#8208;functionalized benzimidazoline n&#8208;dopant JLBI, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis when blended with commercially available n&#8208;dopants TAM and N&#8208;DMBI. The advantages of introducing a more lipophilic julolidine group into the dopant structure of JLBI are evidenced by the enhanced OTEs performance that JLBI&#8208;doped films show when compared to those doped with N&#8208;DMBI or TAM. In fact, thanks to the enhanced intermolecular interactions and the lower&#8208;lying LUMO level enabled by the increase of selenophene content in polymer backbone, JLBI&#8208;doped films of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN exhibit a unprecedent &#963; of 206&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a PF of 114&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Interestingly, &#963; can be further enhanced up to 326&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 by using TAM dopant as a consequence of its favorable diffusion behavior into densely packed crystalline domains. These values are the highest to date for solution&#8208;processed molecularly n&#8208;doped polymers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the polymer&#8208;dopant matching approach carried out in this work.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Bridged Cyclobutanes by Lewis Acid Catalyzed Formal Cycloadditions of Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates and Bicyclobutanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A divergent synthesis of two types of sulfur&#8208;containing bridged cyclobutanes, 2&#8208;thia&#8208;5&#8208;azabicyclo[5.1.1]nonenes and thia&#8208;norpinenes from identical bicyclobutanes (BCBs), respectively, through high&#8208;order(5+3) and hetero&#8208;(3+3) reactions, has been developed.







Abstract
Bridged cyclobutanes and sulfur heterocycles are currently under intense investigation as building blocks for pharmaceutical drug design. Two formal cycloaddition modes involving bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate derivatives were described to rapidly expand the chemical space of sulfur&#8208;containing bridged cyclobutanes. By using Ni(ClO4)2 as the catalyst, an uncommon higher&#8208;order (5+3) cycloaddition of BCBs with quinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate was achieved with broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric polar (5+3) cycloaddition of BCB with pyridazinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate was accomplished. In contrast, pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates undergo an Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+3) reaction with BCBs to generate thia&#8208;norpinene products, which represent the initial instance of synthesizing 2&#8208;thiabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (thia&#8208;BCHeps) from BCBs. Moreover, we have successfully used this (3+3) protocol to rapidly prepare thia&#8208;BCHeps&#8208;substituted analogues of the bioactive molecule Pitofenone. Density functional theory (DFT) computations imply that kinetic factors govern the (5+3) cycloaddition reaction between BCB and quinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate, whereas the (3+3) reaction involving pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates is under thermodynamic control.

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cascade synthetic strategy for preparing well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we constructed a Fe dual&#8208;atom catalyst bridged by two nitrogen atoms, which exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance. Theoretically, our strategy can be further extended to synthesizing DACs with various metal categories and coordination environments, facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different reaction applications.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings. Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well&#8208;defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe). The as&#8208;synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#8197;V), high kinetic current density (21.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M&#8208;N2&#8208;M DACs (M=Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.

We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-M DACs (M=Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd&#8208;CeOx Nanoparticles in Zeolite Nanosheets for Efficient CO2&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Storage and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the synthesis of bimetallic Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts on zeolite nanosheets, demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance in formic acid dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to formate. The outstanding catalytic performance is attributed to significantly enhanced thermal stability, metal utilization, and transport efficiency. These findings offer crucial insights for advancing safe, efficient, and sustainable hydrogen technology development.







Abstract
Formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to FA/formate represent promising methodologies for the efficient and clean storage and release of hydrogen, forming a CO2&#8208;neutral energy cycle. Here, we report the synthesis of highly dispersed and stable bimetallic Pd&#8208;based nanoparticles, immobilized on self&#8208;pillared silicalite&#8208;1 (SP&#8208;S&#8208;1) zeolite nanosheets using an incipient wetness co&#8208;impregnation technique. Owing to the highly accessible active sites, effective mass transfer, exceptional hydrophilicity, and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic species, the optimized PdCe0.2/SP&#8208;S&#8208;1 catalyst demonstrated unparalleled catalytic performance in both FA dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to formate. Remarkably, it achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 5974&#8197;molH2&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a formate production rate of 536&#8197;molformate&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing most previously reported heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interfacial effect between Pd and cerium oxide clusters substantially reduces the activation barriers for both reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic performance. Our research not only showcases a compelling application of zeolite nanosheet&#8208;supported bimetallic nanocatalysts in CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage and release but also contributes valuable insights towards the development of safe, efficient, and sustainable hydrogen technologies.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Ring Morphology of Ag7NCs and Light&#8208;Induced Reversible Interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs via Cu2+ ions&#8208;Mediated Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present investigation demonstrates the light&#8208;induced reversible interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. UV light triggers the transformation of FCC Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs, whereas visible light induces the reversible interconversion of Ag7NCs to Ag14NCs. This study also reveals the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique supramolecular assembly in metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress made on intercluster conversion in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) and their self&#8208;organization to develop microscopic molecular architecture with well&#8208;defined size and shape, achieving light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation and the development of micro&#8208;ring self&#8208;assembly in MNCs have, so far, remained elusive. The present investigation touches on these two long&#8208;standing quests by showcasing a new route, light&#8208;induced Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion (PARI) for the reversible transformation from Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. Our studies reveal that the lack of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the system results in the formation of Ag7NCs with metallic kernels having centrosymmetric crystal packing. The molecular self&#8208;organization of Ag7NCs through various non&#8208;covalent interactions such as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; leads to the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique molecular architecture in MNCs. The in situ generated AgNPs due to the acceleration of the reaction kinetics by Cu2+ ions facilitate the growth of Ag14NCs with FCC metallic kernel. These two structural units of AgNCs show light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation which is also associated with the reversible tuning of their spectroscopic and morphological signatures. This PARI&#8208;guided interconversion strategy put forward a most appropriate example of a structure&#8211;property relationship in MNCs.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Acidity Regulation Enhances Electrocatalytic Performances of Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2&#8208;x Lewis acid component has been employed as a supporter to couple with active metal Au nanoparticles to accelerate the diffusion and enrichment of OH&#8722; toward the anode surface, which ensures the much enhanced electrochemical activity (current density of 693&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (81&#8201;%) for lactic acid production, so as to accelerate the electrocatalytic oxidation of other alcohols.







Abstract
The local acidity at the anode surface during electrolysis is apparently stronger than that in bulk electrolyte due to the deprotonation from the reactant, which leads to the deteriorated electrocatalytic performances and product distributions. Here, an anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial acidity regulation strategy has been proposed to inhibit local acidification at the surface of anode and enhance the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of anodic reactions. As a proof of the concept, CeO2&#8208;x Lewis acid component has been employed as a supporter to load Au nanoparticles to accelerate the diffusion and enrichment of OH&#8722; toward the anode surface, so as to accelerate the electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation reaction. As the result, Au/CeO2&#8208;x exhibits much enhanced lactic acid selectivity of 81&#8201;% and electrochemical activity of 693&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 current density in glycerol oxidation reaction compared to pure Au. Mechanism investigation reveals that the introduced Lewis acid promotes the mass transport and concentration of OH&#8722; on the anode surface, thus promoting the generation of lactic acid through the simultaneous enhancements of Faradaic and non&#8208;Faradaic processes. Attractively, the proposed strategy can be used for the electro&#8208;oxidation performance enhancements of a variety of alcohols, which thereby provides a new perspective for efficient alcohol electro&#8208;oxidations and the corresponding electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Clustering&#8208;Resistant Cu Single Atoms on Porous Au Nanoparticles Supported by TiO2 for Sustainable Photoconversion of CO2 into CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short text for summary: This research ascertains the actual deactivation mechanism of CO intermediates induced Cu single atoms coalescence in CO2 photoreduction, and provides a reconstituted surface intermediates adsorption strategy to resist Cu single atoms aggregation by anchoring Cu single atoms into Au porous nanoparticles, thereby boosting the efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability of CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Photocatalysts based on single atoms (SAs) modification can lead to unprecedented reactivity with recent advances. However, the deactivation of SAs&#8208;modified photocatalysts remains a critical challenge in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this study, we unveil the detrimental effect of CO intermediates on Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;SAs) during photocatalytic CO2 reduction, leading to clustering and deactivation on TiO2. To address this, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;SAs anchored on Au porous nanoparticles (CuAu&#8208;SAPNPs&#8208;TiO2) via a vectored etching approach. This system not only enhances CH4 production with a rate of 748.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 93.1&#8201;% selectivity but also mitigates Cu&#8208;SAs clustering, maintaining stability over 7&#8197;days. This sustained high performance, despite the exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity in CH4 production, highlights the CuAu&#8208;SAPNPs&#8208;TiO2 overarching superior photocatalytic properties. Consequently, this work underscores the potential of tailored SAs&#8208;based systems for efficient and durable CO2 reduction by reshaping surface adsorption dynamics and optimizing the thermodynamic behavior of the SAs.

&lt;p&gt;Short text for summary: This research ascertains the actual deactivation mechanism of CO intermediates induced Cu single atoms coalescence in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, and provides a reconstituted surface intermediates adsorption strategy to resist Cu single atoms aggregation by anchoring Cu single atoms into Au porous nanoparticles, thereby boosting the efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysts based on single atoms (SAs) modification can lead to unprecedented reactivity with recent advances. However, the deactivation of SAs-modified photocatalysts remains a critical challenge in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. In this study, we unveil the detrimental effect of CO intermediates on Cu single atoms (Cu-SAs) during photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, leading to clustering and deactivation on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To address this, we developed a novel Cu-SAs anchored on Au porous nanoparticles (CuAu-SAPNPs-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) via a vectored etching approach. This system not only enhances CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production with a rate of 748.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 93.1&#8201;% selectivity but also mitigates Cu-SAs clustering, maintaining stability over 7&#8197;days. This sustained high performance, despite the exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production, highlights the CuAu-SAPNPs-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overarching superior photocatalytic properties. Consequently, this work underscores the potential of tailored SAs-based systems for efficient and durable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction by reshaping surface adsorption dynamics and optimizing the thermodynamic behavior of the SAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Elucidation of the Luminescence Quenching Mechanism in Highly Efficient Hg2+ and Sulfadiazine Sensing by Ln&#8208;MOF</title>

Luminescent Ln&#8208;MOF NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb demonstrated highly selective quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations. The sensing mechanism through Hg2+ chelation was proposed based on SCXRD analysis and the interaction with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a TD&#8208;DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF&#8208;analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states.







Abstract
Heavy metal ions and antibiotic contamination have become a major environmental concern worldwide. The development of efficient recognition strategies of these pollutants at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in aqueous solutions as well as the elucidation of the intrinsic sensing mechanism are challenging tasks. In this work, unique luminescent Ln&#8208;MOF materials (NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln) were assembled by rational ligand design. Among them, NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb demonstrated highly selective luminescence quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations in less than 7&#8197;s. In addition, a Hg2+ sensing mechanism through chelation was proposed on the basis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Hg2+ adsorption study. The interaction mechanism of NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a (TD&#8208;)DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF&#8208;analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states. Effect of ultrasonic treatment on the surface morphology important for MOF sensing performance was revealed by gas adsorption experiments. The presented results indicate that NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln is not only an advanced sensing material for the efficient detection of Hg2+ and SDI at ultra&#8208;low concentrations, but also opens up a new approach to study the sensing mechanism at the molecular level at ultra&#8208;low concentrations.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Rich Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce Sites in CeO2 Supported Patchy Atomic&#8208;Layer Pt Enable a Non&#8208;CO Pathway for Efficient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective coupling of *CHO and *OH is induced by forming abundant super adjacent *OH intermediates and maximizing edge Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce active sites, thereby facilitating a non&#8208;CO pathway. This approach effectively circumvents the generation of *CO intermediates.







Abstract
Rational design of efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst that undergo non&#8208;CO pathway is essential to resolve the long&#8208;standing poisoning issue. However, it remains a huge challenge due to the rather difficulty in maximizing the non&#8208;CO pathway by the selective coupling between the key *CHO and *OH intermediates. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst of patchy atomic&#8208;layer Pt epitaxial growth on CeO2 nanocube (Pt ALs/CeO2) with maximum electronic metal&#8208;support interaction for enhancing the coupling selectively. The small&#8208;size monolayer material achieves an optimal geometrical distance between edge Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce sites and *OH absorbed on CeO2, which well restrains the dehydrogenation of *CHO, resulting in the non&#8208;CO pathway. Meanwhile, the *CHO/*CO intermediate generated at inner Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce sites can migrate to edge, inducing the subsequent coupling reaction, thus avoiding poisoning while promoting reaction efficiency. Consequently, Pt ALs/CeO2 exhibits exceptionally catalytic stability with negligible degradation even under 1000&#8197;s pure CO poisoning operation and high mass activity (14.87&#8197;A/mgPt), enabling it one of the best&#8208;performing alkali&#8208;stable MOR catalysts.

         <title>Enabling Modular Click Chemistry Library through Sequential Ligations of Carboxylic Acids and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double click strategy that enables the sequential ligation of carboxylic acids and amines with FSO2NCO has been developed. This method provides facile access to modular click chemistry library under simple conditions in tubes or on 96&#8208;well microplates. Preliminary screening reveals that some compounds exhibit high antimicrobial activities against S. aureus and MRSA, highlighting the potency of this method in high&#8208;throughput medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput synthesis and screening of chemical libraries play pivotal roles in drug discovery. Click chemistry has emerged as a powerful strategy for constructing highly modular chemical libraries. However, the development of new click reactions and unlocking new clickable building blocks remain exceedingly challenging. Herein, we describe a double&#8208;click strategy that enables the sequential ligations of widely available carboxylic acids and amines with fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSO2NCO) via a modular amidation/SuFEx (sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange) process. This method provides facile access to chemical libraries of N&#8208;fluorosulfonyl amides (RCONHSO2F) and N&#8208;acylsulfamides (RCONHSO2NR&#8242;R&#8242;&#8242;) in near&#8208;quantitative yields under simple and practical conditions. The robustness and efficiency of this double click strategy is showcased by the facile construction of chemical libraries in 96&#8208;well microtiter plates from a large number of carboxylic acids and amines. Preliminary biological activity screening reveals that some compounds exhibit high antimicrobial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacterium S. aureus and drug&#8208;resistant MRSA (MIC up to 6.25&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mL&#8722;1). These results provide compelling evidence for the potential application of modular click chemistry library as an enabling technology in high&#8208;throughput medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of a Stable Prefunctionalized Silver Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable silver nanocluster [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOC6H4C&#8801;C)6]SbF6 can be facilely synthesized in gram scale in ~90&#8201;% yield. The aldehyde groups preorganized in this cluster are available for further functionalization. Chiral modification through aldimine condensation gives homochiral clusters. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOPhC&#8801;C)6]SbF6, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90&#8201;% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.

&lt;p&gt;The ultrastable silver nanocluster [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CHOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can be facilely synthesized in gram scale in ~90&#8201;% yield. The aldehyde groups preorganized in this cluster are available for further functionalization. Chiral modification through aldimine condensation gives homochiral clusters. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster-based materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CHOPhC&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90&#8201;% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one-pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A general structure descriptor &#963; is constructed to quantify the structure&#8211;activity relationship of axial&#8208;coordination&#8208;ligand single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACL&#8208;SACs), as reported by Dapeng Cao, Xiao Cheng Zeng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407812). The &#963; is solely based on a few key intrinsic features and can provide a simple and quick way to screen efficient electrocatalysts.

Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers rational control over molecular properties through the careful selection and combination of subcomponents. In a Research Article from the Stauber lab (e202408751), this approach optimizes the binding strength of hybrid molecular glycoassemblies with protein targets by adjusting carbohydrate linking units, assembly size, and molecular charge. Similar to selecting the perfect combination of ingredients in a kitchen, this method allows for the customization of biomolecular binding properties through choice of the right molecular building blocks.

An on&#8208;demand antigen supply system was realized to precisely control the flux of antigens. On a flash of light, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope was released from streptavidin. In their Research Article (e202405035), Robert Tamp&#233;, Ralph Wieneke et&#8197;al. utilized the photochemically induced &#8220;burst of antigens&#8221; to instantaneously initiate the translocation of peptides via ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters reconstituted in liposomes or microsomes of human origin.

         <title>In Situ Production of Hydroxyl Radicals via Three&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction: Opportunities for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the in situ production of the hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) via the novel three&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (3e&#8722; ORR) to provide insights for overcoming the bottlenecks of the traditional electro&#8208;Fenton process. The features and mechanisms of the 3e&#8722; ORR, including its basic principles and latest progress, are explored. Additionally, practical water&#8208;treatment applications, future developments, and challenges are discussed.







Abstract
The electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) process is an advanced oxidation technology with significant potential; however, it is limited by two steps: generation and activation of H2O2. In contrast to the production of H2O2 via the electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electrochemical three&#8208;electron (3e&#8722;) ORR can directly activate molecular oxygen to yield the hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH), thus breaking through the conceptual and operational limitations of the traditional EF reaction. Therefore, the 3e&#8722; ORR is a vital process for efficiently producing &#8901;OH in situ, thus charting a new path toward the development of green water&#8208;treatment technologies. This review summarizes the characteristics and mechanisms of the 3e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the basic principles and latest progress in the in situ generation and efficient utilization of &#8901;OH through the modulation of the reaction pathway, shedding light on the rational design of 3e&#8722; ORR catalysts, mechanistic exploration, and practical applications for water treatment. Finally, the future developments and challenges of efficient, stable, and large&#8208;scale utilization of &#8901;OH are discussed based on achieving optimal 3e&#8722; ORR regulation and the potential to combine it with other technologies.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Enabled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers Recyclability and Material Circularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>

Integrating covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) offers a new avenue for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs. This review highlights the recent developments, focusing on crosslinking polymers made from CANs, emphasizing applications in carbon fiber recycling and resin sustainability.







Abstract
Due to their remarkable features of lightweight, high strength, stiffness, high&#8208;temperature resistance, and corrosion resistance, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are extensively used in sports equipment, vehicles, aircraft, windmill blades, and other sectors. The urging need to develop a resource&#8208;saving and environmentally responsible society requires the recycling of CFRPs. Traditional CFRPs, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle due to the permanent covalent crosslinking of polymer matrices. The combination of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fibers (CFs) marks a new development path for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs and polymer resins. In this review, we summarize the most recent developments of closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs from the unique paradigm of dynamic crosslinking polymers, CANs. These sophisticated materials with diverse functions, oriented towards CFs recycling and resin sustainability, are further categorized into several active domains of dynamic covalent bonds, including ester bonds, imine bonds, disulfide bonds, boronic ester bonds, and acetal linkages, etc. Finally, the possible strategies for the future design of recyclable CFPRs by combining dynamic covalent chemistry innovation with materials interface science are proposed.

         <title>Challenges and Applications of Supramolecular Metalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular chemistry of metalate anions is relatively unexplored and far less understood compared with simple anions. This review discusses the latest advances in supramolecular metalate chemistry, highlighting its important role across a diverse range of applications including medical imaging, environmental remediation, perovskite materials, magnetism, catalysis, and metal separations.







Abstract
While the supramolecular chemistry of simple anions is ubiquitous, the targeting and exploitation of their metal&#8208;containing relatives, the metalates, is less well understood. This mini review highlights the latest advances in this emergent area by discussing the supramolecular chemistry of metalates thematically, with a focus on the exploitation of metalates in a diversity of applications, including medical imaging and therapy, environmental remediation, molecular magnetism, catalysis, perovskite materials, and metal separations. The unifying features of these systems are identified with a view to allow the supramolecular chemist to target the unique material properties of the metalates, even in areas that are currently relatively immature.

         <title>&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Selective Selenium&#8208;catalyzed Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Enol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium catalyst allows C&#8722;H amination of a wide range of potentially cross&#8208;reactive enol derivatives with unique selectivity for the &#945;&#8217;&#8208;position, thereby unlocking the reactive potential of both ketone &#945;&#8208;positions. Stereoconvergent formation of Z enol derivatives from E/Z mixtures eliminates the need for selective enolization methods. Resonance donation from the oxygen in the ene transition state is responsible for the high regioselectivity.







Abstract
A transition metal&#8208;free Se&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amination protocol for &#945;&#8217;&#8208;amination of enol derivatives has been developed. This reaction can be used to functionalize a wide variety of oxygen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted alkenes spanning a vast range of nucleophilicities, giving &#945;&#8217;&#8208;aminated enol derivatives with high regioselectivity. Amination of E/Z mixtures of alkenes proceeds stereoconvergently to give the (Z)&#8208;enol derivatives exclusively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the relative reactivity and &#945;&#8217;&#8208;regioselectivity of these transformations is determined by substantial resonance donation to the heteroatom&#8208;bound carbon in the transition state. These products participate in traditional reactions of enol derivatives, allowing for efficient functionalization of both &#945;&#8208; and &#945;&#8217;&#8208;positions from a single enol derivative with high diastereocontrol.

         <title>Synthesis and Comprehensive Studies of Be&#8208;IV&#8208;N2 (IV=Si, Ge): Solving the Mystery of Wurtzite&#8208;Type Pmc21 Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
BeSiN2 was synthesized in a radio&#8208;frequency furnace, forming a structure typical for wurtzite&#8208;type nitride materials. The behavior under high&#8208;pressure conditions was elucidated in a diamond anvil cell. Reacting Be3N2 with Ge3N4 in a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature approach gains access to a new substance class and to the unique structure of BeGeN2, which differs from that of the Si analog. Both materials show a second harmonic generation effect.







Abstract
The research for wurtzite&#8208;type ternary nitride semiconductors containing earth abundant elements with a stoichiometry of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;2 was focused on metals like Mg or Zn, so far. The vast majority of these Grimm&#8211;Sommerfeld analogue compounds crystallize in the &#946;&#8208;NaFeO2 structure, although a second arrangement in space group Pmc21 is predicted to be a viable alternative. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies, this structure has so far remained undiscovered. Herein, we report on BeGeN2 in a Pmc21 structure, synthesized from Be3N2 and Ge3N4 using a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 6&#8197;GPa and 800&#8201;&#176;C. The compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;dependent PXRD, second harmonic generation (SHG) and UV/Vis measurements and in addition also compared to its lighter homologue BeSiN2 in all mentioned analytic techniques. The synthesis and investigation of both the first beryllium germanium nitride and the first ternary wurtzite&#8208;type nitride crystallizing in space group Pmc21 open the door to a new field of research on wurtzite&#8208;type related structures.

&lt;p&gt;BeSiN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was synthesized in a radio-frequency furnace, forming a structure typical for wurtzite-type nitride materials. The behavior under high-pressure conditions was elucidated in a diamond anvil cell. Reacting Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Ge&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a high-pressure, high-temperature approach gains access to a new substance class and to the unique structure of BeGeN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which differs from that of the Si analog. Both materials show a second harmonic generation effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research for wurtzite-type ternary nitride semiconductors containing earth abundant elements with a stoichiometry of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;2 was focused on metals like Mg or Zn, so far. The vast majority of these Grimm&#8211;Sommerfeld analogue compounds crystallize in the &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-NaFeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure, although a second arrangement in space group &lt;i&gt;Pmc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is predicted to be a viable alternative. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies, this structure has so far remained undiscovered. Herein, we report on BeGeN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a &lt;i&gt;Pmc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structure, synthesized from Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ge&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; using a high-pressure high-temperature approach at 6&#8197;GPa and 800&#8201;&#176;C. The compound was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, temperature-dependent PXRD, second harmonic generation (SHG) and UV/Vis measurements and in addition also compared to its lighter homologue BeSiN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in all mentioned analytic techniques. The synthesis and investigation of both the first beryllium germanium nitride and the first ternary wurtzite-type nitride crystallizing in space group &lt;i&gt;Pmc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; open the door to a new field of research on wurtzite-type related structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Quasi&#8208;1D chain antiferromagnets are considered a rich playground for investigating complex magnetic properties. We reported the synthesis, crystal structures, and magnetism of two novel copper&#8208;based 1D chain tellurates &#946;&#8208;PbCu2(TeO3)2Cl2 and PbCu2(TeO3)2Br2. The short&#8208; and long&#8208;range magnetic ordering is stabilized through the cooperative effect of 1D [CuO4]&#8734; Chains and [CuO2X2] quadrilateral in this quasi&#8208;1D spin&#8208;1/2 System.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;1D chain antiferromagnets with reduced structural dimensionality are a rich playground for investigating novel quantum phenomena. We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetism of two novel quasi&#8208;1D antiferromagnets, &#946;&#8208;PbCu2(TeO3)2Cl2 (I) and PbCu2(TeO3)2Br2 (II). Their magnetic frameworks are constructed via Cu&#8208;based quasi&#8208;1D [Cu(2)O4]&#8734; zigzag chains with square&#8208;planar [Cu(1)O2X2] (X=Cl or Br) separated among 1D chains. Specific heat measurements show &#955; peaks at ~9&#8197;K and ~19&#8197;K for I and II, respectively. Moreover, both broad maximums (&#967;max=90&#8197;K for I and 80&#8197;K for II) and small kinks (TN&#8776;9&#8197;K for I and 19&#8197;K for II) have been observed in magnetic susceptibility measurements of I and II. Bonner&#8211;Fisher model fitting, and theoretical analyses were performed to evaluate the magnetic exchange interactions. Our experimental and theoretical results and structure&#8208;properties relationship analysis reveal the coexistence of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range magnetic ordering from the cooperative effect of 1D [CuO4]&#8734; chains and [CuO2X2] quadrilateral.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Layered Membranes with Precisely Controlled Nano&#8208;Confined Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superspreading shear&#8208;flow induces alignment of nanosheets, followed by rapid cross&#8208;linking of nanosheets with metal ions to form precisely controlled nano&#8208;confined channels. Due to the cross&#8208;linking between the metal ions and the nanosheets, the nano&#8208;confined channels exhibit excellent stability in different solutions and ionic sieving performance.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets&#8208;based membranes, which have controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels, are highly desirable for molecular/ionic sieving and confined reactions. However, it is still difficult to develop an efficient method to prepare large&#8208;area membranes with high stability, high orientation, and accurately adjustable interlayer spacing. Here, we present a strategy to produce metal ion cross&#8208;linked membranes with precisely controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels and high stability in different solutions using superspreading shear&#8208;flow&#8208;induced assembly strategy. For example, membranes based on graphene oxide (GO) exhibit interlayer spacing ranging from 8.0&#177;0.1&#8197;&#197; to 10.3&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197;, with a precision of down to 1&#8197;&#197;. At the same time, the value of the orientation order parameter (f) of GO membranes is up to 0.95 and GO membranes exhibit superb stability in different solutions. The strategy we present, which can be generalized to the preparation of 2D nano&#8208;confined channels based on a variety of 2D materials, will expand the application scope and provide better performances of membranes.

         <title>2,2&#8208;Difluoroethylation of Heteroatom Nucleophiles via a Hypervalent Iodine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hypervalent iodine(III) reagent is disclosed for 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation of thiols, amines and alcohols via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. A range of pharmaceutically relevant nucleophiles are difluoroethylated, including morpholine, glucose and the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.







Abstract
The 2,2&#8208;difluoroethyl group is an important lipophilic hydrogen bond donor in medicinal chemistry, but its incorporation into small molecules is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate electrophilic 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation of thiol, amine and alcohol nucleophiles with a hypervalent iodine reagent, (2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;ethyl)(aryl)iodonium triflate, via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. This transformation offers a complementary strategy to existing 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation methods and allows access to a wide range of 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylated nucleophiles, including the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.

         <title>Capturing the Interplay Between TADF and RTP Through Mechanically Flexible Polymorphic Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic crystals offer pioneering options to explore diverse photophysical phenomena through clever crystal engineering principles. Here we demonstrate capturing the interplay between TADF and RTP through mechanically flexible polymorphic optical waveguides with the help of AFM&#8208;tip&#8208;based mechanophotonics technique.







Abstract
Polymorphism plays a pivotal role in generating a range of crystalline materials with diverse photophysical and mechanical attributes, all originating from the same molecule. Here, we showcase two distinct polymorphs: green (GY) emissive and orange (OR) emissive crystals of 5&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TPA&#8208;CHO). These polymorphs display differing optical characteristics, with GY exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and OR showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Additionally, both polymorphic crystals display mechanical flexibility and optical waveguiding capabilities. Leveraging the AFM&#8208;tip&#8208;based mechanophotonics technique, we position the GY optical waveguide at varying lengths perpendicular to the OR waveguide. This approach facilitates the exploration of the interplay between TADF and RTP phenomena by judiciously controlling the optical path length of crystal waveguides. Essentially, our approach provides a clear pathway for understanding and controlling the photophysical processes in organic molecular crystals, paving the way for advancements in polymorphic crystal&#8208;based photonic circuit technologies.

     alt="Capturing the Interplay Between TADF and RTP Through Mechanically Flexible Polymorphic Optical Waveguides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible organic crystals offer pioneering options to explore diverse photophysical phenomena through clever crystal engineering principles. Here we demonstrate capturing the interplay between TADF and RTP through mechanically flexible polymorphic optical waveguides with the help of AFM-tip-based mechanophotonics technique.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism plays a pivotal role in generating a range of crystalline materials with diverse photophysical and mechanical attributes, all originating from the same molecule. Here, we showcase two distinct polymorphs: green (GY) emissive and orange (OR) emissive crystals of 5&#8242;-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-[2,2&#8242;-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde (TPA-CHO). These polymorphs display differing optical characteristics, with GY exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and OR showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Additionally, both polymorphic crystals display mechanical flexibility and optical waveguiding capabilities. Leveraging the AFM-tip-based mechanophotonics technique, we position the GY optical waveguide at varying lengths perpendicular to the OR waveguide. This approach facilitates the exploration of the interplay between TADF and RTP phenomena by judiciously controlling the optical path length of crystal waveguides. Essentially, our approach provides a clear pathway for understanding and controlling the photophysical processes in organic molecular crystals, paving the way for advancements in polymorphic crystal-based photonic circuit technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in O&#8208;Nitration: Selective Alcohol Nitration Deploying N,6&#8208;Dinitrosaccharin and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel catalytic approach for the mild and selective synthesis of nitrate esters by direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols and diols. Using stable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin and magnesium triflate, this method tolerates a broad diversity of functional groups and is amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization. DFT studies reveal a dual role of magnesium catalyst. This innovative method advances the synthesis of versatile nitrates for drug discovery.







Abstract
Nitrate esters hold pivotal roles in pharmaceuticals, energetic materials, and atmospheric processes, motivating the development of efficient synthesis routes. Here, we present a novel catalytic method for the synthesis of nitrates via the direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, addressing limitations of current traditional methods. Leveraging bench&#8208;stable and recoverable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin reagent, our catalytic strategy employs magnesium triflate to achieve mild and selective O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, offering broad substrate scope and unprecedentedly large functional group tolerance (e.g. alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls). DFT mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the magnesium catalyst in the activation of both the nitrating reagent and the alcohol substrate. They also unveil a barrierless proton transfer upon formation of a widely&#8208;accepted &#8211; yet elusive in solution &#8211; nitrooxonium ion intermediate. Overall, our work contributes to the development of mild, selective, and sustainable approaches to nitrates synthesis, with potential applications in drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry.

         <title>Design of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials: Transition from Carbonyl to Amide&#8208;Based Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transitioning from a carbonyl (O=C) to an amide (O=C&#8722;N) skeleton as the acceptor significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline&#8208;based TADF materials function as efficient emitters for constructing non&#8208;doped OLEDs and serve as hosts for assembling narrowband red fluorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
Benzophenone skeletons containing a carbonyl unit (O=C) have been widely used as electron acceptors in the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Herein, we present a novel molecular design concept for TADF materials by transitioning from a carbonyl to an amide (O=C&#8722;N) skeleton as the acceptor. The amide unit, compared to its carbonyl counterpart, offers a more stable electronic configuration. Leveraging this insight, we have developed a series of high&#8208;performance TADF molecules based on benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline acceptors. These molecules exhibit exceptionally small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and pronounced aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields in neat films as high as 99&#8201;%. Consequently, these materials serve as efficient emitters in non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;eimtting diodes (OLEDs), reaching a maximum quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of up to 26.0&#8201;%, significantly higher than the 17.0&#8201;% obtained with benzophenone acceptor&#8208;based TADF molecules. Additionally, they have been used as TADF hosts in narrowband red fluorescent OLEDs, setting a record&#8208;high EQEmax of 22.4&#8201;%.

         <title>Spontaneous Transition between Multiple Conductance States and Rectifying Behaviors in an Artificial Single&#8208;Molecule Funnel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel was constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. This molecular funnel exhibited multiple conducting states and spontaneous transitions between them, as well chloride&#8208;selective transport ability and voltage&#8208;dependent gating property (rectification) due to the asymmetrical channel structure.







Abstract
It has long been an aspirational goal to create artificial channel structures that replicate the feat achieved by ion channel proteins. Biological ion channels occasionally demonstrate multiple conductance states (known as subconductance), remaining a challenging property to achieve in artificial channel molecules. We report a funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. Planar lipid bilayer measurements reveal distinct current recordings, including a closed state, two conducting states, and spontaneous transitions between the three states, resembling the events seen in biological ion channels. The transitions result from conformational changes induced by chloride transport in the channel molecule. Both opening states show a non&#8208;linear and rectifying I&#8211;V relationship, indicating voltage&#8208;dependent transport due to the asymmetrical channel structure. This work could enhance our understanding of ion permeation and channel opening mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles through Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization Enabled by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient protocol for chiral dihydroisoquinolone&#8208;fused indolines through a cobaltaphotoredox catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/dearomatization of indoles. Mechanistic studies indicate the excited photocatalyst was quenched by cobalt(II) species in the presence of Salox ligand. The stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate suggest the irradiation of light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.







Abstract
Photocatalysis holds a pivotal position in modern organic synthesis, capable of inducing novel reactivities under mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. However, the merger of photocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation as an efficient and sustainable method for the construction of chiral molecules remains elusive and challenging. Herein, we develop a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation reaction enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, providing a synergistic catalytic strategy for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with high levels of enantioselectivity (96&#8201;% to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies indicate that the excited photocatalyst was quenched by divalent cobalt species in the presence of Salox ligand, leading to the formation of catalytically active chiral Co(III) complex. Moreover, stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate with indole suggest that the irradiation of visible light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.

         <title>A General Descriptor for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Axial Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 40, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general descriptor &#963; was constructed to predict the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activity of axial coordination ligand single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACL&#8208;SACs). We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8722;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Importantly, an axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL was also identified that can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment.







Abstract
Decoration of an axial coordination ligand (ACL) on the active metal site is a highly effective and versatile strategy to tune activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the regulation mechanism of ACLs on SACs is still incompletely known. Herein, we investigate diversified combinations of ACL&#8208;SACs, including all 3d&#8211;5d transition metals and ten prototype ACLs. We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8722;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Through examination of various local configurations and intrinsic parameters of ACL&#8208;SACs, a general structure descriptor &#963; is constructed to quantify the structure&#8211;activity relationship of ACL&#8208;SACs which solely based on a few key intrinsic features. Importantly, we also identified the axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL, as a part of &#963;, which can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps (RLS) of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment. And we predicted several ACL&#8208;SACs, namely, CrN4&#8208;, FeN4&#8208;, CoN4&#8208;, RuN4&#8208;, RhN4&#8208;, OsN4&#8208;, IrN4&#8208; and PtN4&#8208;ACLs, that entail markedly higher activities than the benchmark catalysts of Pt and IrO2 for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, thereby supporting that the general descriptor &#963; can provide a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to assess efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization of Simple Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) system is reported that facilitates the direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to give substituted phenols. The process entails successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and leverages molecular oxygen from the air to drive the reaction cycle. This approach serves as a robust alternative to conventional synthetic methods.







Abstract
Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Axial Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection by a Two&#8208;Dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection was achieved by using the multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric material BA2EA2Pb3I10 for the first time. It presents ultra&#8208;low detection limits along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis (19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) at zero bias, which was two orders of magnitude lower than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. However, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23&#8197;V and 0.22&#8197;V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.

         <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission&#8208;Dominated Design Strategy for Constructing Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots With Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated strategy was proposed, achieving desired Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, crosslinking, conjugation and steric hindrance factors were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission.







Abstract
Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emissions to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e., crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8722;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs but also helps understand the origin of NIR RTP to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

         <title>Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoester and 1,3&#8208;Diol to Access Chemically Recyclable and Mechanically Robust Poly(vinyl alcohol) Thermosets through Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester</title>

TOC: &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high&#8208;performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, followed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction with 1,3&#8208;diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross&#8208;linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.







Abstract
The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with &#946;&#8208;ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross&#8208;linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. The cross&#8208;linking architecture improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, i.e. approximately 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&gt;90&#8201;%) of PVA. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.

The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conductance increases with length at a significant rate in a series of bis(indeno)acene molecular wires. The rapid shrinking of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap induced by the singlet diradicaloid character of these compounds is responsible for the observed behaviour. These results pave the way to long&#8208;range, efficient coherent tunnelling charge transport.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states&#8212;especially in contact with metallic electrodes&#8212;is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window (

&#177;1.3V

 ${\pm 1.3\ V}$



). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.

         <title>Standardized Parts for Activation of Small GTPase Signaling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a plug and play approach for the direct control of small GTPase activation in living cells. This approach is applied to the temporal control of filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, cell retraction, and MAPK signaling.







Abstract
Small GTPases comprise a superfamily of over 167 proteins in the human genome and are critical regulators of a variety of pathways including cell migration and proliferation. Despite the importance of these proteins in cell signaling, a standardized approach for controlling small GTPase activation within living cells is lacking. Herein, we report a split&#8208;protein&#8208;based approach to directly activate small GTPase signaling in living cells. Importantly, our fragmentation site can be applied across the small GTPase superfamily. We highlight the utility of these standardized parts by demonstrating the ability to directly modulate the activity of four different small GTPases with user&#8208;defined inputs, providing the first plug and play system for direct activation of small GTPases in living cells.

         <title>MOFite: A High&#8208;Density Lithiophilic and Scalable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Anode for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A salicylaldehydate&#8208;linked iron&#8208;based MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) was demonstrated as a scalable and high&#8208;performance pristine anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Furthermore, Fe&#8722;Tp has been explored as a performance enhancer for commercial graphite anodes in LIBs, highlighting its potential practical utility.







Abstract
Developing an anode material that has better performance efficiency than commercial graphite while keeping the features of economic scalability and environmental safety is highly desirable yet challenging. MOFs are a promising addition to the ongoing efforts, however, the relatively poor performance, chemical instability, and large&#8208;scale economic production of efficiency&#8208;proven pristine MOFs restrict their utility in real&#8208;life energy storage applications. Furthermore, hierarchical porosity for lucid mass diffusion, high&#8208;density lithiophilic sites are some of the structural parameters for improving the electrode performance. Herein, we have demonstrated the potential of economically scalable salicylaldehydate 3D&#8208;conjugated&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) as a high&#8208;performance anode in Li&#8208;ion batteries: the anode&#8208;specific capacity achieved up to 1447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 89&#8201;% of cyclic stability after 500&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for pristine MOF. More importantly, incorporating 10&#8201;% Fe&#8722;Tp doping in commercial graphite (MOFite) significantly enhanced lithium storage, doubling capacity after 400&#8197;cycles. It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8722;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural systems optimize charge carrier behavior via molecular spatial arrangement, a phenomenon largely unexplored in artificial systems. PFC&#8208;1, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with controllable &#960;&#8208;stacking, offers valuable insights into this process. Varying &#960;&#8208;stacking perpendicular to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in HOFs alters electron density, redox potential, and charge carrier transport and separation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance.







Abstract
Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.

         <title>Porous Organic Cage as an Efficient Platform for Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cage (POC) was firstly developed as an efficient platform for industrial radioactive iodine capture, which provides a new insight for sufficiently utilizing binding sites. The constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, extraordinary adsorption capacity of unitionic sites (1.62 I2/ionic sites), and remarkable kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1).







Abstract
Herein, we firstly develop porous organic cage (POC) as an efficient platform for highly effective radioactive iodine capture under industrial operating conditions (typically &#8805;150&#8201;&#176;C), &#8804;150&#8197;ppmv of I2). Due to the highly dispersed and readily accessible binding sites as well as sufficient accommodating space, the constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;) (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake capacity of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;% and extraordinary adsorption capacity of unit ionic site (~1.62) at 150&#8201;&#176;C and 150&#8197;ppmv of I2. The I2 capacity is 3.5, 1.6, and 1.3&#8197;times higher than industrial silver&#8208;based adsorbents Ag@MOR and benchmark materials of TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the same conditions. Furthermore, NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me exhibits remarkable adsorption kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1), which is 1.2 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the identical conditions. NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me thus sets a new benchmark for industrial radioactive I2 adsorbents. This work not only provides a new insight for effectively enhancing the adsorption capacity of unit functional sites, but also advances POC as an efficient platform for radioiodine capture in industry.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;free aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries were designed via matching Mn2+/MnO2 and S/Cu2S redox couplings, which exhibit high energy density and excellent cycling stability. These merits endow them with significant potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
The energy densities of conventional aqueous batteries are often unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of electrode materials. Therefore, the design of creative aqueous batteries has to be considered. Herein, aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries are constructed by matching S/Cu2S redox couples and MnO2 deposition/dissolution. In such batteries, S/Cu2S redox couples undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction with four&#8208;electron transfer, ensuring a high specific capacity of 2220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in S anodes. Furthermore, the conversion reaction of S/Cu2S redox couples can take place stably in acidic electrolyte that is essential for the MnO2 deposition/dissolution. As a result, the S/Cu2S redox couples can match MnO2 deposition/dissolution well, which endow the batteries with a membrane&#8208;free configuration. As a proof of concept, Ah&#8208;level prismatic and single&#8208;flow batteries were assembled and could operate stably for over 1000&#8197;h, demonstrating their great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. This work broadens the horizons of aqueous batteries beyond metal&#8208;manganese chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Reliable Operation of All&#8208;Climate 4.8&#8197;V Li||NCM811 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A superior oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte is designed to conquer the high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich lithium metal batteries. Our electrolyte demonstrates superb compatibility with both lithium metal anode and NCM811 cathode at even 4.8&#8197;V. We validate a 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li||NCM811 pouch cell with energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pioneeringly, highlighting the practical potential of our electrolyte.







Abstract
Combining high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes with lithium metal anodes is among the most promising approaches for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. However, most current electrolytes fail to simultaneously satisfy the compatibility requirements for the lithium metal anode and the tolerance for the ultra&#8208;high voltage NCM811 cathode. Here, we have designed an ultra&#8208;oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte by meticulously adjusting the composition of fluorinated carbonates. Our study reveals that a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in LiF and Li2O is constructed on the lithium anode through the synergistic decomposition of the fluorinated solvents and PF6&#8722; anion, facilitating smooth lithium metal deposition. The superior oxidation resistance of our electrolyte enables the Li||NCM811&#8197;cell to deliver a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at an ultrahigh cut&#8211;off voltage of 4.8&#8197;V. Additionally, a pioneering 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 stably cycles for 110&#8197;cycles under harsh conditions of high cathode loading (30&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), low N/P ratio (1.18), and lean electrolytes (2.3&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1).

         <title>Regulating the Scaling Relations in Ammonia Synthesis through a Light&#8208;Driven Bendable Seesaw Effect on Tailored Iron Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepped {110} surface of the prepared &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s exposes abundant C7 sites with moderate EN, achieving a delicate balance in scaling relations and thermal catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis. A novel light&#8208;induced &#8220;bendable seesaw effect&#8221; resulting from hot electron transfer between catalyst and adsorbates was discovered to regulate the scaling relations and further significantly enhances the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advancing the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process faces significant challenges due to the intrinsic constraints of scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we reported an approach of bending the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; to regulate the scaling relations over a tailored &#945;&#8208;Fe metallic material (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s), realizing highly efficient light&#8208;driven thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis with a rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without additional heating. Specifically, the thermal catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was significantly enhanced by the novel stepped {110} surface, exhibiting a 3.8&#8208;fold increase compared to the commercial fused&#8208;iron catalyst with promoters at 350&#8201;&#176;C. The photo&#8208;induced hot electron transfer further accelerates the dinitrogen dissociation and hydrogenation simultaneously, effectively overcoming the limitation of scaling relation over identical sites. Consequently, the ammonia production rate of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was further enhanced by 30&#8197;times at the same temperature with irradiation. This work designs an efficient and sustainable system for ammonia synthesis and provides a novel approach for regulating the scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Modulating the Bader Charge Transfer in Single p&#8208;Block Atoms Doped Pd Metallene for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the Bader charge transfer between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates (*OO) via p&#8208;d electronic interaction on single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal doped Pd metallene (M&#8722;Pd metallene, M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) with only 4&#8211;5 atomic layers thickness enable efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Metallene is considered as an emerging family of electrocatalysts due to its atomically layered structure and unique surface stress. Here we propose a strategy to modulate the Bader charge transfer (BCT) between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates via p&#8208;d electronic interaction by introducing single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal (M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) into Pd metallene nanosheets towards efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that doping p&#8208;block metals could facilitate electron transfer to Pd sites and thus downshift the d&#8208;band center of Pd and weaken the adsorption energy of O intermediates. Among them, the developed Bi&#8722;Pd metallene shows extraordinarily high ORR mass activity of 11.34&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and 0.86&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V and 0.95&#8197;V in alkaline solution, respectively, representing the best Pd&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts ever reported. In the cathode of a Zinc&#8208;air battery, Bi&#8722;Pd metallene could achieve an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.546&#8197;V and keep stable for 760&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations suggest that the BCT between Pd surface and *OO intermediates greatly affects the bond length between them (dPd&#8208;*OO) and Bi doping could appropriately reduce the amount of BCT and stretch the dPd&#8208;*OO, thus enhancing the ORR activity.

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrapodal hole&#8208;collecting monolayer materials based on a saddle&#8208;like cyclooctatetraene core were developed. These molecules were found to form monolayers on transparent electrode substrates, with some phosphonic acid anchoring groups pointing upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. The perovskite solar cell devices using these hole&#8208;collecting monolayers exhibit high power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and good operational stability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a &#960;&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and 21.4&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1&#8197;cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62&#8197;cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability. This work represents how structural modification of multipodal molecules could substantially modulate the functions of the hole&#8208;collecting monolayers after being adsorbed onto TCO substrates.

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <title>Palladium(0) and Br&#248;nsted Acid Co&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydro&#8208;Cyclization of 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Hydrazones and Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction of 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes has been developed, through Pd0 and Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation followed by intramolecular allylic amination or etherification. A broad collection of dihydropyrazoles and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively, are constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to furnish multifunctional building blocks.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydro&#8208;functionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has been well explored, but most reactions focus on electron&#8208;neutral substrates in an intermolecular manner. Here we first demonstrate that readily available 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes can be efficiently utilized in the hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction under co&#8208;catalysis of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a chiral palladium complex, furnishing multifunctional dihydropyrazones and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively. Diverse substitution patterns for both types of electron&#8208;deficient diene compounds are tolerated, and corresponding heterocycles were generally constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to access products with higher molecular complexity and diversity. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations support that &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation of dienyl substrates by acid and concurrent &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of Pd0 complex is energetically favoured in the formation of active &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates, and an outer&#8208;sphere allylic amination or etherification mode is adopted to deliver the observed cyclized products enantioselectively.

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;Modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IEIs between Ag and Co3O4 significantly strengthen NO3&#8722; adsorption and stabilize CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4, while suppressing H2 production. The synergistic effect of multiple active sites realizes tandem catalysis: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites whereas NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to NH3 at Co sites.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86&#8201;%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11&#8201;%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100&#8201;%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81&#8197;times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8722;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic Cu&#8722;Cu pairs with a controllable site distance by first&#8208;shell halogen coordination was reported in this work, which shows an enhanced CO2RR performance of C2 products. In addition, a linear scaling relationship that that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites is accelerated to C2H4 generation, while short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites is beneficial for C2H5OH formation was revealed to give a wide comprehension towards site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8722;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1&#8201;%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites are accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites are beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites.

         <title>Stereodivergency in Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Difunctionalizations: The Impact of Boron Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent borylative difunctionalization strategy is reported. The key component in obtaining stereodivergence lies in the Lewis acidity of the introduced boron group. The more Lewis acidic Bpin group enables chelation control affording an all cis diastereomer. Conversely, the less acidic Bdan group overrides this preference by disfavouring adduct formation, leading to a bifurcation in the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A reagent&#8208;controlled diastereodivergent copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative difunctionalization is reported. The formation of Lewis adducts that guide selectivity is commonly invoked in organic reaction mechanisms. Using density functional theory calculations, we identified BpinBdan as a sterically similar and less Lewis acidic alternative to B2pin2. Using a newly developed borylative aldol domino reaction as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate a change in stereochemical outcome by a simple change of borylating reagent&#8212;B2pin2 affords the diastereomer associated with coordination control while BpinBdan overturns this mode of binding. We show that this strategy can be generalized to other scaffolds and, more importantly, that BpinBdan does not alter the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction when coordination is not involved. BpinBdan can be viewed as a mechanistic probe for coordination in future copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation reactions.

         <title>Subsets of Nanometer Vesicles in the Fly Release Differential Fractions of Vesicular Serotonin Content during Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin from neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster was measured using nanoelectrochemical approaches. Differential release fractions were observed upon drug treatment. This is the first example of consistent full release found in any system, suggesting the possibility for one pool of vesicles to release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis.







Abstract
Serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is important in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. Malfunction of serotonin signaling leads to various disorders. We studied serotonin signaling from serotonergic neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster. Serotonergic neurons and stimulated release were visualized and achieved with mCherry and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (an optogenetically transfected ion channel), respectively, and two electrochemical techniques quantified serotonin release and vesicular content. Mean vesicular serotonin content released during exocytosis from these neurons was 84&#8201;%, considerably higher than reported in previous studies regarding octopamine (4.5&#8201;%) and glutamate release (31&#8201;%). Serotonin content within all vesicles is uniformly changed when serotonin concentration is inhibited or enhanced. However, serotonin release exhibits two Gaussian distributions: higher frequency of small release events, and similar or slightly higher frequency of large events, resulting in differential release fractions ranging from partial (13&#8211;18&#8201;%) to full (100&#8201;%) release after treatment with agents to either enhance or diminish release. This is the first example of consistent full exocytotic release events we have observed in any system. We suggest one pool of vesicles can release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis, a potentially novel pathway to regulate exocytosis and neuronal signaling.

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Cobalt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of local gradient magnetic field&#8208;assisted in situ reconstruction is developed to directionally modulate the reconstruction of CoBDC in ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell precatalyst. The Kelvin force induced by gradient magnetic field can increase the proportion of divalent Co in the derived CoOxHy, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity compared to the reconstructed sample without gradient magnetic field assistance.







Abstract
The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128&#8201;% at 1.63&#8197;V and an overpotential reduction by 28&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100&#8197;h.

     alt="Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Cobalt-Based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new strategy of local gradient magnetic field-assisted in situ reconstruction is developed to directionally modulate the reconstruction of CoBDC in ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CoBDC core&#8211;shell precatalyst. The Kelvin force induced by gradient magnetic field can increase the proportion of divalent Co in the derived CoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity compared to the reconstructed sample without gradient magnetic field assistance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@CoBDC core&#8211;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen-containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128&#8201;% at 1.63&#8197;V and an overpotential reduction by 28&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100&#8197;h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant fluorescence improvement and considerable piezochromism are firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Pressure&#8208;induced photocurrent enhancement is also observed, because of the promoted electron orbitals coupling resulting from the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1&#8197;atm to 2.5&#8197;GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8722;I&#8722;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.

         <title>Thermotropic &#8220;Plumber's Nightmare&#8221;&#8212;A Tight Liquid Organic Double Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A most common cubic phase in lyotropic (surfactant&#8208;water) systems, the &#8220;plumber's nightmare&#8221; labyrinth, has never been found in thermotropic liquid crystals. Here the first example is reported. Intriguingly, removal of just a methyl branch from the fluorescent mesogen's six alkyls converts the double&#8208;network cubic into an array of counter&#8208;twisting helices.







Abstract
Gyroid, double diamond and the body&#8208;centred &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; are the three most common bicontinuous cubic phases in lyotropic liquid crystals and block copolymers. While the first two are also present in solvent&#8208;free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six&#8208;fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod&#8208;like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side&#8208;branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side&#8208;chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod&#8208;like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end&#8208;chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework&#8208;forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry&#8208;based explanation is given.

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid enantiomers (L/D&#8208;UG) are designed to self&#8208;assemble into vesicles and 2D nanocrystals with different chirality and curvature, which showed differentiated protein adsorption and subsequent osteogenesis. L&#8208;2D nanocrystal exhibits as one of the most effective materials to promote bone regeneration.







Abstract
Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures&#8217; interaction with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG molecules can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins, determined by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption by Unconventional p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization over Porous High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Metallene for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>

         <dc:description>
A porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene was synthesized and demonstrated high performance for electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO). Experimental and theoretical studies validated that unconventional p&#8208;d orbital hybridization could tune the local electronic structure of active sites to manipulate active hydrogen supply, which facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates and promotes the formation of C6H11NO.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO) from cyclohexanone (C6H10O) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a promising alternative to traditional environment&#8208;unfriendly industrial technologies for green synthesis of C6H11NO. Precisely controlling the reaction pathway of the C6H10O/NOx&#8208;involved electrochemical reductive coupling reaction is crucial for selectively producing C6H11NO, which is yet still challenging. Herein, we report a porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene (HEA&#8208;PdCuAgBiInene) to boost the electrosynthesis of C6H11NO from C6H10O and nitrite, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (47.6&#8201;%) and almost 100&#8201;% yield under ambient conditions. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that unconventional orbital hybridization between d&#8208;block metals and p&#8208;block metals could regulate the local electronic structure of active sites and induce electron localization of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, which tunes the active hydrogen supply, facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates NH2OH* and C6H10O*, and efficiently promotes their C&#8722;N coupling to selectively produce C6H11NO.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization for Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy was utilized to rapidly prepare electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films at room temperature, which exhibited stable polymorphic electrochromic properties. Additionally, the electrochromic behavior of COFs films at negative potentials can be regulated by uranium, demonstrating the unique color tunability of COFs.







Abstract
A rapid in situ synthesis of electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (EC&#8208;COFs) was proposed by using green electrochemical interface polymerization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine (TPDA) and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde (DHBD). The synthetized TPDA&#8208;DHBD films exhibit stable polymorphic color variations under different applied potentials, which can be attributed to the redox state changes of bis(triphenylamine) and imine electroactive functional groups within the COFs skeleton. TPDA&#8208;DHBD represents markedly different electrochromisms from red to cyan due to the steric hindrance effect caused by the presence of UO22+, demonstrating the unique tunability of COFs materials. This work offers a new feasible idea for rapid EC&#8208;COFs synthesis and tunable EC&#8208;COFs realization.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones as well as &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds through a CO&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) process.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation and hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed, enabling highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#945;&#8208;alkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams in good yields. The mild reaction conditions allow use of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes bearing a variety of functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds through a CO&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) process, in which a cationic acylcobalt(IV) complex is proposed as the key intermediate.

         <title>Mechanochemically Promoted Functionalization of Postconsumer Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) and Poly(&#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene) for Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable bulk depolymerization by chemically recycling to monomer utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. When sonicated in the presence of a depolymerizable trigger, postconsumer PMMA and PAMS can achieve up to 82&#8201;% depolymerization. High&#8208;purity monomer is collected and used in new materials. This method of functionalization is particularly effective with Mn&gt;1&#8197;million kg/mol polymers, offering a sustainable solution for plastic waste management.







Abstract
We describe a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable subsequent bulk depolymerization to monomer by utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. By harnessing ultrasonic chain&#8208;scission in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide methacrylate (PhthMA), we successfully chain&#8208;end functionalize polymers to promote subsequent depolymerization in bulk, achieving up to 82 % depolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene) (PAMS) within 30&#8197;min. This method of depolymerization yields a high&#8208;purity monomer that can be repolymerized. Moreover, as compared to the most common methods of depolymerization, this work is most efficient with ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers, establishing a method with the potential to address highly persistent, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone plastic materials. Lastly, we demonstrate the expansion of this depolymerization method to commercial cell cast PMMA, achieving high degrees of depolymerization from post&#8208;consumer waste. This work is the first demonstration of applying PhthMA&#8208;promoted depolymerization strategies in homopolymer PMMA and PAMS prepared by conventional polymerization methods.

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.

         <title>Development of Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles with Low Immunogenicity and Their Application in the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low immunogenicity were developed as novel gene delivery platforms by incorporating Dex (dLNPs) to alleviate side effects induced by traditional LNPs. Lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs delivered siRUNX1 for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with superior therapeutic performance owing to the synergy of gene and drug therapy. They provide a blueprint for the design of RNA therapeutics with higher efficacy and safety.







Abstract
As the most advanced non&#8208;viral delivery system, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were approved by the FDA, propelling the advancements of gene therapy. However, their clinical applications are hampered by the potential immunogenicity of the lipid components that trigger immune&#8208;related adverse events, like inflammation and allergy.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a deep&#8208;red emissive sulfur&#8208;doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.







Abstract
Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.

         <title>Aldehyde End&#8208;Capped Degradable Polyethylenes From Hydrogen&#8208;Controlled Ethylene/CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from three large&#8208;scale feedstocks of ethylene + carbon monoxide + hydrogen, direct hydrogen&#8208;controlled non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of CO and ethylene produces aldehyde end&#8208;capped polyethylene (PE) materials with in&#8208;chain isolated keto group, whose molecular weight and chain endgroup could be modulated by H2. Such semicrystalline PE could undergo photodegradation to oily derivatives.







Abstract
To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in&#8208;chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen&#8208;controlled E/CO non&#8208;alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non&#8208;alternating in&#8208;chain keto groups (1.0&#8211;9.3&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195&#8197;kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer's molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non&#8208;alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non&#8208;alternating structure (&gt;99&#8201;%) for the keto&#8208;PE. The dispersed incorporation of in&#8208;chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.

         <title>Dual Redox&#8208;active Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Memristors for Highly&#8208;efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method to synthesize highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks containing dual redox&#8208;active units. The synergistic effect of these units significantly reduces the redox energy barrier and improves the efficiency of neuromorphic computation.







Abstract
Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8722;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13&#8201;% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56&#8201;% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.
