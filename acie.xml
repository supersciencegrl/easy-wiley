         <title>A Widespread Glycosidase Confers Lobophorin Resistance and Host&#8208;Dependent Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying new environmental resistance determinants is significant to combat rising antibiotic resistance. Herein we report the unexpected correlation of a lobophorin (LOB) resistance&#8208;related glycosidase KijX with the host&#8208;dependent chemical diversity of LOBs, by a process of glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation. KijX homologs are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs. The crystal structure of AcvX (a KijX homolog) shows a similar fold to that of the glycoside hydrolase family 113 and a special negatively charged groove to accommodate and deglycosylate LOBs. Antagonistic assays indicate kijX as a defense weapon of actinomycetes to combat LOB producers in environment, reflecting an elegant coevolution relationship. Our study provides insights into the KijX&#8208;related glycosidases as preexisting resistance determinants and represents an example of resistance genes accidentally integrated into natural product assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Electron Trap&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation for Efficient Photocatalytic HydrogenProduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solar&#8208;driven evolution of hydrogen from water using particulate photocatalysts is considered one of the most economical and promising protocols for achieving a stable supply of renewable energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting is far from satisfactory due to the sluggish electron&#8211;hole pair separation kinetics. Herein, isolated Mo atoms in a high oxidation state have been incorporated into the lattice of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS@Mo) nanorods, which exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 11.32 mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (226.4 &#181;mol h&#8208;1; catalyst dosage 20 mg). Experimental and theoretical simulation results imply that the highly oxidized Mo species lead to mobile&#8208;charge imbalances in CZS and induce the directional photogenerated electrons transfer, resulting in effectively inhibited electron&#8208;hole recombination and greatly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiroligomer&#8208;Based Macrocycles for Atomically Precise Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a new class of peptidomimetic macrocycles with well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structures and low conformational flexibility. They are assembled from fused&#8208;ring spiro&#8208;ladder oligomers (spiroligomers) by modular solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance confirms their shape persistency. Triangular macrocycles of tunable sizes assemble into membranes with atomically precise pores, which exhibit size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving towards a series of structurally similar compounds. The exceptional structural diversity and stability of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles will be explored for more applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the CO Oxidation Mechanism over a Molecularly Defined Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating the reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis is critically important for catalyst development, yet remains challenging because of the often unclear nature of the active sites. Using a molecularly defined copper single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on a UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu/UiO&#8208;66), allows a detailed mechanistic elucidation of the CO oxidation reaction. Based on a combination of in situ / operando spectroscopies, kinetic measurements including kinetic isotope effects, and density functional theory&#8208;based calculations, we identified the active site, reaction intermediates, and transition states of the dominant reaction cycle as well as the changes in oxidation/spin state during reaction. The reaction involves the continuous reactive dissociation of adsorbed O2, by reaction of O2,ad with COad, leading to the formation of an O atom connecting the Cu center with a neighboring Zr4+ ion as rate limiting step. This is removed in a second activated step.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern Strategies for Carbon Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to stable and natural abundant carbon&#8208;12, the synthesis of organic molecules with carbon (radio)isotopes must be conceived and optimized in order to navigate through the hurdles of radiochemical requirements, such as high costs of the starting materials, harsh conditions and radioactive waste generation. In addition, it must initiate from the small cohort of available C&#8208;labeled building blocks. For long time, multi&#8208;step approaches have represented the sole available patterns. On the other side, the development of chemical reactions based on the reversible cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds might offer new opportunities and reshape retrosynthetic analysis in radiosynthesis. This review aims to provide a short survey on the recently emerged carbon isotope exchange (CIE) technologies that provide effective opportunity for late&#8208;stage labeling. At present, such strategies have relied on the use of primary and easily accessible radiolabeled C1&#8208;building blocks, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and cyanides, while the activation principles have been based on thermal, photocatalytic, metal&#8208;catalyzed and biocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Separation in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Heterogeneous Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) enabled heterogeneous thiol catalysis has been achieved for the first time. MOF Zr&#8208;TPDCS&#8208;1, consisting of Zr6&#8208;clusters and TPDCS linkers (TPDCS = 3,3&#8217;&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramercapto[1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate), effectively catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. Upon irradiation, the fast electron transfer from TPDCS to Zr6&#8208;cluster is believed to facilitate the formation of the thiyl radical, a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, which competently abstracts the hydrogen from borane, silane, phosphine, or thiol for generating the corresponding element radical to engender the chemical transformations. The elaborate control experiments evidenced the generation of thiyl radicals in MOF and illustrated a radical reaction pathway. The gram&#8208;scale reaction worked well, and the product was conveniently separated via centrifugation and vacuum with a turnover number (TON) of ~3880, highlighting the practical application potential of heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Pulse&#8208;Driven Periodic Self&#8208;Repair of Cu&#8208;Ni Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction sustainably produces ammonia and alleviates water pollution, yet challenging due to the kinetic mismatch and hydrogen evolution competition.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction sustainably produces ammonia and alleviates water pollution, yet challenging due to the kinetic mismatch and hydrogen evolution competition.

         <dc:description>Endosomal escape remains a central issue limiting the high protein expression of mRNA therapeutics. Here, we present second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II dye conjugated lipid (Cy&#8208;lipid) for potentiating mRNA delivery efficiencyvia stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy. In acidic endosomal microenvironment, Cy&#8208;lipid is protonated and turns on NIR&#8208;II absorption for light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transduction mediated by 1064 nm laser irradiation. Then, the heat&#8208;promoted LNPs morphology change triggers rapid escape of NIR&#8208;II LNPs from the endosome, allowing about 3&#8208;fold enhancement of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding mRNA translation capacity compared to the NIR&#8208;II light free group. And the bioluminescence intensity induced by delivered luciferase encoding mRNA in mouse liver region shows positive correlation with incremental radiation dose, indicating the validity of the SPEED strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable, and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination into a commercial epoxy matrix has led to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The polymers show excellent mechanical properties, environmental stability, shape memory, and recyclability, which could be useful for anticounterfeiting, data encryption, and information editing applications.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance for practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination are incorporated into a commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultralong RTP (&#964;=540.4&#8197;ms), and shape memory behavior. Notably, there is no apparent decrease in the RTP property upon prolonged immersion in various solvents because the networks are robust. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. These novel properties have led to their potential application for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Support Boosts Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel interface chemistry manipulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) before the self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) by constructing a novel 2D/2D heterostructure composed of NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical studies verify the thermodynamically favorable process of UOR on the Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), however, their activity is largely limited by the inevitable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) during the UOR. Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term durability for more than 330&#8197;h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.

         <title>Supercharged CO2 Photothermal Catalytic Methanation: High Conversion, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride photothermal catalyst for enabling the Solar Sabatier process is reported that reduces the energy intensity of the thermo&#8208;catalytic version, yet maintains an amazing Sabatier conversion of 87.68&#8201;%, a reaction rate of 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity under ambient pressure conditions. Together these attributes are considered a prerequisite for scaling the process to a technology relevant level.







Abstract
To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO2 methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto&#8208;chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.

         <title>Entropic Contributions to Sodium Solvation and Solvent Stabilization upon Electrochemical Sodium Deposition from Diglyme and Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropic contributions to the free enthalpy may significantly influence the equilibrium potential of an electrode in a battery system. By microcalorimetric measurements of Na deposition from a diglyme solution, we show that solvation entropy destabilizes the Na+ in solution by about 0.7&#8197;eV, thus strongly increasing the stability of the electrolyte solution upon Na deposition and affecting the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na+ in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na+ deposition in DG of &#916;R
234&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 (c.f.: &#916;R
83&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na+ in DG by about 0.73&#8197;eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na+ reduction. We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na+, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition in DG of &#916;&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;
234&#8197;J&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (c.f.: &#916;&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;
83&#8197;J&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in DG by about 0.73&#8197;eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Composition of Nickel&#8208;Iron Nanoparticles for Abiotic CO2 Conversion to Early Prebiotic Organics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high temperature and pressure, synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles catalyze H2&#8208;dependent CO2 fixation to form the main intermediates of the acetyl&#8208;CoA pathway (e.g., formate, acetate, and pyruvate). The reported chemistry is reminiscent of hydrothermal vents, which yield large amounts of H2 in the presence of transition metals and are implicated in forming the first biochemical pathways through CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Abiotic synthesis of formate and short hydrocarbons takes place in serpentinizing vents where some members of vent microbial communities live on abiotic formate as their main carbon source. To better understand the catalytic properties of Ni&#8722;Fe minerals that naturally exist in hydrothermal vents, we have investigated the ability of synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe based nanoparticular solids to catalyze the H2&#8208;dependent reduction of CO2, the first step required for the beginning of pre&#8208;biotic chemistry. Mono and bimetallic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles with varied Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios transform CO2 and H2 into intermediates and products of the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A pathway&#8212;formate, acetate, and pyruvate&#8212;in mM range under mild hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, Ni&#8722;Fe catalysts converted CO2 to similar products without molecular H2 by using water as a hydrogen source. Both CO2 chemisorption analysis and post&#8208;reaction characterization of materials indicate that Ni and Fe metals play complementary roles for CO2 fixation.

         <title>Close&#8208;Shell Reductive Elimination versus Open&#8208;Shell Radical Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activations by Computation and Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of site&#8208;selectivity for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and arylation have been illuminated by means of density functional theory calculations. The competition between close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and open&#8208;shell radical attack is responsible for the ortho&#8208; versus meta&#8208;selectivity, for which a multi&#8208;linear regression model, predicting the site&#8208;selection, was devised and tested experimentally.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond activation&#8208;assisted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a useful tool to forge distal C&#8722;C bonds. However, given the limited number of mechanistic studies, a clear understanding of the origin of the site&#8208;selectivity and the complete reaction pattern is not available. Here, we present systematic computational studies on ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl bromides and aryl bromides. The C&#8722;H scission and the C&#8722;C formation were carefully examined. Monocyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes were identified as the active species, which then underwent inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer (ISET) to activate the organic bromides. The site&#8208;selectivity results from the competition between the close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and the open&#8208;shell radical coupling. Based on this mechanistic understanding, a multilinear regression model was built to predict the site&#8208;selectivity, which was further validated by experiments.

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective activation of PtIV prodrugs upon irradiation is receiving much interest. The majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection and were able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We doped yitterbium ions into perovskite nanocrystal hosts for extending their electroluminescence wavelength towards 1000&#8197;nm. The synergy of halide&#8208;stoichiometry control and surface passivation enables us to achieve an efficient near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency among organic LEDs and perovskite LEDs with peak wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm to date.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size&#8208; and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible range. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into a PeNCs host (Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000&#8197;nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum&#8208;cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126&#8201;% from the Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs. Through halide&#8208;composition engineering and surface passivation to improve both PLQY and charge&#8208;transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;% at a central wavelength of 990&#8197;nm, representing the most efficient perovskite&#8208;based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm.

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of the triplet excited state by utilizing an aromatic amide skeleton has led to ultralong blue phosphorescence in confined films. Strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling within the aromatic amide as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with polyvinyl alcohol accelerate intersystem crossing and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations, thereby overcoming the dilemma of achieving organic phosphorescence with both high energy and long lifetime.







Abstract
We describe an aromatic amide skeleton for manipulation of triplet excited states toward bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the aromatic amides can promote strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling between (&#960;,&#960;*) and the bridged (n,&#960;*) states, and enable multiple channels to populate the emissive 3(&#960;,&#960;*), as well as facilitate robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress non&#8208;radiative relaxations. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 34.7&#8201;%) in confined films are achieved. The blue afterglow of the films can last for several seconds and are showcased in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and white light afterglow. Owing to the high population of 3(&#960;,&#960;*) states, the smart aromatic amide skeleton provides an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence with various colors.

&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of the triplet excited state by utilizing an aromatic amide skeleton has led to ultralong blue phosphorescence in confined films. Strong spin-orbit coupling within the aromatic amide as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with polyvinyl alcohol accelerate intersystem crossing and suppress the non-radiative relaxations, thereby overcoming the dilemma of achieving organic phosphorescence with both high energy and long lifetime.

         <title>A Cooperative Rhodium/Secondary Phosphine Oxide [Rh/P(O)nBu2] Template for Catalytic Hydrodefluorination of Perfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination of perfluoroarenes is presented. Aside from substrates with electron&#8208;withdrawing functionalities, the system showed a high tolerance for challenging electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. Mechanistic studies and a density functional theory study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride as a catalytic species and the critical role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment.







Abstract
The selective activation of C&#8722;F bonds under mild reaction conditions remains an ongoing challenge of bond activation. Here, we present a cooperative [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of perfluoroarenes. In addition to substrates presenting electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, the system showed an exceedingly rare tolerance for electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Empirical mechanistic studies and a density functional theory (DFT) study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride complex as a catalytically relevant species and the determining role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment. Altogether, we demonstrate that molecular templates based on these design elements can be assembled to create catalysts with increased reactivity for challenging bond activations.

         <title>Armor&#8208;like Inorganic&#8208;rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by the Pentafluorophenylboronic Acid Additive for High&#8208;voltage Li||NCM622 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;voltage stability of NCM622 is realized by armor&#8208;like CEI via electrolyte engineering, where the armored lithium borate surrounded on the CEI surface represses the dissolution of CEI moieties and improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed across whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) comprising Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathode could potentially realize high capacity and power density. However, suitable electrolytes to tolerate the oxidation on the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage are urgently needed. Herein, we present an armor&#8208;like inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) strategy for exploring oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolytes for sustaining 4.8&#8197;V Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) batteries with pentafluorophenylboronic acid (PFPBA) as the additive. In such CEI, the armored lithium borate surrounded by CEI up&#8208;layer represses the dissolution of inner CEI moieties and also improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed over whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability and Li+ conductivity compared with polymer moieties. With such robust Li+ conductive CEI, the Li||NCM622 battery delivered excellent stability at 4.6&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage with 91.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles. The excellent cycling performance was also obtained even at 4.8&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects in a Distannene/Tristannane Equilibrium: Energies of their Interconversion and the Suppression of the Monomeric Stannylene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3, affords an equilibrium mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2, and cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3, which suppresses monomer dissociation. Multinuclear NMR and computational analyses indicated that DED interactions are the main arbiter of the dimer&#8208;trimer thermal interconversion.







Abstract
Reaction of {LiC6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3&#8901;Et2O}2 (Cyp=cyclopentyl) (1) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6&#8208;triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl2 afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2 (2), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3 (3). 2 is favored in solution at higher temperature (345&#8197;K or above) whereas 3 is preferred near 298&#8197;K. Van't Hoff analysis revealed the 3 to 2 conversion has a &#916;H=33.36&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S=0.102&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, which gives a &#916;G300 K=+2.86&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, showing that the conversion of 3 to 2 is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in 3 is &#8722;28.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2 unit, which exceeds the DED energy in 2 of &#8722;16.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the 3 to 2 equilibrium. Both 2 and 3 possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).

         <title>Nickel&#8208;promoted Electrocatalytic Graphitization of Biochars for Energy Storage: Mechanistic Understanding using Multi&#8208;scale Approaches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a catalytic process of nickel&#8208;promoted electrochemical graphitization in the molten calcium chloride. Multi&#8208;scale approach from atomic reactions to macroscale cells is useful in understanding the mechanism of evolution in the electrolytic cell, the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the pathways of nickel&#8208;promoted graphitization and tubularization.







Abstract

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow CdS nanocages wrapped in ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were synthesized to form the hierarchical photocatalyst ZnIn2S4@CdS. Surface&#8208;exposed Zn acid centers and the Z&#8208;Scheme pathway between ZnIn2S4 and CdS promote the polarization of epoxide molecules and interfacial charge transfer, leading to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alcoholysis of epoxides.







Abstract
Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8722;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8722;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.

Naphthospironone A, a cytotoxic and antibacterial natural product, was synthesised for the first time. The key to construction of its spiro[bicyclo[3.2.1]octane&#8208;pyran] core was a two&#8208;step sequence involving hydrogenolytic debrominative olefin migration followed by a base&#8208;induced intramolecular aldol&#8208;type cyclisation.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions through Sulfur&#8208;Anchoring of Metal Catalysts on Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI phenomenons enabled carbon to synthesize a variety of catalysts with enhanced performance.







Abstract
In supported metal catalysts, the supports would strongly interact with the metal components instead of just acting as a carrier, which greatly affects both of their synthesis and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Carbon is considered as very important but inert support and thus hard to induce strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI between metal and sulfur&#8208;doped carbon (S&#8722;C) supports enables the catalysts with extraordinary resistance to sintering at high temperatures of up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, which allows the general synthesis of single&#8208;atom, alloy cluster, and intermetallic compound catalysts with high dispersion and metal loading for a variety of applications.

         <title>Photoinduced Fluorescence Switching in Molecular Aggregates by Topological [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.







Abstract
The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&#934;PL=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst and L&#8208;proline, a reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations is presented, which enables direct and diverse access to 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines.







Abstract
Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with l&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the l&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8722;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.

The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction-interrupted strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Extracting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs as emerging crystalline porous materials have shown great potential for water harvesting, as their high porosity and exposed polar sites promote the sorption of water and penetrative pore channels accelerate water diffusions. Various strategies of designing high&#8208;performance COF sorbents in thermodynamics and dynamics are presented by accentuating the critical relationships between structures and water sorption properties.







Abstract
Water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue due to global population growth and industrialization. One effective approach to addressing this issue is sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of porous crystalline material that have emerged as promising sorbents for water harvesting due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, and customizable pore chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we provide an overview of the different types of COFs, their structural characteristics, and the diverse linkage chemistries used to construct them. Then, we summarize recent advances in using COF&#8208;based sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, including strategies for controlling sorption properties and optimizing performance in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges associated with improving the efficiency of COF&#8208;based SAWH systems.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Zinc Adeninate Framework (ZAF) for Immobilization of Catalytic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective immobilization and delivery of genetic materials is at the forefront of biological and medical research directed toward tackling scientific challenges such as gene therapy, and cancer treatment. Here we present a biologically inspired hydrogen bonded zinc adeninate framework (ZAF) consisting of zinc adeninate macrocycles that self&#8208;assemble into a 3D framework via adenine&#8208;adenine interactions. ZAF can efficiently immobilize DNAzyme with full protection against enzyme degradation and physiological conditions until it is successfully delivered into the nucleus. Compared to zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZAFs are 2&#8208;folds more biocompatible with a significant loading efficiency of 96%. Overall, our design paves the way for expanding functional hydrogen&#8208;bonded&#8208;based systems as potential platforms for the loading and delivery of biologics.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials ~250 mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;specific Poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) Copolymers via Chemoselective Terpolymerization Controlled by the Stoichiometric Ratio of Phosphazene/Triethylborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoselective terpolymerization can produce polymer materials with diverse compositions and sequential structures, and thus have attracted considerable attention in the field of polymer synthesis. However, the intrinsic complexity of three&#8208;component system also brings great chanllenge, in regard to the reactivity and selectivity of different monomers. Herein, we report the terpolymerization of CO2/epoxide/anhydride by a binary organocatalytic C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB (triethylborane) system. Both the activity and chemoselectivity were highly dependent upon the molar ratio of C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3 to TEB, and sequence&#8208;controlled poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers were readily synthesized through one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step methodology by tuning the stoichiometric ratio of phosphazene/TEB. In particular, C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 exhibited an unprecedentedly high chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CO2/CHO. Thus, well&#8208;defined triblock polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polycarbonate copolymers can be produced from the mixture of CO2, CHO and PA using a bifunctional initiator. With C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB = 1/1, tapered copolymers were obtained, while random copolymers with high content of polycarbonate (PC) were synthesized with further increasing the amount of TEB. The mechanism of the unexpected chemoselectivity was further investigated by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphorescence of organic materials is highly dependent on intermolecular interactions, for the sensitive triplet excitons toward environment and aggregated structures. However, until now, relationship between phosphorescence and intermolecular interactions is still unclear for complicated influence factors and uncontrollable aggregated behaviors. Herein, taking temperature as the controlled variable, the afterglow can continuously change from blue to green, then to yellow, even achieve the white emission with deuteration process. It is mainly due to the hierarchical architectures of molecular aggregates with rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, as well as gradually unlocking process of interactions with different energies. Accordingly, the one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between the determinate interactions and excited triplet states have been established, guiding accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Reusable Edge&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Free Polyphthalocyanine Networks for Efficient Polymer Synthesis at Near Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalysts are highly advantageous for industrial applications owing to their distinctive merits including easy separation and effective recovery. However, utilizing heterogeneous photocatalysts to harness longer wavelength light remains a critical area of research. This contribution explores the use of edge&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc&#8208;x) to promote efficient polymer synthesis under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Our screening process revealed that both phenyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;p) and naphthyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;n) offer promising performance for photopolymerization. With the assistance of ppm&#8208;level PPc&#8208;n catalyst, well&#8208;defined polymers were synthesized within a few hours under the regulation of three NIR lights, regardless of shielded by synthetic and biological barriers. An excellent control over the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution was achieved. Furthermore, PPc&#8208;x can be easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles, with negligible leaching and maintenance of the catalytic performance. This study expands a new avenue in developing versatile photocatalysts for the modern synthetic toolkits and offer benefits in diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aminocyclobutane Monoesters: Synthesis and Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminocyclobutane monoesters starting from commercially available reagents is reported. The obtained strained rings undergo (4+2) dearomative annulation with indole partners using silylium catalysis. This organocatalyzed annulation provided tricyclic indolines with four new stereocenters in up to quantitative yield and &gt;95:5 diastereoselectivity and can proceed both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction. This divergent outcome could be rationalized based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last decade, the biological relevance of certain f&#8208;elements &#8211; the lanthanides &#8211; was established in the context of methylotrophic bacteria. The respective strains incorporate these 4f&#8209;elements into the active site of one of their key metabolic enzymes, a lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase. Here, we investigate if actinides, the radioactive 5f&#8209;elements, can replace the essential 4f&#8208;elements in lanthanide&#8208;dependent bacterial metabolism. Growth studies with Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV and the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 &#916;mxaF&#8208;mutant demonstrate that americium and curium support growth in the absence of lanthanides. Moreover, strain SolV favors these actinides over late lanthanides, when presented to a mixture of equal amounts of lanthanides together with americium and curium. Bacterial uptake is confirmed by time&#8208;resolved laser&#8208;induced fluorescence spectroscopy, liquid scintillation counting, and inductively&#8208;coupled plasma mass&#8208;spectrometry. Additionally, we show catalytic activity of the lanthanide&#8208;dependent enzyme upon reconstitution with actinides. Our combined in&#160;vivo and in vitro results establish that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their one&#8208;carbon metabolism; if they possess the correct size and a +III oxidation state. Furthermore, bacteria capable of utilizing actinides will be able to mobilize these elements in the environment. This may lead to applications for bioremediation and recycling/separation of lanthanides and actinides.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Using a Fluorescence Nanoprobe for the Detection and Imaging of Phosphorylation and Glucose Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring the early stage of atherosclerosis (AS) without plaque formation is of great significance. Herein, we developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence nanoprobe to analyze the progression of AS by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF with iodine (I3&#8208;)&#8208;rhodamine B (RhB) associate, which realizes the specific recognition of target object through the metal joint Zr(IV) and I3&#8208;&#8208;RhB, respectively. We investigated different stages of target object changes in the early non&#8208;plaque stage of AS in blood. It was found that the levels of phosphate and glucose in the blood were higher than those of the normal mice. The results of two&#8208;photon images showed that early AS mice had higher levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a suitable fluorescence tool for further revealing the pathogenesis and progression of AS.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Essential Amino Acids from Nitric Oxide Using Atomically Dispersed Fe on N&#8208;doped Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to transfer industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;values product is significantly important and challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative method for artificial synthesis of essential &#945;&#8208;amino acids from nitric oxide (NO) by reacting with &#945;&#8208;keto acids through electrocatalytic process with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (AD&#8208;Fe/NC) as the catalyst. A yield of valine with 32.1 &#956;mol mgcat&#8208;1 is delivered at &#8211;0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding a selectivity of 11.3%. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopy analyses show that NO as nitrogen source converted to hydroxylamine that promptly nucleophilic attacked on the electrophilic carbon center of &#945;&#8208;keto acid to form oxime and subsequent reductive hydrogenation occurred on the way to amino acid. Over 6 kinds of &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been successfully synthesized and gaseous nitrogen source can be also replaced by liquid nitrogen source (NO3&#8208;). Our findings not only provide a creative method for converting nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;valued products, which is of epoch&#8208;making significance towards artificial synthesis of amino acids, but also benefit in deploying near&#8208;zero&#8208;emission technologies for global environmental and economic development.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Levocetirizine is an orally administrated, second&#8208;generation antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been used to treat allergy symptoms and long&#8208;term hives for over 25 years. Despite the wide use of this compound, its crystal structure has remained unknown. Here we report the application of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED)/microelectron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the crystal structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride directly from crystalline powders extracted from commercially available tablets containing the compound. We also showcased the utility of dynamical refinement to unambiguously assign absolute configuration. The results highlight the immense potential of 3D ED/MicroED) for structure elucidation of components of microcrystalline mixtures that obviates the need to grow large&#8208;size single crystals and the use of complementary analytical techniques, which could be important for identification as well as for primary structural characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane with a High Donor Additive for Efficient Anode Reversibility in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries is improved by regulating the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Pyridine (Py) as high donor number organic electrolyte additive (only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition) is used to efficiently regulate the solvation sheath structure, which results in depressed H2O activity at the IHP interface. The thus&#8208;formed IHP interface enables a superior stable Zn anode with high reversibility and utilization rate.







Abstract
The performance of aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) is highly dependent on inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Notorious parasitic reactions containing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and Zn dendrites both originate from abundant free H2O and random Zn deposition inside active IHP. Here, we report a universal high donor number (DN) additive pyridine (Py) with only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition (Py&#8208;to&#8208;H2O volume ratio), for regulating molecule distribution inside IHP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verify that incorporated Py additive could tailor Zn2+ solvation sheath and exclude H2O molecules from IHP effectively, which is in favor of preventing H2O decomposition. Consequently, even at extreme conditions such as high depth of discharge (DOD) of 80&#8201;%, the symmetric cell based on Py additive can sustain approximately 500&#8197;h long&#8208;term stability. This efficient strategy with high DN additives furnishes a promising direction for designing novel electrolytes and promoting the practical application of AZIBs, despite inevitably introducing trace organic additives.

The thus-formed IHP interface enables a superior stable Zn anode with high reversibility and utilization rate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) is highly dependent on inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Notorious parasitic reactions containing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and Zn dendrites both originate from abundant free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and random Zn deposition inside active IHP. Here, we report a universal high donor number (DN) additive pyridine (Py) with only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition (Py-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O volume ratio), for regulating molecule distribution inside IHP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verify that incorporated Py additive could tailor Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation sheath and exclude H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules from IHP effectively, which is in favor of preventing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O decomposition. Consequently, even at extreme conditions such as high depth of discharge (DOD) of 80&#8201;%, the symmetric cell based on Py additive can sustain approximately 500&#8197;h long-term stability. This efficient strategy with high DN additives furnishes a promising direction for designing novel electrolytes and promoting the practical application of AZIBs, despite inevitably introducing trace organic additives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free NiOx Nanocrystals: A Low&#8208;cost and Stable Hole Transport Material for Commercializing Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective hole transport material in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, Zhang et&#8197;al. summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs and their applications in different perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Advancing inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for commercial applications given their compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem photovoltaics, low&#8208;temperature processability (&#8804;100&#8201;&#176;C), and promising operational stability. Although inverted PSCs have achieved an efficiency of over 25&#8201;% using doped or expensive organic hole transport materials (HTMs), their synthesis cost and stability still cannot meet the requirements for their commercialization. Recently, dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective HTM in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, we summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs. Then, the applications of NiOx NCs in other perovskite optoelectronics beyond photovoltaics are discussed. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future development of NiOx NCs for the commercialization of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Approaching Theoretical Performances of Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by Cobalt&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts is studied through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic methods. When cathodically biased, a reconstruction in the symmetry of Co&#8722;Nx active sites is discovered, which leads to a shift in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction selectivity from producing water to hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied for environmentally benign applications. However, insufficient understanding of ORR 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway mechanism at the atomic level inhibits rational design of catalysts with both high activity and selectivity, causing concerns including catalyst degradation due to Fenton reaction or poor efficiency of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Herein we show that the generally accepted ORR electrocatalyst design based on a Sabatier volcano plot argument optimises activity but is unable to account for the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway selectivity. Through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic studies on a series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids, a construction&#8208;driven approach based on an extended &#8220;dynamic active site saturation&#8221; model that aims to create the maximum number of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR sites by directing the secondary ORR electron transfer towards the 2&#8201;e&#8722; intermediate is proven to be attainable by manipulating O2 hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>A Hydrogel Microneedle Assay Combined with Nucleic Acid Probes for On&#8208;Site Detection of Small Molecules and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a versatile microneedle (MN) biosensor applicable for detecting various clinical biomarkers&#8211;present in interstitial fluid&#8211;on&#8208;site and near a patient's point of care. Our MN&#8208;based biosensor has displayed accurate and reliable results at in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo settings when compared to benchmark assays. The developed MN paves the way for better health management and timely treatment.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of clinical biomarkers is critical to health monitoring and timely treatment, yet biosensing assays capable of detecting biomarkers without the need for costly external equipment and reagents are limited. Blood&#8208;based assays are, specifically, challenging as blood collection is invasive and follow&#8208;upprocessing is required. Here, we report a versatile assay that employs hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) to extract interstitial fluid (ISF), in a minimally invasive manner integrated with graphene oxide&#8208;nucleic acid (GO.NA)&#8208;based fluorescence biosensor to sense the biomarkers of interest in situ. The HMN&#8208;GO.NA assay is supplemented with a portable detector, enabling a complete POCT procedure. Our system could successfully measure four clinically important biomarkers (glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, and serotonin) ex vivo, in addition, to accurately detecting glucose and UA in vivo.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Pure Isotropic Proton Solid State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning on three&#8208;dimensional variable spinning rate datasets provides a powerful method to obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H two&#8208;dimensional NMR spectra in rigid organic solids by removing broadening due to dipolar interactions.







Abstract
One key bottleneck of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is that 1H NMR spectra of organic solids are often very broad due to the presence of a strong network of dipolar couplings. We have recently suggested a new approach to tackle this problem. More specifically, we parametrically mapped errors leading to residual dipolar broadening into a second dimension and removed them in a correlation experiment. In this way pure isotropic proton (PIP) spectra were obtained that contain only isotropic shifts and provide the highest 1H NMR resolution available today in rigid solids. Here, using a deep&#8208;learning method, we extend the PIP approach to a second dimension, and for samples of L&#8208;tyrosine hydrochloride and ampicillin we obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H double&#8208;quantum/single&#8208;quantum dipolar correlation and spin&#8208;diffusion spectra with significantly higher resolution than the corresponding spectra at 100&#8197;kHz MAS, allowing the identification of previously overlapped isotropic correlation peaks.

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in a Supported Copper/ZnO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of formation of alcohol&#8208;induced strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) on the surface of a Cu/ZnO catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in metal catalysts is a promising strategy to improve their catalytic performance. In this article, we systematically investigated the influences of different alcohol/water mixtures on the evolution of the interfacial structure of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the reduction stage. A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of alcohol induced SMSI. It was found that when methanol/water is added to H2 during the reduction pretreatment, more oxygen vacancies are formed on the ZnO support, which facilitates the dissociation of H2O and the hydroxylation of ZnO species. Such promotion eventually favors the SMSI between Cu and ZnO and increases the catalytic activity for the methanol steam reforming reaction. In contrast, the addition of ethanol/water and 1&#8208;propanol/water during reduction leads to a physical blockage of the catalyst by alcohol molecules, poisoning the active Cu sites and limiting the migration of ZnO species.

&lt;p&gt;A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of formation of alcohol-induced strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) on the surface of a Cu/ZnO catalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in metal catalysts is a promising strategy to improve their catalytic performance. In this article, we systematically investigated the influences of different alcohol/water mixtures on the evolution of the interfacial structure of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the reduction stage. A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of alcohol induced SMSI. It was found that when methanol/water is added to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during the reduction pretreatment, more oxygen vacancies are formed on the ZnO support, which facilitates the dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and the hydroxylation of ZnO species. Such promotion eventually favors the SMSI between Cu and ZnO and increases the catalytic activity for the methanol steam reforming reaction. In contrast, the addition of ethanol/water and 1-propanol/water during reduction leads to a physical blockage of the catalyst by alcohol molecules, poisoning the active Cu sites and limiting the migration of ZnO species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of 5&#8208;(Chloromethyl)furfural via Trienolate Intermediates</title>

         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF), an important biomass&#8208;derived platform chemical, with aldimines afford chiral amines in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The use of a bifunctional NHC bearing a free hydroxy group enabled the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine to occur in a highly stereocontrolled manner.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of the biomass&#8208;derived platform compound 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) with imines were developed. A series of high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral amines were afforded in good to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The bifunctional NHC derived from &#671;&#8208;pyroglutamic acid efficiently steered the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine in a highly stereocontrolled manner. This represents the first enantioselective reaction proceeding via an NHC&#8208;bound trienolate intermediate.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Induced Site&#8208;Specific Etching Boosts Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen (1O2) specifically targets the N&#8208;adjacent atoms and acts as an etchant to realize site&#8208;specific etching of topological carbon defects neighboring the N&#8208;dopants, leading to a boosted intrinsic catalytic activity of the N&#8722;C sites in the resultant N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8722;N/C). The 1O2&#8722;N/C exhibits the highest half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915&#8197;VRHE toward oxygen reduction reaction among all the metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
Targeted construction of carbon defects near the N dopants is an intriguing but challenging way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of N&#8208;doped carbon toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel site&#8208;specific etching strategy that features targeted anchoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) on the N&#8208;adjacent atoms to directionally construct topological carbon defects neighboring the N dopants in N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8722;N/C). This 1O2&#8722;N/C exhibits the highest ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915&#8197;VRHE among all the reported metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts. Pyridinic&#8208;N bonded with a carbon pentagon of the neighboring topological carbon defects is identified as the primary active configuration, rendering enhanced adsorption of O2, optimized adsorption energy of the ORR intermediates, and a significantly decreased total energy barrier for ORR. This 1O2&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific etching strategy is also applicable to different precursors, showing a tremendous potential for targeted construction of high&#8208;efficiency active sites in carbon&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Mechanochemical Approach for Air&#8208;Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium&#8208;Based Birch Reductions in Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical Birch reduction is reported for the first time. The newly developed ball&#8208;milling method does not require an inert atmosphere or other special precautions. Notably, the reaction completed within one minute for most of the investigated substrates. The present study thus provides a novel, operationally simple, rapid, and scalable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based Birch reduction.







Abstract
Birch reduction has been widely used in organic synthesis for over half a century as a powerful method to dearomatize arenes into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives. However, the conventional Birch reduction reaction using liquid ammonia requires laborious procedures to ensure inert conditions and low temperatures. Although several ammonia&#8208;free modifications have been reported, the development of an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable protocol remains a challenge. Herein, we report an ammonia&#8208;free lithium&#8208;based Birch reduction in air without special operating conditions using a ball&#8208;milling technique. This method is characterized by its operational simplicity and an extremely short reaction time (within 1&#8197;min), probably owing to the in situ mechanical activation of lithium metal, broad substrate scope, and no requirement for dry bulk solvents. The potential of our flash Birch reaction is also demonstrated by the efficient reduction of bioactive target molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for the Development of Recyclable Multifunctional Liquid Crystal Polymers via Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification and Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new synthetic strategy to combine the post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) and the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) for designing multifunctional linear liquid crystal polymers (LLCPs). A photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive LLCP is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to offer broader opportunities to structurally diversify LCPs.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) offers a versatile approach for engineering multifunctional polymers, but this advantage has not been fully exploited to fabricate multifunctional liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). Here, we design a facile synthetic approach towards multifunctional LCP by combining the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with PPM, in which ROMP helps to prepare a reactive LCP precursor with high molecular weight, and PPM provides a facilitation to introduce functional groups into the precursor. Consequently, a photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive linear LCP (LLCP) is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to diversify functions of the LCPs. Under light irradiation and humidity changes, the deformation modes of the LLCP films are converted to complex shapes (bending, twisting, and curling). The obtained dual&#8208;responsive LLCP with high molecular weight possesses excellent processability and recyclability, making it possible to construct 3D shape actuators with programmable deformation behaviors under light/humidity.

         <title>Stable Immobilization of Nickel Ions on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Panchromatic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking a stacked layered structure of a two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is achieved by solvothermal conditions to enable stable coordination with Ni(II) ions via the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine moiety. Such COF&#8208;Ni(II) complex exhibits an improved light absorption ability and boosts photocatalytic H2 generation (51,300 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) in a total visible spectrum, even under 700&#8208;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Post&#8208;coordination design on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an efficient strategy for elevating the photocatalytic activity of organic moiety. However, the rigid skeletons and densely layered stacking of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs cannot be flexibly adapted for specific conformations of metal complexes, thereby impairing the metal&#8208;COF cooperation. Here, we adopt a solvothermal method to immobilize nickel(II) ions into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing 2D COF, forming a stable coordination motif. Such the complex remarkably enhances the photocatalytic performance, giving an optimized H2 evolution rate of as high as 51&#8201;300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, 2.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine COF. The evolved hydrogen gas can also be detected upon 700&#8208;nm light irradiation, while its analog synthesized by the traditional coordination method is photo&#8208;catalytically inert. This work provides a strategy for optimizing the metal&#8208;COF coordination system and strengthening a synergy for electronic regulation in photocatalysis.

Such COF-Ni(II) complex exhibits an improved light absorption ability and boosts photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation (51,300 &#956;mol h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) in a total visible spectrum, even under 700-nm irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-coordination design on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an efficient strategy for elevating the photocatalytic activity of organic moiety. However, the rigid skeletons and densely layered stacking of two-dimensional (2D) COFs cannot be flexibly adapted for specific conformations of metal complexes, thereby impairing the metal-COF cooperation. Here, we adopt a solvothermal method to immobilize nickel(II) ions into a 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine-containing 2D COF, forming a stable coordination motif. Such the complex remarkably enhances the photocatalytic performance, giving an optimized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of as high as 51&#8201;300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.5&#8197;times higher than the pristine COF. The evolved hydrogen gas can also be detected upon 700-nm light irradiation, while its analog synthesized by the traditional coordination method is photo-catalytically inert. This work provides a strategy for optimizing the metal-COF coordination system and strengthening a synergy for electronic regulation in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Optimization of Photochemical Reactions using Segmented&#8208;Flow Nanoelectrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Segmented&#8208;flow mass spectrometry was used to enable the rapid screening of nanomole&#8208;scale photoredox reactions for drug discovery. Nanoelectrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry analysis was carried out at throughputs as high as 2.9&#8197;samples/s, allowing for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) evaluation of prepared analogues.







Abstract
Within the realm of drug discovery, high&#8208;throughput experimentation techniques enable the rapid optimization of reactions and expedited generation of drug compound libraries for biological and pharmacokinetic evaluation. Herein we report the development of a segmented flow mass spectrometry&#8208;based platform to enable the rapid exploration of photoredox reactions for early&#8208;stage drug discovery. Specifically, microwell plate&#8208;based photochemical reaction screens were reformatted to segmented flow format to enable delivery to nanoelectrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry analysis. This approach was demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds, as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship evaluation of synthesized analogs. This technology is anticipated to expand the robust capabilities of photoredox catalysis in drug discovery by enabling high&#8208;throughput library diversification.

         <title>Catalyst Control over Threefold Stereogenicity: Selective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Sulfones with Stereogenic C&#8722;S Axes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of catalyst control over threefold stereogenic C&#8722;S atropisomers is reported. A catalytic oxidation sequence of triptycyl thioethers via sulfoxides to sulfones with a stereogenic C(sp3)&#8722;S axis proceeds with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, while stereodivergence was possible to address each of the three atropisomers.







Abstract
Catalyst control over higher&#8208;order stereogenicity addresses significantly extended stereochemical space, but selective methods to govern threefold stereogenic units remained elusive. Herein, we report the stereoselective synthesis of threefold stereogenic triptycyl sulfones with atropisomerism arising from a C(sp3)&#8722;S bond. An oxidation of a stereodynamic thioether controlled by a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst allowed selective access to enantioenriched triptycyl sulfoxides. The ensuing enantiospecific and diastereoselective catalytic oxidation to a threefold stereogenic sulfone provided overall control over the stereogenic C&#8722;S axis. All three stereoisomers were addressable with enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergence and a stereoselectivity of up to (&#8722;sc):&#8201;(+sc)&#8201;:&#8201;(ap)=94&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8201;:&lt;1.

         <title>Driving Polymer Brushes from Synthesis to Functioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of facile and robust surface&#8208;initiated controlled radical polymerization strategies has encouraged researchers to fabricate well&#8208;defined polymer brushes under mild conditions. This review provides an overview of very recent advances in the architectural design of polymer brushes, which show new and very promising bioapplications such as biolubrication, antifouling and antibacterial coating, biosensing, and drug delivery.







Abstract
The great success of controlled radical polymerizations has encouraged researchers to develop more facile and robust approaches for surface&#8208;initiated polymerizations (SIPs) to fabricate polymer brushes, even for non&#8208;experts. In recent years, external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;mediated radical polymerization methods have come to the fore as SIPs because of their less rigorous synthetic procedures and high controllability, which expand the opportunities for synthesizing macromolecules with desired chemical compositions and structures, as well as tailor&#8208;made polymers and bioconjugates that show broad applicability and physiological compatibility. This review discusses the latest developments in surface&#8208;initiated polymerization methods, in particular, external&#8208;stimuli mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), photo&#8208;induced polymerizations, and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, as well as other methods and their combination for the application in surface grafting. The implementation of these methods is of great interest due to their unique possibilities to temporally control a polymerization process, fast and straightforward polymerization, and environmentally benign features, which lead to established and emerging applications in biolubrication, antifouling, and biosensing.

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Active Sites of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Selective Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quinone&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable onset potential of 0.83&#8197;eV vs. RHE in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and over 95&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the reverse verification method, compared with other oxygen functional groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via a two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process provides a promising alternative to replace the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. Herein, we develop a facile template&#8208;protected strategy to synthesize a highly active quinone&#8208;rich porous carbon catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical production. The optimized PCC900 material exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity, of which the onset potential reaches 0.83&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and the H2O2 selectivity is over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range. Comprehensive synchrotron&#8208;based near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy combined with electrocatalytic characterizations reveals the positive correlation between quinone content and 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performance. The effectiveness of chair&#8208;form quinone groups as the most efficient active sites is highlighted by the molecule&#8208;mimic strategy and theoretical analysis.

         <title>Morphological Profiling Identifies the Motor Protein Eg5 as Cellular Target of Spirooxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional group&#8208;controlled, RhIII&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles in combination with unbiased morphological bioactivity profiling reveal a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.







Abstract
Oxindoles and iso&#8208;oxindoles are natural product&#8208;derived scaffolds that provide inspiration for the design and synthesis of novel biologically relevant compound classes. Notably, the spirocyclic connection of oxindoles with iso&#8208;oxindoles has not been explored by nature but promises to provide structurally related compounds endowed with novel bioactivity. Therefore, methods for their efficient synthesis and the conclusive discovery of their cellular targets are highly desirable. We describe a selective RhIII&#8208;catalyzed scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles from differently protected diazooxindoles and N&#8208;pivaloyloxy aryl amides which includes a functional group&#8208;controlled Lossen rearrangement as key step. Unbiased morphological profiling of a corresponding compound collection in the Cell Painting assay efficiently identified the mitotic kinesin Eg5 as the cellular target of the spirooxindoles, defining a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxindoles and iso-oxindoles are natural product-derived scaffolds that provide inspiration for the design and synthesis of novel biologically relevant compound classes. Notably, the spirocyclic connection of oxindoles with &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-oxindoles has not been explored by nature but promises to provide structurally related compounds endowed with novel bioactivity. Therefore, methods for their efficient synthesis and the conclusive discovery of their cellular targets are highly desirable. We describe a selective Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed scaffold-divergent synthesis of spirooxindole&#8211;isooxindoles and spirooxindole&#8211;oxindoles from differently protected diazooxindoles and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-pivaloyloxy aryl amides which includes a functional group-controlled Lossen rearrangement as key step. Unbiased morphological profiling of a corresponding compound collection in the Cell Painting assay efficiently identified the mitotic kinesin Eg5 as the cellular target of the spirooxindoles, defining a unique Eg5 inhibitor chemotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monitoring the Reversibility of GPCR Signaling by Combining Photochromic Ligands with Label&#8208;free Impedance Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining photochromic agonists of GPCR receptors with label&#8208;free impedance analysis of cells expressing this receptor allows monitoring and controlling dynamics and reversibility of intracellular signaling cascades in real time.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled cell surface receptors (GPCR) trigger complex intracellular signaling cascades upon agonist binding. Classic pharmacological assays provide information about binding affinities, activation or blockade at different stages of the signaling cascade, but real time dynamics and reversibility of these processes remain often disguised. We show that combining photochromic NPY receptor ligands, which can be toggled in their receptor activation ability by irradiation with light of different wavelengths, with whole cell label&#8208;free impedance assays allows observing the cell response to receptor activation and its reversibility over time. The concept demonstrated on NPY receptors may be well applicable to many other GPCRs providing a deeper insight into the time course of intracellular signaling processes.

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Construction in Water Towards Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong&#8211;metal support interaction construction was induced via ultrasonication in water as described by Zhenzhen Yang, Sheng Dai et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202214322). The encapsulation degree of metal nanoparticles by reducible oxide overlayers can be modulated by the ultrasonication parameters. The facile tunability offers enhanced activity and selectivity in diverse hydrogenation catalytic applications. The cover picture by Kevin Siniard illustrates ultrasound waves encircling supported metal nanoparticles in water to induce the encapsulation procedure.

         <title>Complexes Featuring a cis&#8208;[M
U
M] Core (M=Rh, Ir): A New Route to Uranium&#8208;Metal Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes featuring two U
M double dative bonds are prepared from the reaction of heterometallic chlorine&#8208;bridged precursors with MeMgBr or MeLi. This study shows a novel synthetic method for complexes with U&#8722;M multiple bonds, and also provides new examples with which to investigate the bonding of 5&#8201;f&#8208;block actinide elements.







Abstract
Although examples of multiple bonds between actinide elements and main&#8208;group elements are quite common, studies of the multiple bonds between actinide elements and transition metals are extremely rare owing to difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here we report the first example of molecular uranium complexes featuring a cis&#8208;[M
U
M] core (M=Rh, Ir), which exhibits an unprecedented arrangement of two M
U double dative bond linkages to a single U center. These complexes were prepared by the reactions of chlorine&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{U{N(CH3)(CH2CH2NPiPr2)2}(Cl)2[(&#956;&#8208;Cl)M(COD)]2}] (M=Rh, Ir) with MeMgBr or MeLi, a new method for the construction of species with U&#8722;M multiple bonds. Theoretical calculations including dispersion confirmed the presence of two U
M double dative bonds in these complexes. This study not only enriches the U
M multiple bond chemistry, but also provides a new opportunity to explore the bonding of actinide elements.

         <title>Facile Access to Cyclopropylboronates via Stereospecific Deborylative Cyclization: A Leaving Group&#8208;Assisted Activation of Geminal Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy led to the efficient synthesis of racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal&#8208;bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective and stereospecific, tolerating various functional groups and heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicated that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.







Abstract
Herein we reported a transition metal&#8208;free deborylative cyclization strategy, based on which two routes have been developed, generating racemic and enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates. The cyclization of geminal&#8208;bis(boronates) bearing a leaving group was highly diastereoselective, tolerating a few functional groups and applicable to heterocycles. When optically active epoxides were used as the starting materials, enantioenriched cyclopropylboronates could be efficiently prepared with &gt;99&#8201;% stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies showed that the leaving group at the &#947;&#8208;position played a crucial role and significantly promoted the activation of the gem&#8208;diboron moiety.

         <title>Selective Preparation of Phosphorus Mononitride (P&#8801;N) from Phosphinoazide and Reversible Oxidation to Phosphinonitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An o&#8208;benzoquinone complex bearing a P&#8801;N unit displays reversible covalent&#8208;bond formation when exposed to green light in cryogenic matrices. This is the first demonstration of the reactivity of phosphorus mononitride towards an organic molecule.







Abstract
The interstellar candidate phosphorus mononitride PN, a metastable species, was generated through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis of (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide in cryogenic matrices. Although the PN stretching band was not directly detected because of its low infrared intensity and possible overlaps with other strong bands, o&#8208;benzoquinone, carbon monoxide, and cyclopentadienone as additional fragmentation products were clearly identified. Moreover, an elusive o&#8208;benzoquinone&#8208;PN complex formed when (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide was exposed to UV irradiation at &#955;=254&#8197;nm. Its recombination to (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinonitrile was observed upon irradiation with the light at &#955;=523&#8197;nm, which demonstrates for the first time the reactivity of PN towards an organic molecule. Energy profile computations at the B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP density functional theory level reveal a concerted mechanism. To provide further evidence, UV/Vis spectra of the precursor and the irradiation products were recorded and agree well with time&#8208;dependent DFT computations.

         <title>Cyclopentylmethyl Ether, a Non&#8208;Fluorinated, Weakly Solvating and Wide Temperature Solvent for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original molecular design is reported to tailor the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvents. Eliminating one O atom and increasing steric hinderance in DME leads to cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) with significantly weakened solvating power and well extended temperature range of liquid phase from &#8722;140&#8201;&#176;C and 106&#8201;&#176;C, showing a great prospect for wide temperature lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
While recent work demonstrates the advantages of weakly solvating solvents in enhancing the cyclability of LMBs, both new designs and design strategies for high performance weakly solvating solvent, especially physicochemical properties, are still lacking. Here, we propose a molecular design to tune the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvent. The resulting cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) have a weak solvating power and wide liquid&#8208;phase temperature range. By optimizing the salt concentration, the CE is further promoted to 99.4&#8201;%. Besides, the improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S battery in CPME&#8208;based electrolytes is obtained at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Li||LFP (17.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) battery with developed electrolyte maintains &gt;90&#8201;% of the original capacity over 400 cycles. Our design concept for solvent molecule provides a promising pathway to non&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with weakly solvating power and wide temperature window for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Heptagon&#8208;Containing Nanographene Embedded into [10]Cycloparaphenylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped heptagon&#8208;containing nanographene and a [10]cycloparaphenylene are merged into a single nanohoop. The intrinsic curvature of the nanographene diminishes the strain energy of the hoop, increases the binding constant and enables a fast electron transfer toward fullerenes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a novel type of nanohoop, consisting of a cycloparaphenylene derivative incorporating a curved heptagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) unit. We demonstrate that this new macrocycle behaves as a supramolecular receptor of curved &#960;&#8208;systems such as fullerenes C60 and C70, with remarkably large binding constants (ca. 107&#8197;M&#8722;1), as estimated by fluorescence measurements. Nanosecond and femtosecond spectroscopic analysis show that these host&#8208;guest complexes are capable of quasi&#8208;instantaneous charge separation upon photoexcitation, due to the ultrafast charge transfer from the macrocycle to the complexed fullerene. These results demonstrate saddle&#8208;shaped PAHs with dibenzocycloheptatrienone motifs as structural components for new macrocycles displaying molecular receptor abilities and versatile photochemical responses with promising electron&#8208;donor properties in host&#8208;guest complexes.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure and Dynamics of the Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclase for (&#8722;)&#8208;Ambroxide Production
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy in engineering the active site and entrance tunnel of squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase is demonstrated in the archetypal promiscuous cyclization of (E,E)&#8208;homofarnesol towards high&#8208;value (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide. Moreover, the long&#8208;term stability of the enzyme in vivo was exploited in a feeding strategy to demonstrate high cyclization performance.







Abstract
Terpene cyclases offer enormous synthetic potential, given their unique ability to forge complex hydrocarbon scaffolds from achiral precursors within a single cationic rearrangement cascade. Harnessing their synthetic power, however, has proved to be challenging owing to their generally low catalytic performance. In this study, we unveiled the catalytic potential of the squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase (SHC) by harnessing its structure and dynamics. First, we synergistically tailored the active site and entrance tunnel of the enzyme to generate a 397&#8208;fold improved (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide synthase. Our computational investigations explain how the introduced mutations work in concert to improve substrate acquisition, flow, and chaperoning. Kinetics, however, showed terpene&#8208;induced inactivation of the membrane&#8208;bound SHC to be the major turnover limitation in vivo. Merging this insight with the improved and stereoselective catalysis of the enzyme, we applied a feeding strategy to exceed 105 total turnovers. We believe that our results may bridge the gap for broader application of SHCs in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>A Direct Formaldehyde Fuel Cell for CO2&#8208;Emission Free Co&#8208;generation of Electrical Energy and Valuable Chemical/Hydrogen</title>

Highly selective 1&#8208;electron oxidation of formaldehyde enables co&#8208;generation of electricity and H2 with valuable formate in direct formaldehyde fuel cell without CO2 pathway, which not only avoid greenhouse gas emissions but also eliminate negative effects of CO poisoning and carbonate generation.







Abstract
Converting carbon&#8208;based molecular fuels into electricity efficiently and cleanly without emitting CO2 remains a challenge. Conventional fuel cells using noble metals as anode catalysts often suffer performance degradation due to CO poisoning and a host of problems associated with CO2 production. This study provides a CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free direct formaldehyde fuel cell. It enables a flow of electricity while producing H2 and valuable formate. Unlike conventional carbon&#8208;based molecules electrooxidation, formaldehyde 1&#8208;electron oxidation is performed on the Cu anode with high selectivity, thus generating formate and H2 without undergoing CO2 pathway. In addition, the fuel cell produces 0.62&#8197;Nm3 H2 and 53&#8197;mol formate per 1&#8197;kWh of electricity generated, with an open circuit voltage of up to 1&#8197;V and a peak power density of 350&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This study puts forward a zero&#8208;carbon solution for the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;based molecule fuels that generates electricity, hydrogen and valuable chemicals in synchronization.

Here, we show a versatile, general synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells (ZIF&#8208;zni, ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;67, FJU&#8208;30, MIL&#8208;88(Fe), HKUST&#8208;1, and MOF&#8208;74(Co)) and six cores (Ag, Au, NaYF4, &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, Fe2O3 and Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2) that are fine&#8208;tuned to incorporate from single to hundreds of cores in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) enjoy a vastly expanded application potential in catalysis, filtration, and sensing. The selection of particular modified core&#8208;NPs has yielded partial successes in overcoming lattice mismatch. However, restrictions on the choice of NPs not only limit the diversity, but also affect the properties of the hybrid materials. Here, we show a versatile synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells and six NP&#8208;cores that are fine&#8208;tuned to incorporate from single to hundreds of cores in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites. This method does not require the presence of any specific surface structures or functionalities on the pre&#8208;formed cores. Our key point is to regulate the diffusion rate of alkaline vapors that deprotonate organic linkers and trigger the controlled MOF&#8208;growth and encapsulation of NPs. This strategy is expected to pave the way for the exploration of more sophisticated MOF&#8208;nanohybrids.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Dendronized Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable luminescent radicals have been achieved by dendronization up to the fourth generation of tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radicals with carbazole groups. The emission blue&#8208;shifts from G2 (691&#8197;nm) to G4 (627&#8197;nm) as a result of reduced electron repulsion in the larger carbazole dendrons. The G4 dendrimer showed the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 63&#8201;% in cyclohexane solution.







Abstract
A series of carbazole&#8208;dendronized tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radicals have been synthesized. The photophysical properties of dendronized radicals up to the fourth generation were compared systematically to understand how structure&#8211;property relationships evolve with generation. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was found to increase with the increasing generation, and the fourth generation (G4TTM) in cyclohexane solution showed a PLQY as high as 63&#8201;% at a wavelength of 627&#8197;nm (in the deep&#8208;red region) from the doublet state. The dendron modification strategy also showed a blue&#8208;shift of the emission on increasing the generation number, and the photostability was also increased compared to the bare TTM radical.

         <title>A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some matrix chemicals used in MALDI mass spectrometry are not sufficiently vacuum&#8208;stable and therefore not suitable for extended MALDI imaging experiments. Caging the MALDI matrices by covalent attachment of a photocleavable group renders them vacuum&#8208;stable, as reported by Carsten Hopf et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202217047). The caged matrix is eventually uncaged in situ by the UV&#8208;laser in the MALDI ion source. Thereby, the original matrix is liberated, thus enabling MALDI imaging of large clinical or pharmacological sample cohorts.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy of Chiral Molecular Crystals: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a curious phenomenon that appears in various forms. While the concept of molecular (RS&#8208;)chirality is ubiquitous in chemistry, there are also more intricate forms of structural chirality. One of them is the enantiomorphism of crystals, especially molecular crystals, that describes the lack of mirror symmetry in the unit cell. Its relation to molecular chirality is not obvious, but still an open question, which can be addressed with chiroptical tools. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) denotes chiral IR&#8208;spectroscopy that is susceptible to both, the molecular as well as the intermolecular space by means of vibrational transitions. When carried out in the solid state, VCD delivers a very rich set of non&#8208;local contributions that are determined by crystal packing and collective motion. Since its discovery in the 1970s, VCD has become the method of choice for the determination of absolute configurations, but its applicability reaches beyond towards the study of different crystal forms and polymorphism. This brief review summarises the theoretical concepts of crystal chirality and how computations of solid&#8208;state VCD can shed light into the intimate connection of chiral structure and collective vibrations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, by choosing few&#8208;nm&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals of MOF&#8208;5 containing in&#8208;planner square lattices as a modular platform, a crystal lattice&#8208;guided wet&#8208;chemical etching has been rationally accomplished. As a result, two attractive pore patterns carrying Euclidean curvatures; precisely, plus(+)&#8208;shaped and fractal&#8208;patterned pores via &lt;100&gt; and &lt;110&gt; directional etching, respectively, are regulated in contrast to habitually formed spherical&#8208;shaped random etches on MOF surface. In agreement with the theoretical calculations, a diffusion&#8208;limited etching process has optimized devising high&#8208;yield of size&#8208;tunable fractal&#8208;pores on the MOF surface that tenders for a compatibly high payload of catalytic Re(I)&#8208;complexes using the existing large edge area once modified into free amine&#8208;group&#8208;exposed inner pore surface. Finally, on benefiting from the long&#8208;range fractal opening in 2D MOF support structure, while loaded on an electrode surface, a facilitated cross&#8208;interface charge&#8208;transportation and well&#8208;exposure of immobilized Re(I)&#8208;catalysts are anticipated, thus realizing enhanced activity and stability of the supported catalyst in photoelectrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional DNA Superstructures Exhibit Positive Homotropic Allostery in Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by intrinsically disordered proteins in nature, DNA aptamers can be engineered to display strongly homotropic allosteric (or cooperative) ligand binding, represents a unique feature that could be of great utility in applications such as biosensing, imaging and drug delivery. The use of intrinsic disorder mechanism, however, comes with an inherent drawback: the overall binding affinity is significantly reduced. We hypothesize that this issue could be addressed via the design of multivalent supramolecular aptamers. To confirm this idea, we engineered a DNA aptameric assembly, which we denote &#8220;functional DNA superstructures&#8221; (3D DNA). This functional 3D DNA is made of long chain DNA containing tandem repeating DNA aptamers (or concatemeric aptamers). We demonstrate that functional 3D DNA systems exhibit highly cooperative binding to both small molecules and proteins, without loss of binding affinities of their parent aptamers. We further use this to produce a highly responsive sensor for fluorescence imaging of glutamate stimulation&#8208;evoked adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in neurons, as well as force stimulus&#8208;triggered ATP release in astrocytes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Space&#8208;Confined Polymerization Templated by Ice Enables Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant progress in the preparation and characterization of many two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, the synthesis of 2D organic materials remains challenging. Here, we report a novel space&#8208;confined polymerization method that enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis of 2D sheets of a functional conjugated polymer, namely, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A key step in this method is the confinement of monomer to the boundaries of ice crystals using micelles. This spatial confinement directs the polymerization to form 2D PEDOT sheets with high crystallinity and controlled morphology. Supercapacitors prepared from the 2D PEDOT sheets exhibit outstanding performance metrics. In aqueous electrolyte, a high areal specific capacitance of 898 mF cm&#8208;2 at 0.2 mA cm&#8208;2 along with an excellent rate capability is achieved (e.g., capacitance retention of 67.6% at a 50&#8208;fold higher current). Moreover, the 2D PEDOT&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.5% after 30,000 cycles). Device performance is further improved when an organic electrolyte is used.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Crystal Phase to Form MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel for Highly Efficient Syngas to Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide&#8208;Zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept has been demonstrated in an increasing number of studies to provide an alternative avenue for direct syngas conversion to light olefins. We herein report that face centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel gives 40% CO conversion, 81% light olefins selectivity, and 0.17 g&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 space&#8208;time yield of light olefins in combination with SAPO&#8208;18. In comparison, solid solution MnGaOx (characterized by Mn&#8208;doped hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) Ga2O3) with a similar chemical composition gives a much inferior activity, i.e., the specific surface activity is one order of magnitude lower than the spinel oxide. Photoluminescence (PL), in situ fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate that the superior activity of MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel can be attributed to its higher reducibility (higher concentration of oxygen vacancies) and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ site, which facilitates the dissociation of the C&#8208;O bond via a more efficient ketene&#8208;acetate pathway to light olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving&#160;Macroporosity&#160;in Type III&#160;Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preserving large permanent pore structures in a fluid may endow conventional liquids with emergent physical properties. However, such materials are challenging to make because of the tendency of the pores being filled and occupied by the solvent molecules. Here, we report the design and synthesis of the first Type III porous liquid (PL) containing uniform yet stable 480 nm cavities. &#160;This was achieved by first constructing a single crystalline hollow metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, through chemical etching. The thin yet defect&#8208;free MOF shell effectively excluded the bulky poly(dimethylsiloxane) solvent molecules outside the cavity through its 4 &#197; aperture, resulting in the preservation of both micro&#8208; and macroporosity in the PL. These enormous void spaces allow the PL to reversibly host and release up to 27 wt% water for up to 10 cycles. The switching between the &#8220;dry&#8221; state and the &#8220;wet&#8221; state led to a drastic change of the thermal conductivity of the PL from 0.140 to 0.256 W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;1, affording a guest responsive liquid thermal switch with a switching ratio of 1.8.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolutionary Algorithm Directed Synthesis of Mixed Anion Compounds LaF2X (X = Br, I) and LaFI2.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;anion compounds have attracted growing attentions, but their synthesis is challenging, making a rational search desirable. Here, we explored LaF3&#8208;LaX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) system using ab initio structure searches based on evolutionary algorithms, and predicted LaF2X and LaFX2 (X = Br, I), which are respectively isostructural with LaHBr2 and YH2I, consisting of layered La&#8208;F blocks with single and double ordered honeycomb lattices, separated by van der Waals gaps. We successfully synthesized these compounds: LaF2Br and LaFI2 crystallized in the predicted structure, while LaF2I is similar to the predicted one but with different layer stacking. LaF2I exhibits fluoride ion conductivity comparable to that of non&#8208;doped LaF3, and has the potential to show better ionic conductivity upon appropriate doping, given the theoretically lower diffusion energy barrier and the presence of soft iodine anions. This study shows the structure prediction using evolutionary algorithms will accelerate the discovery of mixed&#8208;anion compounds in future, in particular those with an ordered anion arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Absorbing B,N&#8208;Heteroarene as Photosensitizer for High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers is highly desirable for a variety of emerging applications. However, the development of NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC with a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift is extremely challenging because of the energy loss during the intersystem crossing (ISC). Here, we develop the first NIR&#8208;absorbing B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based sensitizer (BNS) with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters to achieve efficient NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC. The small energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states (0.14 eV) of BNS suppresses the ISC energy loss, and its long&#8208;delayed fluorescence lifetime (115 &#956;s) contributes to efficient triplet energy transfer. As a result, the largest anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03 eV) among all heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;activatable TTA&#8208;UC systems is obtained with a high TTA&#8208;UC quantum yield of 2.9% (upper limit 50%).</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Interphase with Target&#8208;Distributed Desolvation Sites and Directionally Depositional Ion Flux for Sustainable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) feature high safety and low cost, but intricate anodic side reactions and dendrite growth severely restrict their commercialization. Herein, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) grafted metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;E) is proposed as a dually&#8208;functional anodic interphase for sustainable Zn anode. Specifically, the target&#8208;distributed EDTA serves as ion&#8208;trapped tentacles to accelerate the desolvation and ionic transport by powerful chemical coordination, while the MOF offers suitable ionic channels to induce oriented deposition. As a result, MOF&#8208;E interphase fundamentally suppresses side reactions and guides horizontally arranged Zn deposition with (002) preferred orientations. The Zn|MOF&#8208;E@Cu cell exhibits a markedly improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles, and the MOF&#8208;E@Zn|KVOH (KV12O30&#8208;y&#183;nH2O) cell yields a steady circulation of 5000 cycles@90.47% at 8 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Formyl Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketones are among the most useful functional groups in organic synthesis, and they are commonly encountered in a broad range of compounds with various applications. Herein, we describe the mesoionic carbene&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of aldehydes with non&#8208;activated secondary and even primary alkyl halides. This metal&#8208;free method utilizes deprotonated Breslow intermediates derived from mesoionic carbenes (MICs), which act as super electron donors and induce the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkyl halides. This mild coupling reaction has a broad substrate scope and tolerates many functional groups, which allows to prepare a diversity of simple ketones as well as bio&#8208;active molecules by late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe the mesoionic carbene-catalyzed coupling reaction of aldehydes with non-activated secondary and even primary alkyl halides. This metal-free method utilizes deprotonated Breslow intermediates derived from mesoionic carbenes (MICs), which act as super electron donors and induce the single-electron reduction of alkyl halides. This mild coupling reaction has a broad substrate scope and tolerates many functional groups, which allows to prepare a diversity of simple ketones as well as bio-active molecules by late-stage functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Monomer Design Synergizing Property Trade&#8208;offs in Developing Polymers for Circularity and Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current search for more sustainable plastics seeks to redesign polymers possessing both chemical recyclability to monomer for a circular plastics economy and desirable performance that can rival or even exceed today&#8217;s non&#8208;recyclable or hard&#8208;torecycle petroleum&#8208;based incumbents. However, within a traditional monomer framework it is challenging to optimize, concurrently, contrasting polymerizability/depolymerizability and recyclability/performance properties. Here, we highlight the emerging hybrid monomer design strategy to develop intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties, aiming to unify desired, but otherwise conflicting, properties in a single monomer. Conceptually, this design hybridizes parent monomer pairs of contrasting, mismatching, or matching properties into offspring monomers that not only unify the above&#8208;described conflicting properties but also radically alter the resultant polymer properties far beyond the limits of what either parent homopolymers or their copolymers can achieve.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of N&#8209;heterocyclic diazoolefins is described. The products of these formal (3+3) cycloaddition reactions are strongly reducing quinoidal tetrazines.

The latter are also accessible by oxidative dimerization of diazoolefins.</dc:description>

Herein, we report an efficient kinetic resolution of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams via a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric boron conjugate addition, which also leads to the efficient synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbon centers. The kinetic resolution proceeded smoothly with a wide range of &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituted substrates including those bearing aromatic heterocycles and different N&#8208;protected substrates in up to 347 of s value. Their highly versatile transformations, synthetic utility in biologically active molecules, and inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cell A2780 have also been demonstrated. Differing from the well&#8208;known mechanism involving Cu&#8208;B species in Cu&#8208;catalyzed boron conjugate additions, our mechanistic studies using DFT calculations and experiments indicate that a Lewis acid Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed mechanism is the likely pathway in the catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Colloidal Assembly Behavior Enables Printable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple quantum wells (QWs) distribution in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films hinders charge transport due to the fundamental difficulty of controlling crystal growth from precursor solutions, yielding poorly homogeneous low&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially in upscaling fabrication. Here, efficient low&#8208;dimensional PSCs are realized by modulating the colloidal assembly behavior in the precursor solution to induce intermediate structures. In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved lead iodide&#8208;dominated colloidal soft framework is visualized by investigating the precursor species differences under hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, solid&#8208;state reactions emerge and the formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite films exhibit significantly suppressed multiple QWs distribution. Encouragingly, the FA device (n = 9, by meniscus&#8208;assisted coating) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.28% for a size of 0.04 cm2 and a PCE of 15.35% for a mini&#8208;module of 16.94 cm2 with superior stability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The multiple quantum wells (QWs) distribution in low-dimensional perovskite films hinders charge transport due to the fundamental difficulty of controlling crystal growth from precursor solutions, yielding poorly homogeneous low-dimensional perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially in upscaling fabrication. Here, efficient low-dimensional PSCs are realized by modulating the colloidal assembly behavior in the precursor solution to induce intermediate structures. In combination with in situ liquid time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved lead iodide-dominated colloidal soft framework is visualized by investigating the precursor species differences under hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, solid-state reactions emerge and the formamidine (FA)-based perovskite films exhibit significantly suppressed multiple QWs distribution.

         <title>Realizing Abundant Chirality Inversion of Supramolecular Nanohelices by Multiply Manipulating the Binding Sites in Molecular Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple binding sites of biomolecules induced diverse chirality regulation is ubiquitous in nature and play an essential role in determining the biofunction of biosystems. However, mimicking this biological phenomenon and understand its mechanism from multiple binding sites at molecular level by establishing an artificial system still remains a challenge. Herein, the abundant chirality inversion is achieved by precisely and multiply manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives (D/LPPF) with different naphthalene derivatives (NA, NC, NP, NF). The amide and hydroxyl group of naphthalene derivatives prefer to bind with carboxyl of LPPF, while carboxylic and fluoride atom tend to bind with amide of LPPF. All these diverse interaction modes can precisely trigger the helicity inversion of LPPF nanofibers. In addition, synergistically manipulating the carboxyl and amide binding sites from a single LPPF molecule to simultaneously interact with different naphthalene derivatives is realized for chirality regulation. Typically, the variation of solvent may switch the interaction modes and the switched new interaction modes can be employed to further regulate the chirality of LPPF nanofibers. This study may provide a novel approach to explore the chirality diversity in artificial systems by regulating the intermolecular binding sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Detection of Trace Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indoor detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration is necessary due to the serious toxicity hazards&#160;even at trace level. However, physisorbents usually exhibit weak interactions especially in the presence of trace concentrations of VOCs, thus exhibiting poor responsive signal. Herein, we report a new flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that exhibits interesting pore&#8208;opening behavior after immersing in H2O. The pore&#8208;opening phase shows significant (~116 folds) and extremely fast (&lt; 1 minute) fluorescence enhancement&#160;after being exposed to saturated benzene vapor. The limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor can be calculated as 0.133 mg L&#8208;1. Thus this material represents the first MOF to achieve visual detection of trace benzene vapor by the naked eyes. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure reveal that the special "bilateral &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking" interactions between the host and guest, which facilitate electron transfer and greatly enhance the intensity of fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioethers as Dichotomous Electrophiles for Site&#8208;Selective Silylation via C&#8208;S Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of aryl alkyl sulfides as dichotomous electrophiles for site&#8208;selective silylation via C&#8208;S bond cleavage has been achieved. Iron&#8208;catalyzed selective cleavage of C(aryl)&#8208;S bonds can occur in the presence of &#946;&#8208;diketimine ligands, and the cleavage of C(alkyl)&#8208;S bonds can be achieved by t&#8208;BuONa without the use of transition metals, resulting in the corresponding silylated products in moderate to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that Fe&#8208;Si species may undergo metathesis reactions during the cleavage of C(aryl)&#8208;S bonds, while silyl radicals are involved during the cleavage of C(alkyl)&#8208;S bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Approach to Solution&#8208;Processible Small&#8208;Molecule Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters  for High &#8208;Performance Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most multi&#8208;resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters generally exhibit strong aggregation and relatively worse solubility due to their rigid and planar molecule structures, which is highly undesirable for solution&#8208;processible devices. Herein, a simple but feasible approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule MR&#8208;TADF emitters is developed by incorporating two MR&#8208;TADF units onto carbazole bridge bearing long alkyl chains. The obtained emitters demonstrate supreme film&#8208;forming capability and narrowband emissions with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 22 nm. The resulting solution&#8208;processed narrowband electroluminescent devices achieve maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.1%, which represents the highest efficiency among the solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters. This simple approach reveals great potential of developing solution&#8208;processible emitters for rigid and planar molecular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfenate Anion Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aziridines are highly valued synthetic targets in organic and medicinal chemistry. The organocatalytic synthesis of such structures with broad substrate scope and good diastereoselectivity, however, is rare. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and diastereoselective synthetic method for the synthesis of trans&#8208;aziridines from imines and benzylic or alkyl halides utilizing sulfenate anions (PhSO&#8211;) as the catalyst. Substrates bearing heterocyclic aromatic groups, alkyl, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl groups were shown to be compatible with this method (33 examples), giving good yields and high diastereoselectivity (trans: cis &gt; 20:1). Further functionalization of aziridines containing cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl groups was achieved through ring&#8208;opening reactions, with a cyclobutyl&#8208;substituted norephedrine derivative obtained through a four&#8208;step synthesis. We offer a mechanistic proposal involving reversible addition of the deprotonated benzyl sulfoxide to the imine to explain the high trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Linker Dimensionality in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Control for Separation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with high surface areas, which are acquiring rapid attention on an exponential basis. A significant characteristic of MOFs is their ability to act as adsorbents to selectively separate component mixtures of similar size, thereby addressing the technological need for an alternative approach to conventional distillation methods. Recently, MOFs comprising a 3&#8208;Dimensional (3D) linker have shown outstanding capabilities for difficult separations compared to the parent 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) analogue. 3D&#8208;linkers with a polycyclic core are underrepresented in the MOF database due to the widespread preferred use of 2D&#8208;linkers and the misconceived high&#8208;cost of 3D linkers. We summarize the recent research of 3D&#8208;linker MOFs and highlight their beneficial employment for selective gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation. Furthermore, we outline forecasts in this area to create a platform for widespread adoption of 3D&#8208;linkers in MOF synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials could revolutionize batteries because of their high energy densities, the use of Earth&#8208;abundant elements, and structural diversity, which allows fine&#8208;tuning of electrochemical properties. However, small organic molecules and intermediates formed during their redox cycling in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have high solubility in organic electrolytes, leading to rapid decay of cycling performance. We report the use of three cyclotetrabenzil octaketone macrocycles as cathode materials for LIBs. The rigid and insoluble naphthalene&#8208;based cyclotetrabenzil reversibly accepts eight electrons in a two&#8208;step process with a specific capacity of 279 mAh g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance with ~65% capacity retention after 135 cycles. DFT calculations indicate that its reduction increases both ring strain and ring rigidity, as demonstrated by computed high distortion energies, repulsive regions in NCI plots, and close [C&#183;&#183;&#183;C] contacts between the naphthalenes. This work highlights the importance of shape&#8208;persistency and ring strain in the design of redox&#8208;active macrocycles that maintain very low solubility in various redox states.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanobody Loop Mimetics Enhance Son of Sevenless 1&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleotide Exchange on RAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAS proteins control various intracellular signaling networks. Mutations at specific locations were shown to stabilize their active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)&#8208;bound state, which is associated with the development of multiple cancers. An attractive approach to modulate RAS signaling is through its regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). With the recent discovery of Nanobody14 (Nb14), which potently enhances SOS1&#8208;catalyzed nucleotide exchange on RAS, we explored the feasibility of developing peptide mimetics by structurally mimicking the complementarity&#8208;determining region 3 (CDR3). Guided by a biochemical GEF assay and X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures, successive rounds of optimization and gradual conformational rigidification led to CDR3 mimetics showing half of the maximal activation potential of Nb14 with an EC50 value of 29 &#956;M. Altogether, this study demonstrated that peptides able to modulate a protein&#8208;protein interaction can be obtained by structural mimicry of a Nb paratope.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Carbon&#8208;Sequestrated Seawater into Stoichiometric CO and HClO with Nitrogen&#8208;Doped BiOCl Atomic Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater is one of the most important CO2 sequestration media for delivering value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels and active chlorine; however, this scenario is plagued by sluggish reaction rates and poor product selectivity. Herein, we first report the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers to directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater (Yellow Sea, China) into stoichiometric CO (92.8 &#181;mol h&#8208;1) and HClO (83.2 &#181;mol h&#8208;1) under visible light with selectivities greater than 90%. Photoelectrons enriched on the exposed BiOCl{001} facet kinetically facilitate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction via surface&#8208;doped nitrogen bearing Lewis basicity. Photoholes, mainly located on the lateral facets of van der Waals gaps, promote the selective oxidation of Cl&#8208; into HClO. Sequestrated CO2 also maintains the pH of seawater at around 4.2 to prevent the alkaline earth cations from precipitating. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships, offering a green and safe way for onsite sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Oxidative Degradation Mechanism of Solid Amine Sorbents for CO2 Capture from Air: Roles of Atmospheric Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct air capture (DAC) processes for extraction of CO2 from ambient air are unique among chemical processes in that they operate outdoors conditions with minimal feed pretreatments. Here, the impact of humidity on the oxidative degradation of a prototypical solid supported amine sorbent, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on Al2O3, is explored in detail. By combining CO2 adsorption measurements, oxidative degradation rates, elemental analyses, solid&#8208;state NMR and in situ IR spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with 18O labeling of water, a comprehensive picture of sorbent oxidation is achieved under accelerated conditions. We demonstrated that the presence of water vapor can play an important role in accelerating the degradation reactions. From the study we inferred the identity and kinetics of formation of the major oxidative products, and the role(s) of humidity. Our data are consistent with a radical mediated autooxidative degradation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Active Cu2O/Copper Interface Sites for N&#8208;Formylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines with CO2/H2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;formylation of aliphatic primary amines with CO2/H2 to formamide is achieved with a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal Cu&#8208;based catalyst containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites.







Abstract
Heterogeneously catalyzed N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamide with CO2/H2 is highly attractive for the valorization of CO2. However, the relationship of the catalytic performance with the catalyst structure is still elusive. Herein, mixed valence catalysts containing Cu2O/Cu interface sites were constructed for this transformation. Both aliphatic primary and secondary amines with diverse structures were efficiently converted into the desired formamides with good to excellent yields. Combined ex and in situ catalyst characterization revealed that the presence of Cu2O/Cu interface sites was vital for the excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that better catalytic activity of Cu2O/Cu(111) than Cu(111) is attributed to the assistance of oxygen at the Cu2O/Cu interface (Ointer) in formation of Ointer&#8208;H moieties, which not only reduce the apparent barrier of HCOOH formation but also benefit the desorption of the desired N&#8208;formylated amine, leading to high activity and selectivity.

         <title>A Fluid Multivalent Magnetic Interface for High&#8208;Performance Isolation and Proteomic Profiling of Tumor&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluid multivalent magnetic interface was engineered in a microfluidic chip to improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition for efficient isolation of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs). With the assistance of magnetic and flow fields, this interface balanced affinity, selectivity, reversibility, and extendibility, enabling high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for protein profiling.







Abstract
Isolation and analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (T&#8208;EVs) are important for clinical cancer management. Here, we develop a fluid multivalent magnetic interface (FluidmagFace) in a microfluidic chip for high&#8208;performance isolation, release, and protein profiling of T&#8208;EVs. The FluidmagFace increases affinity by 105&#8208;fold with fluidity&#8208;enhanced multivalent binding to improve isolation efficiency by 13.9&#8201;% compared with a non&#8208;fluid interface. Its anti&#8208;adsorption property and microfluidic hydrodynamic shear minimize contamination, increasing detection sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its reversibility and expandability allow high&#8208;throughput recovery of T&#8208;EVs for mass spectrometric protein analysis. With the chip, T&#8208;EVs were detected in all tested cancer samples with identification of differentially expressed proteins compared with healthy controls. The FluidmagFace opens a new avenue to isolation and release of targets for cancer diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Reaction of Metal&#8208;Polarized Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzoxazinones with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides were developed under transition metal catalysis. Pharmaceutically significant bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, benzimidazolines and dibenzodiazepines, were produced with high efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, detailed mechanism studies were carried out to explain the proposed mechanism and reaction selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs) are a unique and efficient handle for azaheterocycle synthesis. Despite great achievements, the potential of these reactive intermediates has not yet been fully exploited, especially the new reaction modes. Herein, we disclosed an unprecedented dearomatization process of metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs, affording transient dearomatized spiroaziridine intermediates. Based on this serendipity, we accomplished three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzimidazolines with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides, enabling the divergent synthesis of bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles with high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to explain the proposed mechanisms and observed selectivity. Further cellular evaluation of the dibenzodiazepine products identified a hit compound for new antitumor drugs.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Azulene&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Knoevenagel&#8208;Type Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and modular method has been developed for the construction of novel azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with good structure versatility. The chemical structures, aromaticity, and photophysical properties of the synthesized non&#8208;alternant PAHs are fully investigated. This strategy provides straightforward access and rapid construction of unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs, and possibly graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.







Abstract
The research interest in azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has significantly increased recently, but the lack of efficient synthetic strategies impedes the investigation of their structure&#8208;property relationships and further opto&#8208;electronic applications. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy towards diverse azulene&#8208;embedded PAHs by a tandem Suzuki coupling and base&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel&#8208;type condensation with good yields and great structural versatility, including non&#8208;alternant thiophene&#8208;rich PAHs, butterfly&#8208; or Z&#8208;shaped PAHs bearing two azulene units, and the first example of a two&#8208;azulene&#8208;embedded double [5]helicene. The structural topology, aromaticity and photophysical properties were investigated by NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy assisted by DFT calculations. This strategy provides a new platform for rapidly synthesizing unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs or even graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbons in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) are promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts due to their low cost, tunable catalytic activity and selectivity, and well&#8208;dispersed morphologies. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of such systems, it is critical to gain a detailed understanding of their structure and properties through advanced characterization. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) serves as a powerful tool to probe both the active sites and structural evolution of catalytic materials under reaction conditions. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of XAS and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Interaction between Divalent Copper Fluoride and Carboxamide Group Enabling Stereoretentive Fluorination of Tertiary Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination reaction allowed to achieve the synthesis of molecules bearing F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Based on the use of enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;halocarboxamides and inexpensive CsF, the reaction could be controlled by efficient divalent&#8208;Cu/carboxamide interactions. This new methodology enables to generate the tert&#8208;alkyl fluorides in a stereoretentive manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination involving CsF and &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as tertiary alkyl sources that, unlike traditional stereospecific routes involving stereoinversive SN2 reactions, proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. The developed stereospecific Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction is among the most efficient methods for synthesizing fluorinated molecules that possess highly congested stereogenic carbon centers. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combined reactivity of CuF2 and Cs salt is essential for completing the catalytic cycle. Our catalytic system underwent fluorination exclusively with tertiary alkyl bromides and did not react with primary alkyl bromides, indicating that this stereospecific fluorination methodology is suitable for synthesizing fluorinated building blocks possessing stereo&#8208;defined F&#8208;containing tertiary carbon stereogenic center.

         <title>Optochemical Control of mRNA Translation in Eukaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optochemically controlled biomolecules are a rapidly growing field that holds enormous promise for biological and therapeutic research. The growing need for therapeutic oligonucleotides and the recent success of mRNA as a therapeutic modality highlight the requirement for highly precise spatial and temporal regulation of nucleic acid activities at the post&#8208;transcriptional level.







Abstract
A major stage in the expression of genes is the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), and the regulation of this process is essential for protein production in cells. How tightly controlled gene expression can be spatially and temporally, is particularly evident in polar cells and embryonic development. We need tools to dissect these complex processes, if we wish to understand the underlying links, especially the difficulties brought on by malfunction. External bioorthogonal triggers are very helpful in this area, if they let us precisely control where and when a process is started. Equipping nucleic acids with light&#8208;responsive groups has proven to be an effective approach to examine the dynamic regulatory route of mRNA translation in living cells. In this review, we present an overview of the most recent methods for optochemically controlling translation, focusing on cis&#8208;acting technologies.

         <title>Origin of Surface Reconstruction in Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism Based&#8208;Transition Metal Oxides: A Spontaneous Chemical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface reconstruction of Lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based metal oxides in alkaline medium was unveiled to be triggered by a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the activated lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules firstly, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;). Then, the metal&#8208;site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen&#8208;deficient surface.







Abstract
A fundamental understanding of surface reconstruction process is pivotal to developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is believed as an irreversible oxygen redox behavior, due to the much slower rate of OH&#8722; refilling than that of oxygen vacancy formation.

     alt="Origin of Surface Reconstruction in Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism Based-Transition Metal Oxides: A Spontaneous Chemical Process"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface reconstruction of Lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)-based metal oxides in alkaline medium was unveiled to be triggered by a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the activated lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules firstly, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Then, the metal-site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen-deficient surface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental understanding of surface reconstruction process is pivotal to developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is believed as an irreversible oxygen redox behavior, due to the much slower rate of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; refilling than that of oxygen vacancy formation. Here, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM based metal oxides is a spontaneous chemical reaction process, instead of an electrochemical reaction process. During the chemical process, the lattice oxygen atoms were attacked by adsorbed water molecules, leading to the formation of hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Subsequently, the metal-site soluble atoms leached from the oxygen-deficient surface. This work also suggests that the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity could accelerate the surface reconstruction process. Hence, such a finding could add a new layer for the understanding of surface reconstruction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydroxyacid Potassium Synergists as an Efficient In Situ Defect Passivator for High Performance Tin&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO2 electron transport layers have attracted extensive research due to their compelling photovoltaic performance. Herein, we presented an in situ passivation of SnO2 with low&#8208;cost hydroxyacid potassium synergist during deposition to optimize interface carrier extraction and transport&#160;of PSCs for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stabilities. The orbital overlap of the carboxyl oxygen with the Sn atom alongwith the nano particle depositon effectively suppresses the interfacial defects and releases the internal residual strains in the perovskite. Accordingly, a PCE of 24.91% and fill factor (FF) up to 0.852 of in situ passivated devices are obtained, which is one of the highest values for SnO2&#8208;based&#160;PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained 80% of its initial PCE at 80&#176;C over 600h, 100% PCE after aging at ambient conditions for 1300h, and 98% after one week under maximum&#160;power point tracking (MPPT) of continuous AM1.5G illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Organic&#8208;Cation Defects on Optoelectronic Properties of ASnI3 Perovskites A=HC(NH2)2, CH3NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve higher power conversion efficiency for tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites the critical role of organic defects in nonradiative recombination should be better understood. Random rotation of organic cation can suppress nonradiative carrier trapping owing to organic defects in FASnI3 [FA=HC(NH2)2], rendering the organic contributions for defect tolerance. In contrast, organic defects in MASnI3 (MA=CH3NH3) are strong and active trapping centers.







Abstract
Tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14&#8201;%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA [HC(NH2)2] in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;15&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Amides Enabled by 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Bipyridine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mere introduction of a CF3 group at position&#8197;5 of a bipyridine ligand promotes a dramatic change in regioselectivity in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of benzamides and derivatives, from meta/para to ortho&#8208;substitution. Computational and experimental data suggest that this effect is associated with unusual outer&#8208;sphere dispersion interactions between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;bipy ring of the ligand.







Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds are highly attractive transformations because of the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of meta and/or para positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF3 substituent at position&#8197;5, enables a complete change of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, allowing the synthesis of a wide variety of ortho&#8208;borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer&#8208;sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the introduction of enzyme&#8208;responsive units in aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), enzyme&#8208;activatable SNAs can be constructed to mediate the connection between an enzyme biomarker and proteins of interest (POI) and enable cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective POI capture and translocation regulation. The enzyme&#8208;control strategy is expandable to regulate diverse POI with flexible aptamer design.







Abstract
Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect the function of the protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but there is a lack of suitable methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring conjugated polymer is developed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of polythiophene backbone. The resultant polymer shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels and highly ordered crystallite structure, leading to excellent thermoelectric performance after n&#8208;doping.







Abstract
Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8722;3.91&#8197;eV/&#8722;6.22&#8197;eV, high electron mobility of 0.39&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>Pretrichodermamide A Biosynthesis Reveals the Hidden Diversity of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic route of fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) was revealed by elucidating the biosynthesis of pretrichodermamide A. Diverse ETP derivatives, including 25 novel compounds, were characterized from tda gene deletion mutants, indicating divergent metabolic pathways of ETP intermediates and enzyme catalytic promiscuity.







Abstract
Fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) possess large structural diversity and complexity due to modifications of the cyclodipeptide skeleton. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pretrichodermamide A (1) in Trichoderma hypoxylon revealed a flexible catalytic machinery of multiple enzymes for generating ETP diversity. Seven tailoring enzymes encoded by the tda cluster are involved in 1 biosynthesis, that is, four P450s TdaB and TdaQ for 1,2&#8208;oxazine formation, TdaI for C7&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation, and TdaG for C4, C5&#8208;epoxidation, two methyltransferases TdaH for C6&#8242;&#8208; and TdaO for C7&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation, and a reductase TdaD for furan opening. Gene deletions led to the identification of 25 novel ETPs, including 20 shunt products, indicating the catalytic promiscuity of Tda enzymes. Particularly, TdaG and TdaD accept various substrates and catalyze regiospecific reactions at different stages of 1 biosynthesis. Our study not only uncovers a hidden library of ETP alkaloids, but also helps to understand the hidden chemical diversity of natural products by pathway manipulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioselective benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones have been developed. The reaction proceeds via a high ordered sequence of imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;aza shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step.







Abstract
An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.

         <title>Somalactams A&#8211;D: Anti&#8208;inflammatory Macrolide Lactams with Unique Ring Systems from an Arctic Actinomycete Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new macrolide lactams, which were biosynthesized by a novel gene cluster sml, were isolated from an Arctic actinomycete strain. Multiple structural elucidation approaches were integrated to determine their structures. One of the compounds was found to inhibit IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It inhibited the MAPK pathway and significantly protected zebrafish from LPS&#8208;induced inflammation.







Abstract
Four new PKS&#8208;NRPS&#8208;derived macrolide lactams with three unique ring fusion types were discovered from the Arctic sponge associated actinomycete Streptomyces somaliensis 1107 using a genome mining strategy. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of MS, NMR spectroscopic analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Biosynthetically, a novel gene cluster sml consisting of three polyketide synthases and one hybrid polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase together with cytochrome P450s and flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenases and oxidoreductases was demonstrated to assemble the unique skeleton. Pharmacological studies revealed that compound 1 displayed a potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity. It inhibited IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 0.18&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, and modulated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, compound 1 alleviated LPS&#8208;induced systemic inflammation in our transgenic fluorescent zebrafish model.

         <title>Molecular Lanthanide Switches for Magnetism and Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common organic donor solvent tetrahydrofuran readily replaces the labile cyclononatetraenyl anion from the coordination sphere of trivalent lanthanide ions. Accordingly, [(C9H9)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)] sandwich complexes reversibly form [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)][(C9H9)] species upon solvent coordination. Depending on the complexed lanthanide ion, this drastic modulation of the coordination environment can be exploited to switch the photoluminescence properties (Ce, Tb) or magnetic behaviour (Nd, Er) of the parent complex.







Abstract
Solvation of [(CNT)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd, Tb, Er; CNT=cyclononatetraenyl, i.e., C9H9&#8722;; COT=cyclooctatetraendiid, i.e., C8H82&#8722;) complexes with tetrahydrofuran (THF) gives rise to neutral [(&#951;4&#8208;CNT)Ln(thf)2(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce) and ionic [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;COT)][CNT] (x=4 (Ce, Nd, Tb), 3 (Er)) species in a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single&#8208;molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self&#8208;sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.

&lt;p&gt;The common organic donor solvent tetrahydrofuran readily replaces the labile cyclononatetraenyl anion from the coordination sphere of trivalent lanthanide ions. Accordingly, [(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)Ln(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)] sandwich complexes reversibly form [Ln(thf)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)][(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)] species upon solvent coordination. Depending on the complexed lanthanide ion, this drastic modulation of the coordination environment can be exploited to switch the photoluminescence properties (Ce, Tb) or magnetic behaviour (Nd, Er) of the parent complex.

Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single-molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self-sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity in the Zirconium Acid Triphosphate ZrH5(PO4)3
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a new crystalline acid Zr triphosphate which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in anhydrous conditions (relative humiditiy, RH, &#8810;1&#8201;%). This value of anhydrous proton conductivity is unprecedented and could unlock applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.







Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state proton conductors with high proton conductivity at low temperatures is crucial for the implementation of hydrogen&#8208;based technologies for portable and automotive applications. Here, we report on the discovery of a new crystalline metal acid triphosphate, ZrH5(PO4)3 (ZP3), which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous conditions. This is the highest anhydrous proton conductivity ever reported in a crystalline solid proton conductor in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C. Superprotonic conductivity in ZP3 is enabled by extended defective frustrated hydrogen bond chains, where the protons are dynamically disordered over two oxygen centers. The high proton conductivity and stability in anhydrous conditions make ZP3 an excellent candidate for innovative applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Double [9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene D9H with D2 symmetry has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;=18&#8201;%) in the near&#8208;infrared region and notable dissymmetry factor (gCD=0.019) in the visible region.







Abstract
Double helicenes are appealing chiral frameworks. Their &#960;&#8208;extension is desirable to achieve (chir)optical response in the visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, but access to higher double [n]helicenes (n&#8805;8) has remained challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene (D9H), unambiguously revealing its structure by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H shows remarkable NIR emission from 750 to 1100&#8197;nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 18&#8201;%. In addition, optically pure D9H exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 0.019 at 590&#8197;nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.

         <title>Computational Evolution Of New Catalysts For The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction was discovered using a graph&#8208;based genetic algorithm. The catalytic activity was experimentally verified by a kinetic study and the newly discovered catalyst outcompetes a widely used catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from randomly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessibility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One suggested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of the peripheral membrane protein KRAS4b promotes oncogenic signaling. Using nanodiscs to enable paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments, we show that KRAS4b dimers associate through distinct conformations depending on lipid composition. Both states involve the &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, however increasing phosphatidylserine concentration alters the relative protomer orientation, shifting R135 electrostatic interactions from D153 to E168.







Abstract
KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in &#8776;30&#8201;% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the &#8220;&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5&#8221; interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.

         <title>Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation with MFU&#8208;4&#8201;and Selectivity Reversal via Postsynthetic Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFU&#8208;4 shows high selectivity for adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 owing to a large activation energy for C2H2 diffusion through narrow pore apertures. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange increases the pore aperture size, allowing MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F to adsorb a large quantity of C2H2 and exhibit reversed selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Although many porous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have been reported to selectively adsorb C2H2 in C2H2/CO2 separation processes, CO2&#8208;selective sorbents are much less common. Here, we report the remarkable performance of MFU&#8208;4 (Zn5Cl4(bbta)3, bbta=benzo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;bistriazolate) toward inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The MOF facilitates kinetic separation of CO2 from C2H2, enabling the generation of high purity C2H2 (&gt;98&#8201;%) with good productivity in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Adsorption kinetics measurements and computational studies show C2H2 is excluded from MFU&#8208;4 by narrow pore windows formed by Zn&#8722;Cl groups. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange was used to synthesize an analogue (MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F) with expanded pore apertures, resulting in equilibrium C2H2/CO2 separation with reversed selectivity compared to MFU&#8208;4. MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F also exhibits a remarkably high C2H2 adsorption capacity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), allowing fuel grade C2H2 (98&#8201;% purity) to be harvested from C2H2/CO2 mixtures by room temperature desorption.

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of structurally well&#8208;defined bimetallic complexes (FeFe, NiFe, NiNi, ZnFe, NiZn) was used as a molecular platform to understand Ni/Fe cooperative water oxidation mechanism. The results disclosed that O&#8722;O bond formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety in NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O species, which provides a helpful guidance for rational design of heterobimetallic catalysts.







Abstract
We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8722;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8722;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the Catellani reactions has enabled the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls starting from aryl iodides and bromides. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation (32 examples and 6 subsequent derivatizations), a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halide complexes.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp2)&#8722;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through ortho C&#8722;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond. A large variety of valuable o&#8208;iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halides complexes.

A new molecular design strategy has been proposed to construct the deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF molecules by the integration of asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N and symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units to form a rigid and extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton. The resultant ODBN exhibited deep&#8208;blue emission, high PLQY of 93&#8201;% and small FWHM of 26&#8197;nm. High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLED employing ODBN as emitter was achieved with maximum EQE value of 24.15&#8201;% and the CIE y coordinate below 0.1.







Abstract
Developing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we proposed a design strategy by integrating asymmetric oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (O&#8722;B&#8722;N) multi&#8208;resonance (MR) unit into traditional N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR molecules to form a rigid and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR &#960;&#8208;skeleton. Three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters of OBN, NBN and ODBN featuring asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N, symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units were synthesized through the regioselective one&#8208;shot electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation at different positions of the same precursor. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter ODBN exhibited respectable deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high photoluminescence quantum yield of 93&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26&#8197;nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing ODBN as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15&#8201;% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.

The proof-of-concept emitter &lt;b&gt;ODBN&lt;/b&gt; exhibited respectable deep-blue emission with Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high photoluminescence quantum yield of 93&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26&#8197;nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing &lt;b&gt;ODBN&lt;/b&gt; as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15&#8201;% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective 1,2&#8208;Reduction and Regiodivergent Deuteration of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient protocol for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of arenes via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium has been reported for the first time. The versatility of this strategy further leads to a regiodivergent reductive deuteration that enables precise control of the deuteration sites as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, a general strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of chromium&#8208;bound arenes was developed, thus providing rapid access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Selective arene activation via &#960;&#8208;complexation along with the use of mild hydride Ph3SiH can overcome the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds while tolerating various reduction&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Its versatility further enables a regiodivergent deuteration. Using different sequences of (non)deuterated hydride and acid reagents, the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation can be controlled precisely, which leads to a large and previously inaccessible chemical space for 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on intermediate capture and control experiments. The synthetic value of this selective 1,2&#8208;reduction was demonstrated in the formal total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;galanthamine and (&#177;)&#8208;lycoramine.

         <title>Lithium Aluminium Hydride and Metallic Iron: A Powerful Team in Alkene and Arene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium aluminium hydride is well&#8208;known as a stoichiometric reducing agent for ketones. In combination with finely divided Fe0 it is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation of challenging alkenes or even arenes. The actual catalyst is a thermal decomposition product of LiAlH4 and Fe0. The preactivated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst is also active under mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Alkenes that normally do not react with LiAlH4 (3&#8208;hexene, cyclohexene, 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene), can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes by a mixture of LiAlH4 and Fe0 (the iron was activated by Metal&#8208;Vapour&#8208;Synthesis). This alkene&#8208;to&#8208;alkane conversion with a stoichiometric quantity of LiAlH4/Fe0 does not need quenching with water or acids, implying that both H's originate from LiAlH4. The LiAlH4/Fe0 combination is also a remarkably potent cooperative catalyst for hydrogenation of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes and benzene or toluene. An induction period of circa two hours and the minimally required temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, suggests that the actual catalyst is a combination of Fe0 and the decomposition product of LiAlH4 (LiH and Al0). A thermally pre&#8208;activated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst did not need an induction time and is also active at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar H2. A combination of AliBu3 and Fe0 is an even more active hydrogenation catalyst. Without pre&#8208;activation, tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes like Me2C=CMe2 and toluene could be fully hydrogenated.

         <title>Reversible Live&#8208;Cell Labeling with Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags Enables Long&#8208;Term High&#8208; and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds&#8208;to&#8208;minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&#8722;1) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&#8722;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;5&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.

         <title>In situ Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Controllable Heterogeneous Supramolecular Polymerization of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers and Their Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy for the controllable heterogeneous supramolecular polymerization of liquid crystalline block copolymers. This strategy was demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust, and amphiphilic triblock copolymer&#8208;like supramolecular polymers were directly fabricated, which could spontaneously undergo high&#8208;level assembly to form hierarchical structures in a controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly morphologies of subunits are largely governed by thermodynamics, which plays a less important role in dimensional control. Particularly for one&#8208;dimensional assemblies from block copolymers (BCPs), the negligible energy difference between short and long ones imposes great challenges in length control. Herein, we report that by incorporating additional polymers to induce in situ nucleation and trigger the subsequent growth, controllable supramolecular polymerization driven by mesogenic ordering effect could be realized from liquid crystalline BCPs. The length of the resultant fibrillar supramolecular polymers (SP) is controlled by tuning the ratio between nucleating and growing components. Depending on the choice of BCPs, the SPs can be homopolymer&#8208;like, heterogeneous triblock, and even pentablock copolymer&#8208;like. More interestingly, with insoluble BCP as a nucleating component, amphiphilic SPs are fabricated, which can undergo spontaneous hierarchical assembly.

         <title>N&#8208;(Morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide: A Shelf&#8208;Stable, Bilateral Platform Molecule Enabling Access to Diverse Unsymmetrical Disulfides

A shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare disulfurating reagent with chemoselectively displaceable amino and imide leaving groups is described. Protonation of this reagent promotes exclusive displacement of the amino group with various neutral carbon nucleophiles. The resulting dithiophthalimides are amenable to diverse substitution reactions under basic or neutral conditions, thus enabling expedient access to structurally diverse unsymmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
Synthetic methods for unsymmetrical disulfides are greatly needed owing to their applications in drug discovery, linker chemistry, and materials sciences. In this study, a new shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare bilateral disulfurating platform molecule, N&#8208;(morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides. The amino and imide leaving groups of this reagent can be orthogonally transformed. Under acidic conditions, the amino moiety undergoes selective protonation and thus can be displaced by various carbon nucleophiles, such as allyl trimethylsilanes, alkynyl silanes, and electron&#8208;rich arenes, leaving the phthalimide moiety untouched. Meanwhile, the phthalimide leaving group is amenable to substitution under basic or neutral conditions. The combination of these transformations provides rapid access to diverse unsymmetrical disulfides through two C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Turning the Inert Element Zinc into an Active Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>

Atomically dispersed Zn&#8722;N4 sites mediate transfer of electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to dissolved oxygen (DO). Self&#8208;oxidation of pollutants is realized along with PMS oxidation into singlet oxygen (1O2) and DO reduction into superoxide radicals (O2.&#8722;) for catalytic oxidation of contaminants. Resource consumption and residual sulfate anion (SO42&#8722;) formation are reduced.







Abstract
Amongst various Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the zinc (Zn)&#8208;related SACs have been barely reported due to the fully occupied 3d10 configuration of Zn2+ being inactive for the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Herein, the inert element Zn is turned into an active single&#8208;atom catalyst (SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC) for Fenton&#8208;like chemistry by forming an atomic Zn&#8722;N4 coordination structure. The SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC shows admirable Fenton&#8208;like activity in organic pollutant remediation, including self&#8208;oxidation and catalytic degradation by superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the single&#8208;atomic Zn&#8722;N4 site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration PMS toward dissolved oxygen (DO) to actuate DO reduction into O2&#8901;&#8722; and successive conversion into 1O2. This work inspires an exploration of efficient and stable Fenton&#8208;like SACs for sustainable and resource&#8208;saving environmental applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Free&#8208;Standing 2D Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Polyimine Membrane for Selective Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of flexible dibenzo&#8208;14&#8208;crown&#8208;4&#8208;ether moieties into a rigid framework has led to the generation of a bioinspired ultrathin membrane that allows proton transport. The interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond/water networks and ideal binding sites result in the highly selective and fast transportation of protons through the membrane.







Abstract
Biological proton channels play important roles in the delicate metabolism process, and have led to great interest in mimicking selective proton transport. Herein, we designed a bioinspired proton transport membrane by incorporating flexible 14&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (14C4) units into rigid frameworks of polyimine films by an interfacial Schiff base reaction. The Young's modulus of the membrane reaches about 8.2&#8197;GPa. The 14C4 units could grab water, thereby forming hydrogen bond&#8208;water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi&#8208;planar molecular sheets. Furthermore, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions through host&#8211;guest interactions. Thus, the ion conductance follows H+&#8811;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+, and an ultrahigh selectivity of H+/Li+ (ca. 215) is obtained. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes by embedding macrocycle motifs with inherent cavities.

         <title>Practical and General Alcohol Deoxygenation Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for alcohol deoxygenation that functions across a wide range of alcohol structures is reported. This approach combines the reductive potency of carbon dioxide radical anion with acidic additives to promote the kinetically slow C(sp3)&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for the removal of alcohol functional groups through reductive cleavage of their benzoate ester analogs. This transformation requires a strong single electron transfer (SET) reductant and a means to accelerate slow fragmentation following substrate reduction. To accomplish this, we developed a photocatalytic system that generates a potent reductant from formate salts alongside Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids that promote fragmentation of the reduced intermediate. This deoxygenation procedure is effective across structurally and electronically diverse alcohols and enables a variety of difficult net transformations. This protocol requires no precautions to exclude air or moisture and remains efficient on multigram scale. Finally, the system can be adapted to a one&#8208;pot benzoylation&#8208;deoxygenation sequence to enable direct alcohol deletion. Mechanistic studies validate that the role of acidic additives is to promote the key C(sp3)&#8722;O bond fragmentation step.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chromone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorogen called CPVCM can undergo a specific amination with primary amines and photoarrangement under UV irradiation. Its applications in developing multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors and an all&#8208;round information encryption system are based on its properties of multiple controls and responses.







Abstract
Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.

Herein, we reported an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple-colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all-round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Outer&#8208;Shell Self&#8208;Supported Nickel Catalysts for the Synthesis of Polyolefin Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general heterogenization route was employed to prepare outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supported &#945;&#8208;diimine Ni catalysts. These heterogeneous catalysts demonstrate high activity, stable catalytic performances towards different fillers, and good morphology control in the synthesis of polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties.







Abstract
In situ heterogeneous olefin polymerization has attracted much attention for the synthesis of polyolefin composites. However, the complicated syntheses of specially designed catalysts or the detrimental effects of interactions between catalyst and solid supports pose great challenges. In this contribution, an outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supporting strategy was designed to heterogenize nickel catalysts on different fillers via precipitation homopolymerization of ionic cluster type polar monomer. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, good product morphology control, and stable performances in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. Moreover, various polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties can be efficiently synthesized.

         <title>Regulating the Synergistic Effect in Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts by Adjusting the Coupling Strength Between Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, different metal center spacing or different conjugation degree of bridge skeleton were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers for OER.







Abstract
Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect is still limited since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on OER performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs, CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8208;performance relationships, which is important for the rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.

         <title>Spontaneous Chirality Induction in the Assembly of a Single Layer 2D Network with Switchable Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer chiral 2D network structures with photoswitchable internal cavities have been formed by the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene&#8208;based tetrapod aromatic amphiphiles, with spontaneous chirality induction arising from the breaking of both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The chiral network structures can selectively catch one enantiomer from a racemic solution and then release it upon UV irradiation through reversible pore deformation.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral sheet structures are attractive because of their unique chemical and physical properties, single layer 2D chiral network structures with switchable pore interior remain elusive. Here we report spontaneous chirality induction in a single layer 2D network structure formed from the self&#8208;assembly of tetrapod azobenzene molecules. The chirality induction arises from multiple sublayers slipped in a preferred direction in which the sublayer consists of unidentical molecular arrangements in the in&#8208;plane a and b directions, breaking both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The protruded azobenzene units in the pore interior can be selectively isomerized upon UV irradiation, resulting in a reversible deformation of the chiral pores while maintaining the 2D frameworks. The chiral network can thus selectively entrap one enantiomer from a racemic solution with near perfect enantioselectivity, and then release it upon UV irradiation.

         <title>Managing Secondary Phase Lead Iodide in Hybrid Perovskites via Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Robust Environmental Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;reconstruction strategy that converts the excess unstable PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer on the surface of perovskite films by employing the rationally selected mediator ((C2H5O)3Si(CH2)3NH3)2SO4 in toluene, has been used to stabilize the soft perovskite lattice for synchronously boosting the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability of perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Rationally managing the secondary&#8208;phase excess lead iodide (PbI2) in hybrid perovskite is of significance for pursuing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the challenge remains on its conversion to a homogeneous layer that is robust stable against environmental stimuli. We herein demonstrate an effective strategy of surface reconstruction that converts the excess PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer, which substantially stabilizes the perovskite film and reduces interfacial charge transfer barrier in the PSCs device. The perovskite films with such bi&#8208;layer could bear harsh conditions such as soaking in water, light illumination at 70&#8201;% relative humidity, and the damp&#8208;thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% humidity) environment. The resulted PSCs deliver a champion efficiency up to 24.09&#8201;%, as well as remarkable environmental stability, e.g., retaining 78&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 5500&#8197;h of shelf storage, and 82&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h of operational stability testing.

We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;palladium/hydrogen shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group, which provides a divergent access to substituted 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans and indolines. Further studies unveiled a novel relayed decarbonylative Catellani&#8208;type reaction. Mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations have shed light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4&#8208;palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5&#8208;palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5&#8208;palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a PdIV intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4-palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5-Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5-Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5-membered-dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5-palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5-palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a Pd&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;In nanoalloy supported on Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 is a highly efficient catalyst for electroassisted propane dehydrogenation. Surface doping of Sm3+ enriched the surface proton density on TiO2 by charge compensation, which boosted propane dehydrogenation by accelerating proton collision on propane due to enhanced surface protonics. A propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was achieved at 300&#8201;&#176;C, which is far beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation.







Abstract
Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt&#8722;In alloy was deposited on the Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1&#8197;mol&#8201;% to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was obtained at 300&#8201;&#176;C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5&#8201;%. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Adsorbed Polymer&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zn and Non&#8208;Aqueous Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized PEG adsorption interphases realize highly reversible Zn/Li anodes. The organic/inorganic SEI layer induced by the adsorbed PEG interphases plays a key role in the stability of the metal anode and the low N/P ratio full cells.







Abstract
Polymers are known to adsorb spontaneously from liquid solutions in contact with high&#8208;energy substrates to form configurationally complex, but robust phases that often exhibit higher durability than might be expected from the individual physical bonds formed with the substrate. Rational control of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of such interphases has emerged as a fundamental opportunity for scientific and technological advances in energy storage technology but requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the conformation states and electrochemical effect of the adsorbed polymers. Here, we analyze the interfacial adsorption of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of moderate sizes dissolved in protic and aprotic liquid electrolytes and find that there is an optimum polymer molecular weight of approximately 400&#8197;Da at which the highest columbic efficiency is achieved for both Zn and Li deposition. These findings point to a simple, versatile approach for extending the lifetime of batteries.

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available point chirality units have been embedded adjacent to dicyanostilbene moieties in monomers to effect cooperative supramolecular polymerization. This effective and economic approach based on the synergistic participation of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, which facilitate remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core, allows photodetection based on circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Circularly polarized photodetectors require chiral light absorption materials with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection capability with a dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to those of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90&#8201;% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerization provides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING potentiates immunotherapy agents. Using a luminescence&#8208;based cellular assay, we discovered a novel protein&#8208;protein interaction modulator, SB24011, that inhibited the STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction and upregulated cellular STING levels. As a result, SB24011 boosted STING immunity and improved the in vivo efficacy of immunotherapy with a STING agonist and an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody.







Abstract
Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein&#8208;protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29&#8208;induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno&#8208;oncology.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Discovery of Potent Broad&#8208;Spectrum Vaccine Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Au nanoparticle (AuNP) adjuvants are prepared through computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning to discover agonist ligands, and sulfur&#8208;Au coordination chemistry guided well&#8208;ordered presentation of ligands on AuNP surface. These AuNP adjuvants show advantages in multi&#8208;toll like receptor (TLR) targeting and application as broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants to boost robust multifaceted anti&#8208;tumor vaccine responses.







Abstract
Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long&#8208;lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR)&#8208;targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor&#8208;specific antigens to immunize mice against B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and 4T1&#8208;PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer&#8208;aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.

     alt="Computer-Aided Discovery of Potent Broad-Spectrum Vaccine Adjuvants"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Au nanoparticle (AuNP) adjuvants are prepared through computer-aided molecule design and machine learning to discover agonist ligands, and sulfur-Au coordination chemistry guided well-ordered presentation of ligands on AuNP surface. These AuNP adjuvants show advantages in multi-toll like receptor (TLR) targeting and application as broad-spectrum adjuvants to boost robust multifaceted anti-tumor vaccine responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil-in-water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long-lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer-aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad-spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll-like receptor (TLR)-targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor-specific antigens to immunize mice against B16-OVA melanoma and 4T1-PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer-aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8208;Aryl Glycosylation by Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroaryl Glycosyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones undergo desulfonylative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling with aryl&#8208;substituted nucleophiles or electrophiles through two complementary catalytic systems. The reactions offer access to a wide variety of C&#8208;aryl glycoside products with high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are increasingly gaining attention in carbohydrate chemistry because they enable glycosyl precursors, readily accessible as anomeric mixtures, to converge to a single diastereomeric product. However, controlling the stereochemical outcome through transition&#8208;metal catalysis remains challenging, and methods that leverage bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfone donors to facilitate glycosylation are rare. Herein, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles through distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse C&#8208;aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional&#8208;group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers was possible for key sugar residues.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on Solvation Structure of Carbonate Electrolyte toward Durable Sodium Metal Battery at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte is designed by molecular engineering of solvated structure. By introducing the additive ethylene sulfate, the sodium ion diffusion barrier is lowered and strong solid electrolyte interphase is formed, inhibiting sodium dendrite growth. The as&#8208;fabricated cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;cycle performance at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Carbonate electrolytes have excellent chemical stability and high salt solubility, which are ideally practical choice for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium (Na) metal battery at room temperature. However, their application at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C) is adversely affected by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by electrolyte decomposition and the difficulty of desolvation. Here, we designed a novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte by molecular engineering on solvation structure. The calculations and experimental results demonstrate that ethylene sulfate (ES) reduces the sodium ion desolvation energy and promotes the forming of more inorganic substances on the Na surface, which promote ion migration and inhibit dendrite growth. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the Na||Na symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle of 1500&#8197;hours, and the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) battery achieves 88.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Reversible Zn Metal Anodes Enabled by Trace Amounts of Underpotential Deposition Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
M is a metal with a higher reduction potential and work function than Zn. If Mn+ is used as an electrolyte additive, Mn+ will deposit preferentially and then render UPD of Zn uniformly on M. Moreover, the deposited M can dissolve back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping and thus does not increase the interfacial charge transfer resistance, enabling a highly reversible Zn anode. Ni2+, Cr2+, and Co2+ have been verified to function as Mn+.







Abstract
Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic&#8208;level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni2+) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr3+ and Co2+ additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic&#8208;level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Guided Nickel&#8208;Indium Heterogeneous Alloy Electrocatalysts for Promoting the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch guides the selective alloying of tetragonal In to fcc Ni rather than hcp Ni. The heterogeneous alloy with 5&#8197;at% In catalyzes the electrochemical production of 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with 9.15&#8197;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency at 400&#8197;mV vs. RHE in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
The immiscibility of crystallographic facets in multi&#8208;metallic catalysts plays a key role in driving the green H2 production by water electrolysis. The lattice mismatch between tetragonal In and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ni is 14.9&#8201;% but the mismatch with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Ni is 49.8&#8201;%. Hence, in a series of Ni&#8722;In heterogeneous alloys, In is selectively incorporated in the fcc Ni. The 18&#8211;20&#8197;nm Ni particles have 36&#8197;wt&#8201;% fcc phase, which increases to 86&#8201;% after In incorporation. The charge transfer from In to Ni, stabilizes the Ni0 state and In develops a fractional positive charge that favors *OH adsorption. With only 5&#8197;at% In, 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 is evolved at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with mass activity of 57.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at&#8212;400&#8197;mV, 200&#8197;h stability at &#8722;0.18&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Pt&#8208;like activity at high current densities, due to the spontaneous water dissociation, lower activation energy barrier, optimal adsorption energy of OH&#8722; ions and the prevention of catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Origin of the Activity Trend in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethanol over VOx/CeO2
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using operando time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped activity trend in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol over VOx/CeO2 catalysts as a function of VOx surface coverage. Vanadium and cerium synergistically change their oxidation states during the catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity correlates with the concentration of reversible Ce4+/3+ species.







Abstract
Supported vanadia (VOx) is a versatile catalyst for various redox processes where ceria&#8208;supported VOx have shown to be particularly active in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols. In this work, we clarify the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped ethanol ODH activity trend for VOx/CeOx catalysts using operando quick V K&#8208; and Ce L3&#8208; edge XAS experiments performed under transient conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate that both vanadium and cerium are synergistically involved in alcohol ODH. The concentration of reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ species was identified as the main descriptor of the alcohol ODH activity. The activity drop in the volcano plot, observed at above ca. 3&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;2 surface loading (ca. 30&#8201;% of VOx monolayer coverage), is related to the formation of spectator V4+ and Ce3+ species, which were identified here for the first time. These results might prove to be helpful for the rational optimization of VOx/CeO2 catalysts and the refinement of the theoretical models.

         <title>Sulfonyl&#8208;PYBOX Ligands Enable Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Azides by CuAAC</title>

We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides by Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (CuAAC), providing facile access to chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary azides and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with newly developed PYBOX ligands with a C4 sulfonyl group. The key role of the C4 sulfonyl in tuning the electronic and steric properties of the chiral catalysts to enhance enantiomer discrimination is rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8208;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands, bearing a C4 sulfonyl group, enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone, and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high to excellent ee values. DFT calculations and control experiments reveal that the C4 sulfonyl group decreases the Lewis basicity of the ligand and increases the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and functions as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.

         <title>Optical and Electrochemical Probes for Monitoring Cytochrome&#8197;c in Subcellular Compartments During Apoptosis</title>

Photoresponsive Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c)&#8208;sensing probes consisting of fluorescent caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer frameworks or redox&#8208;active caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanoelectrodes are introduced. Light&#8208;activated, spatially confined, optical or electrochemical detection of Cyt.&#8201;c, in cellular subdomains, at the single cell level is demonstrated. The analytical tools are applied to monitor intracellular Cyt.&#8201;c translocation upon cell apoptosis.







Abstract
Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c) is a key initiator of the caspases that activate cell apoptosis. The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments and the detection of Cyt.&#8201;c delivery between cellular compartments upon apoptosis is important for probing cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments at the single cell level. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzylphosphate ester&#8208;caged Cyt.&#8201;c aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell compartments, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt.&#8201;c through the formation of Cyt.&#8201;c/aptamer complexes at non&#8208;apoptotic or apoptotic conditions. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments of epithelial MCF&#8208;10A breast cells and malignant MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cells under apoptotic/non&#8208;apoptotic conditions.

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional polymer passivation network was constructed by combining the bulk in situ polymerization and surface pre&#8208;polymerization/secondary polymerization strategies. The all&#8208;rounded passivation structure increased carrier diffusion length, promoted energy level alignment and carrier injection. Corresponding devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V with an efficiency over 24&#8201;%, and module also achieves an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
The spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24&#8201;% (the certified efficiency is 24.16&#8201;%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and efficient Sn2+ vacancy tuning strategy is proposed to achieve strongly localized excitons in two&#8208;dimensional (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets by separating corner&#8208;sharing [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thereby promoting their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported thus far for tin iodide perovskites.







Abstract
Exciton localization is an approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.

         <title>Development of a Versatile Protein Labeling Tool for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging Using Fluorescent &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protein labeling system was developed using non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. Fluorophore&#8208;diazabicyclooctane prodrug conjugates efficiently and stably labeled &#946;&#8208;lactamase tag&#8208;fused proteins localized in various intracellular compartments in living cells. Furthermore, use of a pH&#8208;activatable fluorophore allowed visualization of lysosomal protein trafficking at the late stage of autophagy under cellular starvation.







Abstract
To understand the function of protein in live cells, real&#8208;time monitoring of protein dynamics and sensing of their surrounding environment are important methods. Fluorescent labeling tools are thus needed that possess fast labeling kinetics, high efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability. We developed a versatile chemical protein&#8208;labeling tool based on fluorophore&#8208;conjugated diazabicyclooctane &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and wild&#8208;type TEM&#8208;1 &#946;&#8208;lactamase protein tag. The fluorescent probes efficiently formed a stable carbamoylated complex with &#946;&#8208;lactamase, and the labeled proteins were visualized over a long period of time in live cells. Moreover, use of an &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carboxylate ester&#8208;based BLI prodrug enabled the probe to permeate cell membranes and stably label intracellular proteins after unexpected spontaneous ester hydrolysis. Lastly, combining the labeling tool with a pH&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe allowed visual monitoring of lysosomal protein translocation during autophagy.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a rational catalyst design process by integrating theoretical prediction and experimental realization. Asymmetrically coordinated iridium single atoms IrN3O embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks are unambiguously revealed for the optimum formic acid electro&#8208;oxidation catalysis, which reaches a peak current of 20.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1, 167&#8197;times superior to that of the Ir/C nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8722;xOx (x=1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunable Transition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of cation exchange with different crystal structures is limited. We propose a new descriptor, the parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), to synthesize transition metal sulfides with crystal structure selectivity by gas&#8208;phase cation exchange&#8208;induced topological transformation. Powered by precise synthetic control, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is improved by 36.2 times after band gap engineering.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the band gap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.

         <title>Insights into the Role of Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photobase in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in (sp3)C&#8722;H Oxygenation of Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones is enabled by mpg&#8208;CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) is a transition metal free semiconductor that mediates a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Although photoinduced electron transfer is often postulated in the mechanism, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a more favorable pathway for substrates possessing X&#8722;H bonds. Upon excitation of an (sp2)N&#8208;rich structure of g&#8208;CN with visible light, it behaves as a photobase&#8212;it undergoes reductive quenching accompanied by abstraction of a proton from a substrate. The results of modeling allowed us to identify active sites for PCET&#8212;the &#8216;triangular pockets&#8217; on the edge facets of g&#8208;CN. We employ excited state PCET from the substrate to g&#8208;CN to selectively cleavethe endo&#8208;(sp3)C&#8722;H bond in oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;ones followed by trapping the radical with O2. This reaction affords 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones. Measurement of the apparent pKa value and modeling suggest that g&#8208;CN excited state can cleave X&#8722;H bonds that are characterized by bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) &#8776;100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine-2,4-diones is enabled by mpg-CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton-coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond was proposed for the fast synthesis of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs), achieving the construction of a HCOFs library with diverse nanostructures. The synthesized HCOFs with abundant cavities are ideal nanocarriers for high&#8208;efficiency drug loading, thus enhancing the sonodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.

Enantiopure (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) [6]helicene with a seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene have been simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with opposite helicity from optically pure doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors.

Abstract
Enantiopure [6]helicene containing an embedded seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) with opposite helicity were simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with a perfect stereospecificity through stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations of doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The helical handedness of the [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes was fully stereocontrolled by the doubly axial chirality of the precursors as a result of complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer. The cyclizations proceeded in a stepwise manner; the first six&#8208;membered ring formation was followed by the kinetically controlled seven&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring formation with or without helix&#8208;inversion of a [4]helicene intermediate generated during the first cyclization step, thus quantitatively producing enantiopure circularly polarized luminescent [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes with opposite helicity.

         <title>Unlocking a (Pseudo)&#8208;Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) comprising a tetragold metallobox and a tetraoctynyl&#8208;pyrene guest that can be regarded as a pseudo&#8208;metallosuit[4]ane is described. In contrast to other MIMs, the tetrasubstituted guest can be released from this molecule by the addition of coronene through a &#8220;shoehorning&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only because of their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo&#8208;assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo&#8208;suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra&#8208;substituted pyrene guest by the addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. Combined experimental and computational studies allowed the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest to be explained, through a process that we named &#8220;shoehorning&#8221;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size to slide in and out the metallobox.

         <title>Spin Manipulation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Layer through Mechanical Exfoliation for Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of Fe3+ spin states from high spin (HS; s=5/2) in bulk crystals to mixed spin lattices (with s=5/2 and low spin (LS); s=1/2) is demonstrated in a two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layer catalyst by mechanical exfoliation. The resulting catalyst has enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction (CO2RR) over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Spin manipulation of transition&#8208;metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve activity and/or selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate room&#8208;temperature spin state of catalytic centers. Herein, we report a mechanical exfoliation strategy to in situ induce partial spin crossover from high&#8208;spin (s=5/2) to low&#8208;spin (s=1/2) of the ferric center. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed&#8208;spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with selectivity of 91.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of high&#8208;spin bulk counterpart (50&#8201;% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low&#8208;spin 3d&#8208;orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO2 adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.

Density functional theory calculations reveal that low-spin 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Luminescence and Domino Phase Transition of Hybrid Copper Halides with Nonlinear Optical Switching Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive luminescent material has been developed that not only exhibits reversible photoluminescence conversion and nonlinear optical switching in response to thermal stimulus, but also displays peculiar crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition induced domino&#8208;type single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition and mechanical force induced phase transition under concomitant emission&#8208;color change.







Abstract
Although phase transition materials (PTMs) under external stimuli are of great research interest duo to their rich potential applications, it is still challenging to explore multi&#8208;responsive PTMs. Herein, two different phases of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid copper&#8208;based halides, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Gua3Cu2I5 (Gua+=CN3H6+), were synthesized by solvent evaporation method, which they crystalize in the noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2 with zero&#8208;dimensional structure and centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halogen framework, respectively. Interestingly, it is firstly demonstrated that Gua3Cu2I5 simultaneously possesses reversible PL conversion and NLO switching properties in response to thermal stimulus. Strikingly, apart from heat, its structural phase transition can also be triggered by crystalline&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition (CPR) and mechanical force. These new findings may pave a path for future exploration of PTMs with multiple physical properties.

         <title>Red Emissive Double Aza[7]helicenes with Antiaromaticity / Aromaticity Switching via the Redox&#8208;Induced Radical Cation and Dication Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridazine core structure with antiaromatic character has been utilized to synthesize a double aza[7]helicene with rarely accessible chiroptical properties in the red region as well as redox&#8208;active behaviour. This chiral polyaromatic hydrocarbon system shows oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent aromaticity/antiaromaticity switching via oxidation&#8208;induced cation species.







Abstract
We herein present the synthetic approach to a new antiaromatic double aza[7]helicene C that features NN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This heteroatom&#8208;doped helicene showed a rarely obtained long&#8208;wavelength emission and far&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. These optical and chiroptical properties could be ascribed to both the NN&#8208;PAH core structure and the further extension through angular ring fusions. Such a unique electronic structure also culminated in facile chemical oxidations of neutral C to the positively charged chiral radical (C&#8901;+) and dication species (C2+). Interestingly, DFT computations revealed that the pyridazine central core showed an antiaromaticity&#8208;to&#8208;aromaticity switching, in contrast to the inversed transition for the helical periphery in cationic states. The reported approaches are anticipated to lead to the development of further redox&#8208;active chiral systems for potential applications in chiroptoelectronics, spintronics as well as fluorescent bioimaging.

         <title>Multitargeted Platinum(IV) Anticancer Complexes Bearing Pyridinyl Ligands as Axial Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel pyridinyl PtIV complexes obtained by ligand exchange reactions could quickly be reduced to the PtII parent drugs. The axial pyridines acted as leaving group ligands and were utilized for designing multitargeted anticancer prodrugs. These multitargeted pyridinyl PtIV complexes were effective in killing Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth.







Abstract
Although multitargeted PtIV anticancer prodrugs have shown significant activities in reducing drug resistance, the types of bioactive ligands and drugs that can be conjugated to the Pt center remain limited to O&#8208;donors. Herein, we report the synthesis of PtIV complexes bearing axial pyridines via ligand exchange reactions. Unexpectedly, the axial pyridines are quickly released after reduction, indicating their potential to be utilized as axial leaving groups. We further expand our synthetic approach to obtaining two multitargeted PtIV prodrugs containing bioactive pyridinyl ligands: a PARP inhibitor and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; these conjugates exhibit great potential for overcoming drug resistance, and the latter conjugate inhibits the growth of Pt&#8208;resistant tumor in vivo. This research adds to the array of synthetic methods for accessing PtIV prodrugs and significantly increases the types of bioactive axial ligands that can be conjugated to a PtIV center.

         <title>Methane Photooxidation with Nearly 100&#8201;% Selectivity Towards Oxygenates: Proton Rebound Ensures the Regeneration of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane dehydrogenation over boron nitride nanosheets proceeds via N&#8722;H surface bonds, which function as a hydrogen bonding trap to impede cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds and hinder continuous dehydrogenation. Electrons from the BN surface are injected into the antibonding orbitals of N&#8722;H bonds; thereby, the overoxidation of products into thermodynamically favored CO2 is significantly suppressed.







Abstract
Restrained by uncontrollable dehydrogenation process, the target products of methane direct conversion would suffer from an inevitable overoxidation, which is deemed as one of the most challenging issues in catalysis. Herein, based on the concept of a hydrogen bonding trap, we proposed a novel concept to modulate the methane conversion pathway to hinder the overoxidation of target products. Taking boron nitride as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, for the first time it is found that the designed N&#8722;H bonds can work as a hydrogen bonding trap to attract electrons. Benefitting from this property, the N&#8722;H bonds on the BN surface rather than C&#8722;H bonds in formaldehyde prefer to cleave, greatly suppressing the continuous dehydrogenation process. More importantly, formaldehyde will combine with the released protons, which leads to a proton rebound process to regenerate methanol. As a result, BN shows a high methane conversion rate (8.5&#8201;%) and nearly 100&#8201;% product selectivity to oxygenates under atmospheric pressure.

By precisely controlling the MOF structure, the electronic structure of the amino group was optimized to act as a double donor of electrons and protons in the process of gold reduction and desorption, thus realizing the selective adsorption, rapid reduction and efficient recovery of gold ions in electronic waste.







Abstract
Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8&#8201;% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.

         <title>Engineering Flexible Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks with Guest Responsiveness via Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands with multiple coordination sites and solute guests results in flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks featuring guest&#8208;responsive behavior. This leads to a significant transformation in their coordination networks and hence properties, for example, controllable cargo release, and expands the rational design of flexible metal&#8208;organic materials.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8208;organic materials are of growing interest owing to their ability to undergo reversible structural transformations under external stimuli. Here, we report flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to diverse solute guests. The competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands of multiple coordination sites and solute guests (e.g., glucose) primarily determines the responsive behavior of the MPNs, as revealed experimentally and computationally. Glucose molecules can be embedded into the dynamic MPNs upon mixing, leading to the reconfiguration of the metal&#8208;organic networks and thus changes in their physicochemical properties for targeting applications. This study expands the library of stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible metal&#8208;organic materials and the understanding of intermolecular interactions between metal&#8208;organic materials and solute guests, which is essential for the rational design of responsive materials for various applications.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Nitrooxylation: Noncyclic Hypervalent Iodine Nitrooxylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagent is prepared from aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. This reagent facilitates the zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers with broad scope, and also can be used in the nitrooxylation of various enolizable C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Organic nitrates are broadly applied as pharmaceuticals (acting as efficient nitric oxide donor), energetic materials, building blocks in organic synthesis, etc. However, practical and direct methods to access organic nitrates efficiently are still rare, mainly due to the lack of powerful nitrooxylating reagents. Herein, we report bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagents, oxybis(aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanediyl) dinitrates (OAIDNs, 2), which are prepared just by using aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. The reagents are used to achieve a mild and operationally simple protocol to access diverse organic nitrates. By employing of 2, zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers is realized efficiently to access the corresponding &#946;&#8208;nitrooxy ketones with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, a series of direct and catalyst&#8208;free nitrooxylations of enolizable C&#8722;H bonds are carried out smoothly to afford the desired organic nitrates within minutes by just mixing the substrates with 2 in dichloromethane.

This work presents a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new AIEgen&#8208;based free&#8208;standing POP films at room temperature. These POP films show bright luminescence with high PLQY up to 37.8&#8201;% and can encapsulate organic dyes to form efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting thin films.







Abstract
We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16&#8197;nm to &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8&#8201;% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955;=141&#8197;nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET=91&#8201;%), and high antenna effect (11.3).

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be efficiently achieved under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer by micromolar concentrations of iron. The desulfurization mechanism likely involves iron(III) species produced through the oxidation of iron(II)&#8208;carbonate complexes by molecular oxygen and is reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters.







Abstract
One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.

         <title>A Quenched Size&#8208;Expanded Nucleotide Reports Activity of the Leukemia Biomarker Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic probe based on size&#8208;expanded adenosine is used to monitor activity of the leukemia biomarker and therapeutic target Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). The probe can measure TdT activity in cancer cell extract in real&#8208;time and report on its response to treatment. Use of the probe in a high&#8208;throughput screening led to the identification of the non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitor SCH202676.







Abstract
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) is a template&#8208;independent DNA polymerase that plays an essential role in the human adaptive immune system and is upregulated in several types of leukemia. It has therefore gained interest as a leukemia biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Herein, we describe a FRET&#8208;quenched fluorogenic probe based on a size&#8208;expanded deoxyadenosine that reports directly on TdT enzymatic activity. The probe enables real&#8208;time detection of primer extension and de novo synthesis activity of TdT and displays selectivity over other polymerase and phosphatase enzymes. Importantly, TdT activity and its response to treatment with a promiscuous polymerase inhibitor could be monitored in human T&#8208;lymphocyte cell extract and Jurkat cells using a simple fluorescence assay. Finally, employing the probe in a high&#8208;throughput assay resulted in the identification of a non&#8208;nucleoside TdT inhibitor.

         <title>Post&#8208;Nickelation of a Crystalline Trinuclear Copper Organic Framework for Synergistic Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic framework was fabricated by post&#8208;modification of the copper&#8208;containing organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu) with divalent nickel ions. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and nickel ions resulted in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO with a high conversion rate and selectivity.







Abstract
Rational regulation of electronic structures and functionalities of framework materials still remains challenging. Herein, reaction of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tribenzhydrazide with tris(&#956;2&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N,N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper (Cu3Py3) generates the crystalline copper organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu). Post&#8208;modification with divalent nickel ions affords the heterometallic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni). Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical simulations reveal their two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal structure geometry. A series of advanced spectroscopic techniques disclose the mixed CuI/CuII state nature of Cu3Py3 in USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with a uniform bistable Cu34+(CuI2CuII)&#8201;:&#8201;Cu35+(CuICuII2) (ca. 1&#8201;:&#8201;3) oxidation state, resulting in a significantly improved formation efficiency of the charge&#8208;separation state. This endows the Ni sites with enhanced activity and USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with outstanding photocatalytic CO2 to CO performance with a conversion rate of 22&#8201;130&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98&#8201;%.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Redox in Polyimide: Witness by In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;destructive in situ EPR technique is developed to directly observe the electronic signal conversion process of radical anions and dianions upon charge/discharge cycling, verifying the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reaction of polyimide electrodes in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real&#8208;time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two&#8208;electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic&#8208;based LIBs.

         <title>Back Cover: Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 18/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein upregulation by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the strategy opposite to targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article (e202300978), Dong&#8208;Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING&#8208;TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune&#8208;oncology treatment by changing cold to hot tumors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeted protein upregulation&lt;/b&gt; by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the strategy opposite to targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202300978"&gt;(e202300978)&lt;/a&gt;, Dong-Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING-TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune-oncology treatment by changing cold to hot tumors. Thus, targeted protein upregulation can be an alternative drug discovery strategy for undruggable targets.

Cell&#8208;selective regulation of protein translocation is achieved through the rational design of an endogenous enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids platform. The system enables enzyme&#8208;activated capture of proteins of interest and thus regulation of their cytoplasmic&#8208;nuclear shuttling with tumor&#8208;cell specificity, as reported by Mengyuan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214958).

Reversible posttranslational fluorescence labeling opens exciting possibilities for advanced and superresolution microscopy techniques. In their Research Article (e202219050) Michael Holtmannsp&#246;tter, Jacob Piehler et&#8197;al. have engineered HaloTag variants with restored dehalogenase activity, which enzymatically exchange fluorogenic substrates at the second&#8208;to&#8208;minutes time scale. Thus, long&#8208;term time&#8208;lapse imaging with utmost spatial and temporal resolution is achieved with particularly striking performance in single molecule tracking and localization microscopy.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine is one of the most abundant motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, chemists were constrained in their ability to append substituents at the meta&#8208;position of pyridines. Two complementary one&#8208;pot approaches developed independently have helped to overcome this challenge. While one involves breaking the pyridine ring to form linear imines, the other relies on 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions to disrupt the aromaticity of pyridine.







Abstract
The pyridine core is among the most common motifs found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Consequently, the C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine is a prized reaction, as it can help access a broad spectrum of valuable chemicals. However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines hinder their meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre to overcome this challenge involves the temporary conversion of pyridines into electron&#8208;rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring&#8208;opening ring&#8208;closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co&#8208;workers, and a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization sequence via oxazino&#8208;pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to work with complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.

Reconfigurable DNA frameworks provide a plethora of functional materials for constructing DNA nanostructures, operating switchable reactions, controlling optical phenomena, driving dynamic networks and designing materials with switchable properties.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology relies on the structural and functional information encoded in nucleic acids. Specifically, the sequence&#8208;guided reconfiguration of nucleic acids by auxiliary triggers provides a means to develop DNA switches, machines and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The present Review addresses recent advances in the construction and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, networks and materials. Dynamic transformations proceeding within engineered origami frames or between origami tiles, and the triggered dynamic reconfiguration of scaled supramolecular origami structures are addressed. The use of origami frameworks to assemble dynamic chiroplasmonic optical devices and to operate switchable chemical processes are discussed. Also, the dynamic operation of DNA networks is addressed, and the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; stimuli&#8208;responsive all&#8208;DNA materials and their applications are introduced. Future perspectives and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures are presented.

Merging metal and enzyme catalysis provides multiple solutions for the synthesis of optically active molecules. To achieve this aim, both catalyst types need to work under similar reaction conditions avoiding mutual inactivation. Herein, successful one&#8208;pot sequential and concurrent cascades are described for the design of high&#8208;yielding transformations with excellent levels of (stereo)selectivity.







Abstract
The combination of catalytic methods provides multiple advantages in organic synthesis, allowing access to diverse organic molecules in a straightforward manner. Merging metal and enzyme catalysis is currently receiving great attention due to the possibility to assemble metal catalysis in C&#8722;C coupling, olefin metathesis, hydration and other reactions with the exquisite stereospecificity displayed by enzymes. Thus, this minireview is organized based on the action of the metal species (Pd, Ru, Au, Ir, Fe&#8230;) in combination with different enzymes. Special attention will be paid to the design of sequential processes and concurrent cascades, presenting solutions such as the use of surfactants or compartmentalization strategies for those cases where incompatibilities could hamper the overall process.

Peptides have many potential applications as building blocks in materials science and biomedicine since they organise into supramolecular structures. Advances in computational chemistry enable the mapping, searching and systematic evaluation of large sequence spaces to select viable candidates. Integration of computation and experiment provides understanding of specific interactions, enabling engineering of more versatile functional materials.







Abstract
Interest in peptide&#8208;based supramolecular materials has grown extensively since the 1980s and the application of computational methods has paralleled this. These methods contribute to the understanding of experimental observations based on interactions and inform the design of new supramolecular systems. They are also used to virtually screen and navigate these very large design spaces. Increasingly, the use of artificial intelligence is employed to screen far more candidates than traditional methods. Based on a brief history of computational and experimentally integrated investigations of peptide structures, we explore recent impactful examples of computationally driven investigation into peptide self&#8208;assembly, focusing on recent advances in methodology development. It is clear that the integration between experiment and computation to understand and design new systems is becoming near seamless in this growing field.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Emerging Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear optics (NLO) is a field of immense importance owing to its usefulness in lasing, bio&#8208;imaging, etc. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a potential class of NLO materials. This Minireview presents an overview of the principles of NLO, a discussion on various aspects of designing COFs for NLO, and a summary of important real&#8208;life applications of COFs based on their NLO response.







Abstract
The vastness of organic synthetic strategies and knowledge of reticular chemistry have made covalent organic frameworks (COFs) one of the most chemically and structurally diverse class of materials with potential applications ranging from gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis to energy storage and magnetism. Recently, this class of porous materials has garnered increasing interest as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Traditionally, inorganic crystals, small&#8208;molecule organic chromophores, and oligomers have been studied for their NLO response. Nevertheless, COFs offer significant advantages over existing NLO materials in terms of higher mechanical strength, thermochemical stability, and extended conjugation. Herein, we discuss crucial aspects, terminology, and measurement techniques related to NLO, followed by a critical analysis of the design principles for COFs with NLO response. Furthermore, we touch on selected potential applications of these NLO materials. Finally, future prospects and challenges of COFs as NLO materials are discussed.

         <title>Hybrid Acid/alkali All Covalent Organic Frameworks Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery was developed by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. The hybrid battery displays excellent electrochemical performances with wide voltage window, high capacity and good cyclic stability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), thanks to their adjustable porous structure and abundant build&#8208;in functional motifs, have been recently regarded as promising electrode materials for a variety of batteries. There still remain grand opportunities to further utilizing their merits for developing advanced COFs&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. In such a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery, the cathodic COF favorably works in acid with a relatively positive potential, while the anodic COF preferably runs in alkali with a relatively negative potential. It thus can deliver a decently high discharge capacity of 92.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8197;V, and exhibit high energy density of 74.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 along with a considerable cyclic stability over 300 cycles. The development of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept all&#8208;COFs battery may drive forward the improvement of newly cost&#8208;effective and performance&#8208;reliable energy storage devices.

         <title>A Catalytic Method for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Ketones, &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of versatile &#945;&#8208;quaternary acyclic ketones, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and aldehydes, by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles. Transformations employ simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a chiral phosphine, and generate a broad range of products bearing difficult to access dialkyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and 90&#8201;:&#8201;10 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.

         <title>Synthesis of Modified Poly(vinyl Alcohol)s and Their Degradation Using an Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>

Biodegradation of water&#8208;soluble PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade consisting of a lipase, an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water&#8208;soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical&#8208;chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;Biodegradation of water-soluble PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent enzymes. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ-independent novel enzymatic cascade consisting of a lipase, an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water-soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical-chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ-independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching in an FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of two FeIII complexes is reported. The change in spin state is reversible, recorded over several cycles with Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Appending a diethylamino group to the ligand of one of the complexes allows for a colorimetric response from blue&#8208;black to bright pink upon protonation.







Abstract
Reversible proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of an FeIII complex in solution is observed at room temperature. A reversible magnetic response was detected in the complex, [FeIII(sal2323)]ClO4 (1), using Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy which indicated cumulative switching from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin upon addition of one and two equivalents of acid. Infrared spectroscopy suggests a coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) effect, whereby protonation displaces the metal&#8208;phenoxo donors. The analogous complex, [FeIII(4&#8208;NEt2&#8208;sal2323)]ClO4 (2), with a diethylamino group on the ligand, was used to combine the magnetic change with a colorimetric response. Comparison of the protonation responses of 1 and 2 reveals that the magnetic switching is caused by perturbation of the immediate coordination sphere of the complex. These complexes constitute a new class of analyte sensor which operate by magneto&#8208;modulation, and in the case of 2, also yield a colorimetric response.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Chiral Resolution of Expanded Helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;Fused Benzene Rings
</title>

         <dc:description>
Expanded helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings can be synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;coupling&#8208;mediated oligomerization followed by bismuth(III)&#8208;triflate&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their chiroptical properties were also studied.







Abstract
Expanded helicenes are expected to show enhanced chiroptical properties as compared to the classical helicenes but the synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of expanded helicenes Hn (n=1&#8211;4) containing 11, 19, 27 and 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings through Suzuki coupling&#8208;based oligomerization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Enantiopure H2, H3, and H4 can be isolated by chiral HPLC and they all exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) values (0.020 for H2, 0.021 for H3, and 0.021&#8211;0.024 for H4).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Trifluoromethoxylation of Propargyl Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, great challenges still remain for direct asymmetric trifluoromethoxylation with only two successful reports since the first discovery. Here, by subtly tuning the leaving group, protecting group, ligand structure, reaction temperature, solvent and base, we finally realized a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates for the first time.







Abstract
Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity of trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), methods for introducing OCF3 into organic molecules are in high demand. However, the research area of direct enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation is still in the embryonic stage, with limited enantioselectivity and/or reaction types. Here, we describe the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates using trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as the trifluoromethoxy source in up to 96&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8208;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective synthesis of AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers has been rarely reported. Here, ethylene oxide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst owing to a Janus effects of Lewis acid on the activity of the two monomers.







Abstract
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of an Octagermacubane with Two Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanium(0) Atoms and its Unique Radical Anion</title>

A facile synthesis of an octagermacubane, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms, by the thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(silyl)germane and bis(silyl)germane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, is reported. Reduction of the octagermacubane with tBuMe2SiNa yields the first X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of a Ge&#8208;centered octagermacubane radical anion.







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 9 and bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 17 at 100&#8201;&#176;C produces unexpectedly octagermacubane 18, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms (40&#8201;% yield). 18 was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and it is a singlet biradical (according to DFT quantum mechanical calculations and the absence of an EPR signal). Reactions of 18 with CH2Cl2 and H2O yield the novel dichloro&#8208;octagermacubane 24 and hydroxy&#8208;octagermacubane 25, respectively. Reduction of 18 with tBuMe2SiNa in THF produces an isolable octagermacubane radical anion 26&#8208;Na. Based on X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy and DFT quantum mechanical calculations, 26&#8208;Na is classified as a Ge&#8208;centered radical anion.

         <title>Isolation of Structurally Heterogeneous TCR&#8208;CD3 Extracellular Vesicle Subpopulations Using Caliper Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with different T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 oligomerization states has been verified by a proposed caliper strategy. Using a caliper probe with an optimized spacing of 16&#8197;nm, the strategy successfully isolated TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric EVs (mCD3 EVs) and TCR&#8208;CD3 dimeric EVs (dCD3 EVs) from the plasma of a skin transplantation mouse model. Phenotypic analysis confirmed dCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker for acute cellular rejection.







Abstract
Cells in different states can release diverse types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in intracellular communication or pathological processes. The identification and isolation of EV subpopulations are significant to explore their physiological functions and clinical value. In this study, structurally heterogeneous T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 EVs were proposed and verified for the first time using a caliper strategy. Two CD3&#8208;targeting aptamers were designed in the shape of a caliper with an optimized probe distance and were assembled on gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;Caliper) to distinguish TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric and dimeric EVs (m/dCD3 EVs) in skin&#8208;transplanted mouse plasma. Phenotyping and sequencing analysis revealed clear heterogeneity in the isolated m/dCD3 EVs, providing the potential for mCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and holding great prospects for distinguishing EV subpopulations based on protein oligomerization states.

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic cages are an important class of synthetic hosts, which are able to mimic the structural adaptability and allosteric regulation of naturally occurring systems. A low&#8208;symmetry FeII4L4 tetrahedral cage reported here was able to adapt its geometry from S4 to C3 or T symmetry upon guest binding; multiple binding sites allowed the host to simultaneously bind distinct guests with negative allostery.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to a low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.

         <title>Boradigermaallyl: (4+3) Cycloaddition&#8208;Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boradigermaallyl featuring a delocalized &#960;&#8208;bond shows a boron atom insertion into benzene at room temperature. The mechanism starts by a concerted (4+3) reaction between the germanium atoms of the digermaboraallyl and the 1,4&#8208;positions of a benzene molecule. Thus, boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene.







Abstract
The 2&#960; electron 1,3&#8208;dipole boradigermaallyl, valence&#8208;isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s+&#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.

     alt="Boradigermaallyl: (4+3) Cycloaddition-Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boradigermaallyl featuring a delocalized &#960;-bond shows a boron atom insertion into benzene at room temperature. The mechanism starts by a concerted (4+3) reaction between the germanium atoms of the digermaboraallyl and the 1,4-positions of a benzene molecule. Thus, boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2&#960; electron 1,3-dipole boradigermaallyl, valence-isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s+&#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkyne trimerization followed by oxidating coupling and fusion of zinc porphyrin units was used to construct a porphyrin nanoring around a central covalent spoke. The size and shape of these nanorings (diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm) was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A combination of zinc(II) and nickel(II) porphyrin units was used to increase the efficiency of the synthesis and control the positions of oxidative fusion.







Abstract
Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and offer insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six&#8208;armed template, made by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H&#8208;shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative meso&#8208;meso coupling and partial &#946;&#8208;&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge&#8208;fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm).

         <title>Targeting the Dark Lipid Kinase PIP4K2C with a Potent and Selective Binder and Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One obstacle to a better understanding of the &#8220;dark&#8221; lipid kinase PIP4K2C is the lack of chemical tool compounds for this protein. Here, we describe a picomolar PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, and an effective bivalent PIP4K2C degrader, TMX&#8208;4153, both of which display exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Thus, TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 represent two useful leads to further interrogate the therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol 5&#8208;phosphate 4&#8208;kinase, type II, gamma (PIP4K2C) remains a poorly understood lipid kinase with minimal enzymatic activity but potential scaffolding roles in immune modulation and autophagy&#8208;dependent catabolism. Achieving potent and selective agents for PIP4K2C while sparing other lipid and non&#8208;lipid kinases has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of the highly potent PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, which shows exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Furthermore, we elaborated the PIP4K2C binder into TMX&#8208;4153, a bivalent degrader capable of rapidly and selectively degrading endogenous PIP4K2C. Collectively, our work demonstrates that PIP4K2C is a tractable and degradable target, and that TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 are useful leads to further interrogate the biological roles and therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#160;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#160;difficile toxin&#160;A.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8208;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 for Reversible Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Faradaic reactions including charge transfer are often accompanied with diffusion limitation inside the bulk. Conductive two&#8208;dimensional frameworks (2D MOFs) with a fast ion transport can combine both &#8208; charge transfer and fast diffusion inside their porous structure. To study remaining diffusion limitations caused by particle morphology, different synthesis routes of Cu&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu3(HHTP)2), a copper&#8208;based 2D MOF, are used to obtain flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like MOF particles. Both morphologies are systematically characterized and evaluated for redox&#8208;active Li+ ion storage. The redox mechanism is investigated by means of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ XRD. Both types are compared regarding kinetic properties for Li+ ion storage via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A significant influence of particle morphology for 2D MOFs on kinetic aspects of electrochemical Li+ ion storage can be observed. This study opens the path for optimization of redox active porous structures to overcome diffusion limitations of Faradaic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Digital Microfluidics and Magnetic Bead&#8208;based Intact Proteoform Elution for Quantitative Top&#8208;down Nanoproteomics of Single C.&#160;elegans Nematodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While most nanoproteomics approaches for the analysis of low&#8208;input samples are based on bottom&#8208;up proteomics workflows, top&#8208;down approaches enabling proteoform characterization are still underrepresented. Using mammalian cell proteomes, we established a facile one&#8208;pot sample preparation protocol based on protein aggregation on magnetic beads and intact proteoform elution using 40% formic acid. Performed on a digital microfluidics device, the workflow enabled sensitive analyses of single Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, thereby increasing the number of proteoform identifications compared to in&#8208;tube sample preparation by 46%. Label&#8208;free quantification of single nematodes grown under different conditions allowed to identify changes in abundance of proteoforms not distinguishable by bottom&#8208;up proteomics. The presented workflow will facilitate proteoform&#8208;directed analysis on samples of limited availability.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization through Cationic Vacancy Defects in Bi4Ti3O12 for Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) activation technology is of great significance in environmental purification due to its eco&#8208;friendly operation and cost&#8208;effective nature. However, the activation of O2 is limited by spin&#8208;forbidden transitions, and efficient molecular oxygen activation depends on electronic behavior and surface adsorption. Herein, we prepared cationic defect&#8208;rich Bi4Ti3O12 (BTO&#8208;MV2) catalysts containing Ti vacancies (VTi) for O2 activation in water purification. The VTi on BTO nanosheets can induce electron spin polarization, increasing the number of spin&#8208;down photogenerated electrons and reducing the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs. An active surface VTi is also formed, serving as a center for adsorbing O2 and extracting electrons, effectively generating &#8226;OH, O2&#8226;&#8722; and 1O2. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by BTO&#8208;MV2 is 3.3 times faster than BTO, indicating a satisfactory prospect for practical application. This work provides an efficient pathway to activate molecular oxygen by constructing new active sites through cationic vacancy modification technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic nickel embedded in ceria with high specific CO2 methanation activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 hydrogenation to methane is gaining increasing interest as one of the most promising ways to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. Ni particles supported on CeO2 represents a highly efficient, stable and inexpensive catalyst for this reaction. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were tested for CO2 methanation showing an extremely high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando characterization reveals that this performance is tightly associated with ionic &#925;i and Ce3+ surface sites, while formation of metallic Ni does not seem to considerably promote the reaction. Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce&#8208;O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni&#8208;O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni&#8208;Ce pair sites to the activation of H2 and CO2 molecules. To a large extent, the theoretical predictions were validated by in situ spectroscopy under H2 and CO2:H2 gaseous environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in pharmaceuticals because compounds with these motifs are more metabolically stable and more lipophilic than their nonfluorinated analogues. However, hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers have not been extensively studied, presumably because of the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we describe a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution of aryl chlorides or bromides, which act as the limiting reagents, with weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol under mild reaction conditions. This method provides diverse hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers. We demonstrated the generality of this method by carrying out reactions of a large array of unactivated aryl halides, and we found that the success of the reactions relied on arene activation by means of &#951;6&#8208;coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Tungstate&#8208;mediated In&#8208;situ Passivation of Grain Boundary Grooves in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Possessed with advantageous optoelectronic properties, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solution&#8208;processed solar cells. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly weakened by the carrier loss at grain boundary grooves (GBGs); however, it receives limited attention and there lacks effective approach to solve this issue. Herein, for the first time, we constructed the tungstate/perovskite heterointerface via a &#8220;two step&#8221; in&#8208;situ reaction approach that provides effective defect passivation and ensures efficient carrier dynamics at the GBGs. The exposed perovskite at grain boundaries is converted to wide&#8208;band&#8208;gap PbWO4 via an in&#8208;situ reaction between Pb2+ and tungstate ions, which passivate defects due to the strong ionic bonding. Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO4 to CaWO4. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25% in the n&#8208;i&#8208;p device and 23.33% in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7% after ~1100 h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5% after aging in air for ~ 2110 h, and 93.1% after aging at 85 &#176;C in N2 for 972 h.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Possessed with advantageous optoelectronic properties, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solution-processed solar cells. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly weakened by the carrier loss at grain boundary grooves (GBGs); however, it receives limited attention and there lacks effective approach to solve this issue. Herein, for the first time, we constructed the tungstate/perovskite heterointerface via a &#8220;two step&#8221; in-situ reaction approach that provides effective defect passivation and ensures efficient carrier dynamics at the GBGs. The exposed perovskite at grain boundaries is converted to wide-band-gap PbWO4 via an in-situ reaction between Pb2+ and tungstate ions, which passivate defects due to the strong ionic bonding. Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO4 to CaWO4. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25% in the n-i-p device and 23.33% in the p-i-n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7% after ~1100 h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5% after aging in air for ~ 2110 h, and 93.1% after aging at 85 &#176;C in N2 for 972 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elaborating E/Z&#8208;Geometry of Alkenes via Cage&#8208;Confined Arylation Catalysis of Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic cage is applied as an artificial supramolecular reactor to control the reaction of aryl radicals with terminal olefins under green light/solvent conditions, which facilitates selective transformation in the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment to give a series of geometrically defined E/Z&#8208;alkenes. The hydrophobic cage displays good host&#8208;guest inclusion with aromatic substrates, promoting Meerwein arylation and protecting E&#8208;isomeric products during reaction; while a small amount of benzonitrile can turn on efficient E&#8594;Z isomerization. Besides &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, the hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding interactions also act as control forces for the arylation of aliphatic terminal olefins known as poor acceptors in classic Meerwein arylation. The application of this switchable cage&#8208;confined arylation catalysis has been demonstrated by the syntheses of Tapinarof and a marine natural product from the same substrate via controllable E/Z selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Polysulfides through Photocatalyzed Dithiosulfonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we outline a general method for photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, diene, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane using dithiosulfonate reagents (ArSO2&#8722;SSR) with improved atom economy. Both &#8220;ArSO2&#8722;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8722;SSR&#8221; on the dithiosulfonate are transferred under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high stereoselectivity, and complete regioselectivity. Significantly, the resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is a general and practical nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, reacting with a variety of electrophiles efficiently. Both reactions can be conducted in gram scale, rendering the approach highly valuable.</dc:description>

         <title>Minimizing Temperature Bias through Reliable Temperature Determination in Gas&#8208;Solid Photothermal Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enormous advances in photothermal catalysis have been made over the years, whereas the temperature assessment still remains controversial in the majority of photothermal catalytic systems. Herein, we methodically uncovered the phenomenon of temperature determination bias arising from prominent temperature differences in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic systems, which extensively existed yet has been overlooked in most relevant cases. To avoid the interference of temperature bias, we developed a universal protocol for reliable temperature evaluation of gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions, with emphasis on eliminating the temperature gradient and temperature fluctuation of catalyst layer via optimizing the reaction system. This work presents a functional and credible practice for temperature detection, calling attention to addressing the effects of temperature differences, and reassessing the actual temperature&#8208;based performances in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of the &#946;&#8208;Bulge Gate in a Green Fluorescent Protein Accelerates the Kinetics of Sulfate Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of anions in complex aqueous media is a fundamental challenge with practical utility that can be addressed by supramolecular chemistry. Biomolecular hosts such as proteins can be used and adapted as an alternative to synthetic hosts. Here, we report how the mutagenesis of the &#946;&#8208;bulge residues (D137 and W138) in mNeonGreen, a bright, monomeric fluorescent protein, unlocks and tunes the anion preference at physiological pH for sulfate, resulting in the turn&#8208;off sensor SulfOFF&#8208;1. This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the &#946;&#8208;barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <title>A General and Practical Route to Functionalized BCP&#8208;Heteroaryls Enabled by Photocatalytic Multicomponent Heteroarylation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract BCP aryls are an important class of BCP derivatives, with widespread application in drug development. In particular, most of their synthesis requires multiple chemical steps via BCP electrophile or nucleophile from [1.1.1]propellane. While one&#8208;step, multicomponent catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions could provide a more sustainable route to rapidly access diverse BCP&#8208;aryls, the current approaches are limited to tertiary radicals, leading to a decrease in their practical value. In this study, we describe a conceptually different approach enabled by desulfonative multicomponent radical reaction involving [1.1.1]propellane to access functionalized BCP&#8208;heteroaryl products. Importantly, this protocol can be compatible with primary, secondary, tertiary, and various fluoroalkyl radical sources, thus enabling modular synthesis of BCP&#8208;heteroaryl.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective P&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) is an attractive method for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds,&#160;but the development of such a dynamic kinetic asymmetric process remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic intermolecular P&#8208;C coupling of SPOs and aryl iodides catalyzed by copper complexes ligated by a finely modified chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. The reaction tolerates a wide range of SPOs and aryl iodides, affording P&#8208;stereogenic tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) in high yields and with good enantioselectivity (average 89.2% ee). The resulting enantioenriched TPOs were transformed into structurally diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are highly valuable as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Performance&#8208;advantaged Stereoregular Recyclable Plastics Enabled by Aluminum&#8208;catalytic Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Dithiolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically recyclable polymers that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers are attractive candidates to replace non&#8208;recyclable petroleum&#8208;derived plastics. However, the physical properties and mechanical strengths of depolymerizable polymers are commonly insufficient for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5 kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a Tm of 94.5 &#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum&#8208;based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance&#8208;advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemically recyclable polymers that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers are attractive candidates to replace non-recyclable petroleum-derived plastics. However, the physical properties and mechanical strengths of depolymerizable polymers are commonly insufficient for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring-opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5 kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a Tm of 94.5 &#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum-based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance-advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Transformation of Polymer Main Chain Catalyzed by Macrocycle Metal Complexes via Pseudorotaxane Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effects. Developing efficient polymer reactions in artificial systems thus represents a long&#8208;standing objective in the fields of polymer and material science. Here, we show unprecedented macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient polymer reaction that result in 100% transformation of the main chain functional groups presumably via a processive mode reaction. The complete polymer reactions were confirmed in not only intramolecular reaction (hydroamination) but also intermolecular reaction (hydrosilylation) by using Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;catalyzed systems. The most fascinating feature of the both reactions is that higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Various studies suggested that the reactions occur in the catalyst cavity via the formation of a supramolecular complex between the macrocycle catalyst and polymer substrate like pseudorotaxane, which should be of characteristic of the efficient polymer reactions progressing in a processive mode.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination by Cationic&#160;Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral benzylic amines are privileged motifs in pharmacologically active molecules. Intramolecular enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer has emerged as a straightforward, powerful tool for the synthesis of chiral amines, but methods for intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H amination remain elusive. Herein, we report a cationic copper catalytic system for intermolecular enantioselective benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H amination with peroxide as an oxidant. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. More importantly, it can be used to synthesize bioactive molecules, including chiral drugs. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the amination reaction involves benzylic radicals generated by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.</dc:description>
