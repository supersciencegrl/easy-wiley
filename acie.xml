         <title>Fused&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks With Enhanced Chemical and Photochemical Stability for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stable covalent organic framework (TZ&#8208;COF) incorporating fused&#8208;heterocycle linkages has been synthesized, showing exceptional chemical resilience under harsh conditions and superior photostability relative to traditional double&#8208;bond&#8208;linked COFs. The in situ formation of thiazole linkages provides new protonation sites, enhancing the framework's hydrophilicity, expanding its range of light absorption, and reducing exciton binding energy.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused&#8208;heterocycle thiazole&#8208;linked COFs (TZ&#8208;COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction using chrysene&#8208;6,12&#8208;diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused&#8208;ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12&#160;M HCl), strong base (12&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M MeONa), reducing (1&#160;M NaBH4), and oxidizing (1&#160;M H2O2) agents, along with superior photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazoles introduce new, robust protonation sites compared to commonly used imine linkages, which improve the hydrophilicity, expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework. TZ&#8208;COF&#8208;17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.

         <title>Photosensitizer Repositioning Affords an Enantiocomplementary Enzyme for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we capitalize on the versatility offered by genetic code expansion to develop a proficient photoenzyme for [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions that is enantiocomplementary to our recently developed photoenzyme EnT1.3. By repositioning the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer and subsequent directed evolution, we have developed an efficient, highly selective and oxygen tolerant enzyme for a range of [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions.








Abstract
The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1&#160;vs. 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveals a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Engineered Proton Transfer Pathways for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a rationally designed catalyst integrating Ni single atoms and NiO nanoclusters on porous carbon nanosheets for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis in solid electrolytes. This catalyst achieves 97% Faradaic efficiency and 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for pure H2O2 production. The study addresses a critical gap in elucidating proton transfer pathways in solid electrolytes during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells promise electrochemical synthesis of pure hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) remain unclear when using&#160;pure water as the proton source. Both Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, but their practical dominance under SE conditions lacks experimental validation. Herein, we designed a hierarchical Ni&#9472;N2&#9472;C&#9472;O single&#8208;atom/NiO nanocluster co&#8208;decorated porous carbon nanosheet catalyst (NiSA&#8208;NiO/pCNs) that achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a H2O2 partial current density of 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 (equivalent to 6.6&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 production rate) in a porous SE cell. Analysis of reaction intermediates and the local pH using in situ Raman spectroscopy, kinetic isotope effect, and density functional theory simulations showed the critical role of NiO nanoclusters in tuning the protonation pathway: NiO activates the ER mechanism via fast proton transfer from water dissociation, whereas NiSA/pCNs without NiO preferentially follow the LH mechanism through surface&#8208;adsorbed *H intermediates from interfacial transferred proton. These findings establish a catalyst design principle for proton transfer control in solid&#8208;state H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;Waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylamide&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized through a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization. The resulting frameworks feature irreversible linkages, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and dual C&#9552;O/N&#9472;H coordination sites, enabling exceptional stability and highly selective gold recovery from complex electronic waste leachates.








Abstract
Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum's acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (TFB&#8208;PD&#8208;M, TFB&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C&#9552;O and N&#9472;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored in Metal Borides Enable Hydrogen Spillover for Superior Electrochemical Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides are developed as high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalysts utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. This strategy facilitates dissociation of water into *H and promotes the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface, thereby synergistically reducing the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate represents a promising and sustainable route for valuable ammonia generation. However, a vital challenge in the nitrate reduction reaction is an insufficient supply of active hydrogen (*H) and slow kinetics at a low working potential, which result in low production efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we report the single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides as a high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalyst utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. Notably, the RuSA/np&#8208;Ni3B exhibits a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%, an NH3 yield of 30.4&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1, and an energy efficiency of 39.1% at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;atom Ru anchored in nanoporous Ni3B not only can efficiently dissociate water into *H and simultaneously promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface but also can optimize surface states of Ni3B active centers, which synergistically reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer integrating nitrate reduction reaction with furfuryl alcohol oxidation reaction achieves current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.72&#160;V with 100&#160;h stability, improving the energy efficiency and economy of the system.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereodivergent Semihydrogenation of Alkynes: Synthesis of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the synergistic catalysis of an 8&#8208;OIQ cobalt catalyst and CH3CN, a series of&#160;E&#8208; and&#160;Z&#8208;alkenes with high stereoselectivity could be synthesized in the semihydrogenation of internal alkynes. Mechanistic studies showed that the acetonitrile plays an important role in controlling isomerization and inhabiting over&#8208;hydrogenation during the conversion process.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes is one of the most efficient, sustainable, and environmental&#8208;friendly strategies for accessing stereoisomerically pure olefins. Herein, we report a tridentate nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand (8&#8208;OIQ) promoted cobalt&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent semihydrogenation of internal alkynes; a series of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;alkenes could be synthesized with high stereoselectivity. Besides, this protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and operates under mild reaction conditions (1&#160;bar H2, room temperature). A preliminary mechanistic study revealed that acetonitrile plays an important role in suppressing over&#8208;reduction and controlling the stereoselectivity in this transformation.

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like on&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform that can be varied for customized applications is achieved through macrocyclic host&#8211;guest interactions. Such a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based COF with introduction of variable functional guests following the working principle of an interchangeable screwdriver. Conceptually different from traditional covalent approach, this work presents interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COF for applications through host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle&#8208;based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron&#8208;rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron&#8208;deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post&#8208;functionalization of COF through host&#8211;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano&#8208;based ligands for metal ion separation. Removing the guests enables recycling of COF, consecutive reinstallation of different guests, and continuous use for implementing expected tasks. This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on&#8208;demand interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COFs.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: In&#8208;Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 electrolysis is considered a promising strategy for producing valuable chemicals. However, it is challenging to selectively convert CO2 into long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals due to the difficulty of controlling complex C&#9472;C coupling during the reaction process. In their Research Article (e202502740), Takayoshi Ishimoto,] Miho Yamauchi et&#160;al. demonstrate the effective enhancement of in&#8208;situ Raman scattering signals by employing precisely designed electrode structures, which reveal that the crucial step in C&#9472;C coupling is the asymmetric coupling of CO and CH2, thereby advancing CO2 electroreduction to the production of long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals.

         <title>Photoelectric/Photothermal Synergy Activation in Floating Aerogel Cathode Breaks Neutral Triphase Reaction Barriers for High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Responsive Seawater Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated floating catalytic platform based on the rationally designed Janus aerogel has been explored to maximize sunlight utilization and overcome inherent kinetics/mass transport limitations of bifunctional oxygen reactions in neutral triphase systems, enabling a new class of full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery to achieve ultrahigh energy efficiency. It is unveiled that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically improve oxygen reaction kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates the adsorption energetics optimization of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Harnessing natural resources (solar, seawater) to explore next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage is an intriguing yet challenging task. Here, we establish a unique floating photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated catalytic platform based on engineered Janus aerogel that overcomes inherent mass transport/kinetics constraints in neutral triphase oxygen reaction systems to enable a full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery with ultrahigh energy efficiency. Our approach employs in situ region&#8208;selective assembly of the rationally designed fluorinated donor&#8211;acceptor polymers on carbon&#8208;nanotube aerogel (FMTAPPC), creating a new floatable FMTAPPC photoelectrode with asymmetric wettability, superior photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;response, and bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) catalysis. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration enables floating FMTAPPC to maximize sunlight utilization for interface micro&#8208;environment regulation and adsorbate binding optimization via photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activation while satisfying paradoxical wetting requirements of OER/ORR, which tunes reaction kinetics and intermediate energetics to remarkably promote both OER/ORR in neutral media. Under sunlight, floating FMTAPPC delivers large current densities for both OER/ORR&#8211;3&#8211;4 fold&#8208;enhancement over dark conditions. This enables the seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air battery to simultaneously improve charge/discharge performance at high rates and deliver ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 128.2%&#8212;surpassing most photo&#8208;assisted batteries. Mechanistic studies unveil that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically boost OER/ORR kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates intermediate energetics optimization, substantially lowering reaction energy barriers.

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ROS&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe based on FDA&#8208;approved dye was developed using a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. Benefiting from the robust tumor&#8208;targeting ability and efficient ROS response performance, the proposed probe enabled tumor detection across various mice models and allowed for precise delineation of tumor boundaries during surgical navigation, significantly reducing postoperative recurrence in situ. 








Abstract
Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin&#8208;targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (&#8764;3&#160;mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.

         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biomimetic aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino amides and benzylamines into &#945;&#8208;keto amides and aromatic aldehydes is enabled by 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), a new organocatalyst with a simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity.








Abstract
Copper amine oxidases (CAOs) catalyze aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds, which is an important biological process as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics, including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides; however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to no greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing the formation of ammonia and hydrogen byproducts.








Abstract
Cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration NO is important but suffers from low Faraday efficiency and current density because of severe competitive hydrogen and ammonia evolution reactions. Here, porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low&#8208;concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.

         <dc:description>
We propose the novel concept of the application of donor&#8211;acceptor porous aromatic framework (named as PAF&#8208;310) constructed from two types (n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type) storage blocks to accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics in potassium ion batteries, which shows the impressively electrochemical properties at room and low&#8208;temperature (even &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage mechanism.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 130.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C at 0.2 A g&#8722;1). Even at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8722; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.

Moreover, various in/ex-situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co-storage mechanism of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in PAF-310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low-temperature stabilized PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time a site&#8208;selective polymerization strategy enabling the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from identical building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. The modulator plays a dual regulatory role by enhancing the reaction reversibility and regulating the conformational flexibility of monomers, leading to the formation of 2D and 3D COFs with distinct photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional differentiation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.

         <title>Stepwise Acetylene Insertion and Ammonia Activation at a Digallene and Diindene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise insertion of acetylene into the E&#9552;E bonds of digallenes and diindenes is reported. This leads to the selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores. The six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues are Lewis&#8208;acidic and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia, which&#8212;upon heating&#8212;undergo ammonolysis releasing ethylene.








Abstract
Sequential [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between acetylene and the digallene and diindene compounds (ETer)2 (E&#160;=&#160;Ga, In; Ter&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) are described. Careful control of the reaction conditions leads to selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores, respectively. A structural analysis of the heterocycles by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests limited electronic delocalization within the rings, which is borne out in their reactivity. For example, the six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues exhibit Lewis&#8208;acidic behavior and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia. Upon heating, these adducts transform into the corresponding bimetallic triel amides with concomitant generation of ethene.

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a method to wind chiral graphene nanoribbons into either right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices, depending on the functional groups that adorn their edges. These helically wound graphene nanoribbons act as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to their chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.








Abstract
In this manuscript, we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high&#8208;yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65&#160;nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Regulating Structures and Properties of Overcrowded&#8208;Ethylene Decorated (Diaza)Phosphinines via Tunable Main&#8208;Group Element Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) with P element presented a new type of P&#8208;functionalized OCEs exhibiting the unprecedent P&#8208;hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated conformations and physical properties. The unique hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability further enabled the design of a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell P&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid, which was controlled by the P&#8208;hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;isomer and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;isomer.








Abstract
Creating more sophisticated molecular systems that are responsive, dynamic, and controllable through a combination of chemical structure modification and external stimuli represents a pivotal challenge in the development of functional molecular machines. Herein, we report a new series of overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) decorated (diaza)phosphinines. Combining with the main&#8208;group element and nonplanar OCE structures, new P&#8208;molecules showed the tunable folded(F)/twisted(T)&#8208;conformations and physical properties via the distinct P&#8208;hyperconjugation of the P&#9472;C and P&#9472;N bonds. Such hyperconjugation&#8208;induced tunability is different from the classical OCEs where p&#8208;&#960;/&#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation effects are the dominating factors controlling the structures and properties. Furthermore, bromination of NP&#8208;oxide derivative induced an unexpected chemochromic T&#8594;F isomerization, highlighting the dynamic conformation character. Leveraging on the different structures, CP and NP derivatives further enabled the formations of radical cations and anions having different spin characters on the P&#8208;centers. As the new example of P&#8208;Thiele's hydrocarbon family, combining the NP structure with the overcrowded anthraquinodimethane structure yielded a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell NP&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid with a triplet ground state, which was influenced by the PN hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;conformation and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;conformation. Overall, our new strategy, namely the hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability, paves the way toward complex organic materials with tunable the structures and physical properties.

Here, an atom&#8208;economic, high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route for &#936;TP synthesis is presented. A new chemoenzymatic route for m1&#936;TP synthesis was developed. The method offers enhanced reaction efficiency and sustainability compared to pure chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are critical monomer building blocks of mRNA therapeutics, yet efficient, scalable methods of their synthesis from readily accessible substrates remain underdeveloped. m1&#936;TP is a major cost factor of production of the current COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. We herein report a notably atom&#8208;economic and high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route toward &#936;TP and present two chemoenzymatic routes for producing m1&#936;TP at &#8764;200&#160;mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivered &#936;MP or &#936; in high yields. Acetonide&#8208;protected &#936;MP was selectively N1&#8208;methylated using dimethyl sulfate and subsequently converted to the triphosphate through efficient kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate kinase was shown for ATP&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of m1&#936;MP to m1&#936;DP and m1&#936;TP synthesis was catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase which also served to regenerate ATP by acetyl phosphate. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced &#936; into m1&#936;TP, the novel chemoenzymatic route from &#936;MP offered improved metrics of reaction efficiency and sustainability. The synthetic &#936;TP and m1&#936;TP replaced UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C&#9472;C coupling and phosphorylation toward an efficient preparation of m1&#936;TP.

         <title>Origin of Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures in Siloxane Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane electrolytes exhibit anion&#8208;rich solvation structures due to their large steric hindrance. The lower Pauli repulsion of Si&#9472;O bond compared to C&#9472;O bond leads to higher intrinsic stability than corresponding ethers.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high&#8208;voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental characterizations. Siloxane electrolytes have been demonstrated to deliver anion&#8208;rich solvation structures, which are induced by weak Li ion (Li+)&#8211;solvent interactions and strong Li+&#8211;anion interactions. The silicon (Si)&#9472;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than that of carbon (C)&#9472;O of C&#8208;siloxane (replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#9472;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability. This work reveals the mechanism of interfacial stability and intrinsic stability of siloxane electrolytes, providing a theoretical basis for the practical application of siloxane electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adapting Lattice Respiration Enabled by Crystal Design and d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Toward Highly Stable Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the dual considerations of crystal structure and electronic structure, we construct cathodes with &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration (SALR)&#8221; effect. The effect effectively addresses the poor cycle stability of transition metal&#8208;based RABs cathodes caused by the strong electrostatic interaction between high charge density Al3+ and host lattice. 








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the appealing three&#8208;electron transfer feature, low cost, and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new&#8208;type FeWO4 cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The 3D open framework and strong W&#9472;O covalent network of the FeWO4 greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al3+. Moreover, the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al3+). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as&#8208;prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect. Specifically, the reversible W&#8211;O bond elongation/compression (&#916;d&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.05&#160;&#197;) during cycling reduces lattice strain and confines volume expansion to less than 3%. As results, the FeWO4 cathode delivers a high capacity of 192&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and long cycle life of over 2300 cycles with quiet low capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle in RABs.

         <title>Mechanoactivated Celite as a Catalyst for C&#8210;H Bond Perfluoroalkylation and Other Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenic materials naturally containing trace metals such as Celite or diatomaceous earth promote practical perfluoroalkylation of C&#9472;H bonds of (hetero)arenes and a double bond bromination with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide upon mechanoactivation via ball milling. This conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids beyond piezoelectric materials. This approach poses an advancement towards sustainable processes, as it demonstrates the new application of non&#8208;toxic, untreated biominerals.








Abstract
Herein, we report that Celite (diatomaceous earth) commonly viewed as an innocent filter aid or support material, or Earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic metal oxides are efficient mechanoactivated catalysts for arene and heteroarene C&#9472;H bond radical trifluoromethylation and pentafluoroethylation, with the activity comparable with previously reported mechanochemical methods utilizing piezoelectric materials. Celite was also applied for mechanochemical dibromination of a double bond with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, eliminating the need to use of lithium titanate as a piezoelectric mechanoredox catalyst. Mechanoactivation via ball milling in the presence of minimal amount of solvent was crucial to observe the reactivity, while sonication or using a pre&#8208;ground suspension in a bulk solvent were not efficient. The EDX studies and comparison with individual metal oxides suggest a possible role of trace metal oxides in mechanoinduced reactivity. Celite could be recycled and reused several times without significant loss of activity. This approach offers environmentally benign, biocompatible and inexpensive nature&#8208;inspired materials as efficient mechanocatalyts and conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids to the materials previously deemed inert.

         <title>Regioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H3CP contributes to sustainable synthesis by integrating regioselective enzymatic halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, and enzymatic hydrolysis. TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M micelles enable the Pd&#8208;catalyzed step, allowing seamless compatibility with enzymatic reactions in one vessel under aqueous conditions. Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.








Abstract
The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.

Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of bio- and chemo-catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often-high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo-enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo-enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;alogenation, chemo-catalytic &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;eck coupling, and an enzyme-catalyzed &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;ydrolysis reaction (H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CP) in a single reaction vessel. H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross-coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super-molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS-705-M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal-catalyzed cross-coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Tailored Molybdenum&#8211;Nickel Catalyst Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation and Suppresses Parasitic Oxygen Reduction for Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;tailored MoNi4 alloyed catalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) showing high hydrogen oxidation activity but low oxygen reduction activity in alkali has been developed. Such dual functionality tackles the issue of reverse&#8208;current decay&#8212;the harmful potential jump from parasitic anodic oxygen reduction during startup/shutdown events. When integrating into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell, this catalyst demonstrates superior corrosion resistance and durability compared with the Pt/C counterpart over repeated startup/shutdown cycles.








Abstract
Numerous existing strategies struggle to mitigate reverse&#8208;current decay (RCD) during startup and shutdown in polymer electrolyte fuel cells to avoid cathode corrosion, but the added system complexity and cost are drawbacks. Here, we report that modification of a molybdenum&#8211;nickel alloy through the doping of copper enables a non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst (MoNi3.6Cu0.4) that efficiently catalyzes hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) while catalytically inactive toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, making it ideal for fuel&#8208;cell anode because the instantaneous interfacial potential jump originated from the parasitic ORR during device startup/shutdown can be surmounted. The catalyst, when assembled in the anode of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, manifests substantially improved corrosion&#8208;resistant ability compared with that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt/C) catalyst. The basis for the achieved performances reveals to be the copper dopants that increase the hydrogen bonding of interfacial water for enhanced HOR, yet weaken molecular oxygen adsorption while stabilizing hydroxyl adsorption for ORR suppression.

         <title>Engineered C&#8211;N Lyases for Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EDDS lyase was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final mutant, EDDS lyase CEA, accepts various N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines derivatives, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids, as well as several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines, producing N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids.








Abstract
Optically pure N&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acids are valuable chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and agrochemicals. Ethylenediamine&#8208;N,N&#8208;disuccinic acid lyase from Chelativorans sp. BNC1 catalyzes the addition of a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic primary amines to fumarate, producing the corresponding enantioenriched N&#8208;substituted L&#8208;aspartic acids. In this work, the enzyme was subjected to iterative cycles of site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis and screened for increased activity for the addition of 2&#8208;((methylamino)methyl)aniline to fumarate. The final variant displayed an activity of three orders of magnitude higher compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Unexpectedly, the enzyme catalyzed the hydroamination of fumarate with the aliphatic secondary amine of the starting substrate, rather than with the aromatic primary amine, leading to the formation of a tertiary amine. Exploring the substrate scope showed that the enzyme accepts various substituted N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenylmethanamines for the hydroamination of fumarate, yielding N,N&#8208;disubstituted L&#8208;aspartic acids in high optical purity (up to &gt;99% ee). Furthermore, we showed that the enzyme accepts several ortho&#8208;substituted anilines that were previously not accepted by the wild&#8208;type enzyme, yielding the corresponding N&#8208;arylated L&#8208;aspartic acids in high enantiomeric excess (&gt;99% ee). This serendipitous finding enables a new strategy for the biocatalytic synthesis of tertiary amines, unlocked within the C&#8208;N lyase toolbox.

         <title>A 3.8&#160;V Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery Enabled by a Conjugated Ladder Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a conjugated ladder polymer, poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), as an efficient anode material to store NR4+, and construct a record&#8208;high voltage 3.8&#160;V NR4+&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) by matching the BBL anode with a graphite cathode. The resultant DIB shows a maximum energy/power density up to 232&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1/6865&#160;W kg&#8722;1 based on graphite mass, superior rate performance, and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on nonmetal charge carriers like NH4+ recently have attracted intensive attention due to high safety, environmental friendliness, low cost, and fast kinetics. However, NH4+ electrolytes suffer from a narrow electrochemical potential window, making it challenging to construct high&#8208;voltage and energy&#8208;dense devices. Here we report a quaternary ammonium (NR4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) working at a high voltage of 3.8&#160;V, which was enabled by a conjugated ladder polymer poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) anode for NR4+ storage and a graphite cathode for anion uptake. The BBL functions as an efficient NR4+ host by carbonyl/enol transformation, delivering a high capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1, low average potential, high stability, and excellent rate performance. In the redox process, the electronic and ionic conductivities of BBL change periodically, accompanied by the formation of radical anion (&#9679;&#8722;) and diradical dianion (2&#9679;&#8722;). In combination with an anion&#8208;intercalation graphite cathode, the assembled graphite//BBL DIB exhibits a maximum energy/power density up to 232&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 6865&#160;W kg&#8722;1 based on mass of graphite, superior rate performance, and high cycling stability without capacity attenuation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of NR4+ as cation carrier and its efficient host, which will inspire novel designs for high&#8208;performance nonmetallic energy storage devices.

         <title>Redirecting the Peptide Cleavage Causes Protease Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine proteases catalyze substrate cleavage by a two&#8208;step acyl transfer mechanism. Newly designed peptidic inhibitors of human cathepsin B with N&#8208;terminal carbamate warheads undergo a redirected cleavage and generate non&#8208;canonical covalent complexes. Representatives of this chemotype exhibit second order rate constants of inactivation greater than 10&#160;000&#160;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Cysteine and serine proteases cleave peptides through covalent catalysis by generating a transient adduct with the N&#8208;terminal part of the substrate after releasing its C&#8208;terminal part. We demonstrate the unique redirection of this event leading to strong enzyme inactivation. For targeting human cathepsin B, a cysteine protease of significant therapeutic importance, we designed tailored peptidomimetics with a variety of dipeptide fragments directed toward the occluding loop and equipped with numerous N&#8208;terminal carbamate warheads. The carbamate deprotonation catalyzed by the active site thiolate initiates the redirected cleavage. The C&#8208;terminal part of the inhibitors remains covalently attached to the protease. Hydrolysis of such carbamoyl&#8208;enzyme complexes is catalytically unsupported rendering inhibition irreversible. This novel mechanism of action comprises a significant extension of the covalent drug space.

For targeting human cathepsin B, a cysteine protease of significant therapeutic importance, we designed tailored peptidomimetics with a variety of dipeptide fragments directed toward the occluding loop and equipped with numerous N-terminal carbamate warheads. The carbamate deprotonation catalyzed by the active site thiolate initiates the redirected cleavage. The C-terminal part of the inhibitors remains covalently attached to the protease. Hydrolysis of such carbamoyl-enzyme complexes is catalytically unsupported rendering inhibition irreversible. This novel mechanism of action comprises a significant extension of the covalent drug space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conditional Stabilization of the Hypoxia&#8208;Inducible Factor HIF1&#945;&#8212; Photoswitchable Stapled Peptides Prevent Elongin BC&#8211;Mediated Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light photoswitchable peptides enable the stabilization of the hydroxylated hypoxia transcription factor 1&#945; (HIF1&#945;&#8212;OH) by targeting the pVHL&#8208;EloBC interaction. Significant differences in conformation, binding, and transcription of HIF&#8208;targeted genes between the photostationary states (PSS) were demonstrated.








Abstract
Oxygen levels and its distribution are tightly regulated due to their critical impact on health. Hypoxia&#8208;inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1&#945;&#8208;target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PSB&#8208;BCB&#8208;04 stabilized HIF1&#945; under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC (ki&#160; = &#160;7.9&#160;&#177;&#160;1.3&#160;nM) and preventing VHL&#8208;mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a sevenfold difference in its EloBC&#8208;binding capacity. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1&#945; degradation enabled isomer&#8208;specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1&#945; and provided a new toolbox for on&#8208;demand photocontrol over the HIF&#8208;signaling pathway as well as VHL&#8208;mediated degradation.

         <title>Intriguing Reactivity of a 1,2&#8208;Dihydrodialumane Towards Organic Azides &#8211; From a Terminal Diazido&#8211;Dialumane to Pendulum&#8208;Clock&#8208;Like Azide Bridging</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of a dihydro&#8208;dialane supported by a hybrid ligand (DNI) with organic azides yields structurally diverse aluminium species, including the first example of low oxidation state aluminium azide complex, a diazido&#8208;dialane, along with an aluminium&#8208;tetrazole, and azide alumination. Spectroscopic studies reveal dynamic behaviour in solution, featuring a pendulum&#8208;clock&#8208;like motion of the benzyl azide and N&#945; oscillation within the complex.








Abstract
The reactivity of dihydro&#8208;dialane with organic azides is described. Treatment of the hybrid ligand&#8208;based dialane [(DNI{H}Al)2] (I) (DNI&#160;=&#160;[3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline)ethenyl]&#8208;3H&#8208;indolenine) with TMSN3 (TMS&#160;=&#160;trimethylsilyl) at room temperature gives the first diazido&#8208;dialane [(DNI{N3}Al)2] (1). The transformation from here to a more stable aluminium&#8208;tetrazole [DNIAl(NTMS)2N2] (2) is established. The reaction of other RN3 gives [(DNI{H}Al)2(&#954;2&#8208;N3R)] (R&#160;=&#160;Benzyl in 3 and 1&#8208;Adamantyl in 4) with the azide in a &#956;&#8208;bridging position between two aluminium atoms. Using 1H NOESY/EXSY NMR spectroscopy, a positional exchange of the two TMS groups (2) via rotation of the tetrazole unit is observed. In contrast, compound 3 exhibits a pendulum&#8208;clock&#8208;like dynamic, with N&#945; oscillating between the two aluminium atoms in solution. The reaction of dialane I with DippN3 (Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3) gives the dialuminium amine&#160;[{DNI(H)Al}2(&#956;&#8208;NDipp)] (5).

         <title>Tuning Eley&#8211;Rideal Mechanism in Electrochemical Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ER mechanism plays a vital role in electrocatalytic hydrogenation, yet its rate&#8208;limiting factors remain poorly understood. Using acetylene hydrogenation as a model, we uncover atomic activation and spatial hindrance as key ER bottlenecks. Cu3Au, with balanced adsorption strength, exemplifies how introducing weak&#8208;binding atoms into moderate&#8208;binding hosts can optimize ER activity.








Abstract
The Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER) mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, which rely heavily on the interaction between solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;phase species. In this study, we examine the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene to explore the factors influencing the ER mechanism. We employed the density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the hydrogenation of acetylene on face&#8208;centered cubic metals and copper&#8208;based alloys. Microkinetic modeling identifies changes in the rate&#8208;determining steps of different alloys as electronegativity decreases. We then constructed the volcano plot for the adsorption energy toward C2H2 and the reaction rate, which predicted that Cu3Au is the best candidate alloy for the C2H2 semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Both extensive prior research and our experimental findings validated our volcano plot. Notably, our work points out the two key determinants of the ER mechanism: atomic activation and steric hindrance. For metals with weaker adsorption, steric hindrance primarily obstructs the ER mechanism, while for metals with stronger adsorption, the ER mechanism is hindered due to the challenge of atomic activation. Therefore, introducing weak adsorption sites into moderately adsorptive metals can improve the overall efficiency of the ER reaction by balancing these two factors.

         <title>Complex Donuts: Small Variations in DNA Sequence Dictate Pathway Complexity in DNA Nanotoroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical information encoded in the sequence of DNA amphiphiles enables the selective formation of kinetically trapped DNA nanotoroids through a complex self&#8208;assembly pathway. The toroids are formed as on&#8208;pathway structures via a competitive mechanism only when a toroid&#8208;selective DNA sequence is used.








Abstract
The formation of higher&#8208;order structures in natural biopolymers, such as polypeptides and nucleic acids, is governed by sequence specificity and monomer chemistry. Although nucleic acids can assemble into programmable nanostructures through base&#8208;pairing interactions, their chemical diversity is limited to four nucleobases. DNA amphiphiles overcome this limitation by introducing orthogonal interactions through non&#8208;nucleosidic modifications. These amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies, such as spheres, fibers, or sheets, with closely packed, parallel DNA strands on their exterior. This unusual arrangement can give rise to emergent properties absent in simple DNA strands. Here, we show that the precise sequence of single&#8208;stranded DNA, independent of double helix base&#8208;pairing, can be used to program the self&#8208;assembled morphology of DNA amphiphiles. Remarkably, small sequence variations can drive the formation of nonequilibrium DNA nanotoroids, rather than conventional morphologies. The DNA nanotoroids were formed as on&#8208;pathway structures via a competitive mechanism, only when a toroid&#8208;selective DNA sequence was used. They could be stabilized noncovalently by a small molecule cross&#8208;linker or coassembly with a secondary DNA amphiphile. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the dependence of toroid formation on the structure of the end &#960;&#8208;stacking unit. This work introduces a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanotoroid materials with assembly properties controlled by unique sequences, akin to proteins, for applications in cell delivery, nanofiltration, nanoreactors, and materials templation.

         <title>Selective Nanopore Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A and B in a Single Sample</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a nanopore&#8208;based sensing strategy for ultrasensitive and selective detection of MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B. Utilizing enzyme&#8208;specific peptide transformations and &#945;&#8208;hemolysin nanopores with cucurbit[7]uril, our method achieves picomolar detection, real&#8208;time analysis, and high specificity in cellular and tissue samples, offering a powerful tool for neurological research, diagnostics, and drug screening.








Abstract
Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B) are key enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and are critical biomarkers for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Here, we present a highly sensitive nanopore&#8208;based method for the selective detection and quantification of MAO&#8208;A and MAO&#8208;B using specifically designed peptide probes. These probes undergo enzyme&#8208;specific oxidation, generating distinct nanopore translocation signatures that enable precise identification. Our method achieves picomolar&#8208;level detection, outperforming conventional assays such as ELISA. Importantly, we demonstrate its applicability in complex biological samples, including cell lysates (SH&#8208;SY5Y and HepG2) and mouse brain and liver tissues, with results strongly correlating with ELISA. The ability to selectively detect both enzymes within a single sample highlights its advantage in studying enzyme interplay in biological systems. This label&#8208;free, real&#8208;time approach offers a powerful tool for biomedical research, disease diagnostics, and drug screening, with potential for expanding to other clinically relevant enzymes.

         <title>Redox&#8208; and NIR&#8208;Active Iron(III) Triradicals as Catalysts for Radical Polymerization of Acrylamides and Methacrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complex was isolated in good yield and utilized as a catalyst for radical polymerization of acrylamides and methacrylates at ambient conditions.








Abstract
Two unprecedented redox&#8208;active, low&#8208;spin Fe(III)&#8208;triradical complexes, [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3]&#183;NHC&#9552;S (1&#183;NHC&#9552;S; E&#9552;S) and [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;Se&#8226;&#8722;)3] (2; E&#9552;Se) have been synthesized and structurally characterized by SCXRD. They were further characterized spectroscopically using IR, Raman, EPR, and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. The low&#8208;spin electronic configuration of the central Fe(III) ion (1) and the nature of the magnetic interaction between the Fe(III) center and the three unpaired electrons in 1 have been investigated by magnetic measurements. In addition, the bonding stability and electron density distribution in 1 were studied by quantum chemical calculations and correlated with experimental results. Finally, a series of well&#8208;defined functional homopolymers were synthesized via catalytic polymerization reactions using [Fe(III)(SS&#8208;NHC&#9552;S&#8226;&#8722;)3] (1) as a catalyst at ambient temperature. These reactions yielded poly(N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA), poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), and poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) with low dispersities ranging from 1.2 to 1.22. The successful synthesis of various diblock copolymers confirmed excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity of the synthesized homopolymers. These homopolymers and diblock copolymers highlight the versatile catalytic polymerization reactions of these Fe&#8208;radical complexes. Herein, we present a report on the polymerization of various acrylamides and methacrylates using a redox&#8208;active Fe&#8208;dithiolene complex for the first time.

         <title>Engineering Neural Stem Cells with Micropatches for Improved Therapy of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) holds promise for repairing traumatic brain injury (TBI) but their therapeutic performance is hindered due to the low efficient differentiation into neurons. Direct injection of differentiation modulators to the lesion site has limited improvement to neuronal differentiation as they tend to diffuse or be degraded. In the present study, we report a simple and versatile strategy to engineer the NSCs with a micropatch to improve their therapeutic performance in TBI treatment. The micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing technique and can adhere to the membrane with negligible detachment or internalization within 14 days after surface moficiation. The micropatches on the cell membrane can move together with stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid, a neuronal differentiation modulator, to regulate the surrounding microenvironment of NSCs, improving their neuronal differentiation rate from 28.0% to 54.2%. The micropatches&#8208;engineered NSCs can be implanted to the injured brain tissue through a minimally invasive microinjection approach and show outperformance in repairing damaged neural tissue of TBI mice compared to normal stem cells. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway to engineer stem cells and holds great potential in nerve regeneration and neurodegenerative diseases treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Encodable Tetrazine Chemistry for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioorthogonal Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using genetic code expansion (GCE) to encode bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a promising method for protein labeling, both in vitro and within cells. Here, we demonstrate that tetrazine (Tet) amino acids incorporated into proteins are highly tunable and have extraordinary potential for fast and quantitative bioorthogonal ligations. We describe the synthesis and characterization of reaction rates for 29 Tet amino acids (20 of which are new) and compare their encoding ability into proteins using evolved tRNA/RS pairs. For these systems, we characterized on&#8208;protein Tet stability, reaction rates, and ligation extents, as the utility of a bioorthogonal labeling group depends on its stability and reactivity when encoded into proteins. By integrating data on encoding efficiency, selectivity, on&#8208;protein stability, and in&#8208;cell labeling for Tet tRNA/RS pairs, we developed the smallest, fastest, and most stable Tet to date. This was achieved by introducing fluorine substituents to Tet4, resulting in reaction rates at the 10&#8310; M&#8315;&#185;s&#8315;&#185; level while minimizing degradation. This study expands the toolbox of bioorthogonal reagents for Tet&#8208;sTCO&#8208;based, site&#8208;specific protein labeling and demonstrates that the Tet is a uniquely tunable, highly reactive, and encodable bioorthogonal functional group. These findings provide a foundation to further explore Tet encoding and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Halide Segregation of Wide Bandgap Perovskite by Interface Molecular Coordination for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transporting layer made by self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs)&#160;are emerging as promising hole transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells, owing to their reduced parasitic absorption and effective carrier extraction. However, perovskite films grown on HTMs substrates typically exhibit a high defect density, which adversely affects device performance. In this study, we investigated the film growth kinetics of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite on monolayer materials substrates and uncovered a halide phase segregation in initial nucleation stage during crystal growth kinetics at the interface, which brings small grain sizes and significant lattice strain within the perovskite film.&#160;To address this issue, we introduced a biphosphate&#8208;substituted molecule on the HTMs surface to coordinate with PbBr2 that suppresses halide phase segregation, leading to improved crystallographic orientation and a reduction in defect density. As a result, the wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77 eV) perovskite solar cells achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.35 V, while tandem devices reached an impressive efficiency of 28.65%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nondestructive Patterning of Upconverting and Down&#8208;Shifting Luminescent Nanoparticles for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro&#8208; and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid&#8208;state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three&#8208;armed diazo crosslinker (3G) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18 mJ/cm2, in stark contrast to 200&#8722;500 mJ/cm2 for diazirine&#8208;based crosslinkers) required for crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G, and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G&#8208;based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi&#8208;layer structures for dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system&#8208;level devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Nickel&#8208;Interlocked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Catalyst for Photocatalytic Aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (  Ni@COF1  ) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (  Ni@COF1R  ),  Ni@COF1  exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late&#8208;stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin&#8208;linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of Alkyl gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Construct Carbon and Silicon Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increased encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) compared to TRAP and demonstrates improved uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is injected into mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and fit to a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model. NIR&#8208;TMPA demonstrates prolonged short&#8208;phase half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control with similar slow&#8208;phase half&#8208;life, leading to an increased area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve clearance and pointing to its sequestration in the tumor site. Endpoint fluorescence analysis of mouse organs ex vivo also supports this conclusion. TMPA and its future derivatives therefore bear potential for targeted treatment of GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Nitride&#8208;chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High Performance All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial for advancing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free nature, which facilitates intimate solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact and uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen&#8208;chlorine dual&#8208;anion framework, formulated as Li3x+0.1ZrNxCl4.1, for high&#8208;voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li2ZrCl6 with a triclinic structure, increased N3&#8722; substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li+ conductivity from 0.46 mS cm&#8722;1 to 3.01 mS cm&#8722;1, alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8 V. This dual&#8208;anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high&#8208;energy LiNi0.83Co0.06Mn0.11O2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.5 V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability exceeding 3,000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50 &#8239;&#176;C) and higher cut&#8208;off voltages (up to 4.8 V). These results highlight the promise of dual&#8208;anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next&#8208;generation SSEs beyond traditional single&#8208;anion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Blocking Strategy Boosts H2S Tolerance in Platinum&#8208;Based Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) show great potential for energy conversion, but their platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts are easily and irreversibly poisoned by trace impurities like H2S, causing performance degradation with unclear mechanisms. Here, combining in situ Raman spectroscopy with theoretical calculations, we found that on pure Pt surfaces, H2S dissociate into S* and HS* intermediates that occupy active sites of continuous Pt atoms in an acidic solution under 50 ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere. However, on PtRu alloy surfaces, while *OH species were observed on Ru sites, no sulfur&#8208;containing species were detected on Pt sites. Comparative experiments revealed that the sulfur&#8208;related Raman peaks of PtRu exhibited a redshift compared to Pt, indicating that Ru alloying weakens the *S adsorption on Pt sites through electronic effects. These results demonstrate that Ru not only creates discontinuous Pt sites to block sulfur adsorption but also significantly weakens sulfur binding through electronic modulation. Based on these insights, small&#8208;sized site&#8208;blocking PtRu/C catalysts&#160;were developed, exhibiting only 9.2% activity decay after 700 s in 50 ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere, a 4.3&#8208;fold improvement over commercial Pt/C catalysts (39.3% decay). This work provides fundamental understanding of H2S poisoning mechanisms and practical guidelines for designing robust, poison&#8208;resistant&#160;catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Lanthanide&#8208;Based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Multimode Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and upconversion luminescence under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+, Tb3+, or Eu3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.








Abstract
Luminescent 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of metal&#8208;organic framework materials expanded in a 2D plane, which have a wide range of applications in fields of optoelectronic devices, sensors, and information storage due to their unique layered structure and excellent optical properties. Currently, research on luminescent 2D MOFs mainly focuses on down&#8208;shifting luminescence, while the exploration of upconversion luminescence remains in its early stages. Herein, a novel 2D Yb&#8208;PMA MOFs were synthesized, and red upconversion luminescence at 660 nm under 980&#160;nm excitation was successfully achieved by introducing Ho3+ as the luminescence center and using Yb3+ as the sensitizer. In addition, multimode emitting MOFs with both upconversion and down&#8208;shifting luminescence were further constructed by codoping Tb3+ or Eu3+. Inspired by the layered structure of 2D materials, multilayer stacked 2D MOFs composites were prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation method and upconversion luminescence was realized for the first time by interfacial energy transfer between different components. This strategy not only expands the optical modulation of luminescent 2D MOFs, but also provides new ideas for the construction of multifunctional luminescent materials. The upconversion/down&#8208;shifting luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based 2D MOFs designed in this work show good potential for application in the field of information encryption.

         <title>Universal Chemical Presodiation under Air Condition for Highly Stable Na&#8208;deficient Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered transition&#8208;metal oxides have attracted growing attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), however, their application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to Na&#8208;deficiency and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. Herein, a universal chemical presodiation pathway is reported with Na&#8208;bipyridine dissolved in diethyl ether (Na&#8208;Bpy/DEE) for stable Na&#8208;deficient P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) electrode under air condition. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;functional groups of Bpy&#8226;&#8208; radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na+ from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF&#8208;rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g&#8208;1, and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles. This work proposes an industrially feasible presodiation strategy to highly efficient SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Homobimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Cobalt Catalyst for the Methanolysis of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (1) has shown excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, surpassing the related bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)(PMe2Ph)(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (2), the Co(II) complex [Co(Cl)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)] (3), and the Co(I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)]Cl (4). A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#8211;H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PNHP ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si&#8211;H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(&#8211;I) centers. Then, the PhSiH2 group at the Co(&#8211;I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ cation, regenerating the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; species. [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH&#8208;assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Polymerization of n&#8208;Doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)  Using Parts Per Million (ppm) Level of Molybdenum Trioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n&#8208;PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO&#8322;&#8208;catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO&#8323;)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of n&#8208;PBDF. Remarkably, MoO&#8323; at parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) concentrations achieves near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion (&gt;99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain&#8208;growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO&#8323; mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This breakthrough not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;cost route to high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction as a Mechanistic Probe for Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to alter reaction kinetics. Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed&#8208;width cavities and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C=C bond. In all cases, no changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversing Blocking Order of Trithiocarbonate&#8208;Mediated RAFT Polymerizations Using Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylic&#8208;methacrylic block copolymers have limited accessibility due to monomer order requirements in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques leading to a vast landscape of block copolymers being understudied. Using unique PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization conditions, a controlled chain extension of poly(methyl acrylate) with methyl methacrylate could be performed resulting in a high&#8208;molecular weight thermoplastic elastomer.








Abstract
Many acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymer sequences remain inaccessible due to synthetic limitations. Herein, photoinduced electron/energy transfer (PET) catalysis is leveraged to reverse blocking order limitations in trithiocarbonate (TTC)&#8208;mediated reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We synthesized poly(methyl acrylate&#8208;b&#8208;methyl methacrylate) by PET&#8208;RAFT using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3, achieving predictable, linear increases in molecular weight with conversion. Kinetics studies showed that adding a tertiary amine (triethanolamine) introduced a reversible redox reaction to stabilize the TTC radical during chain extensions, leading to more uniform block copolymers (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.47) compared to block copolymers synthesized without amine (&#208;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.56). To highlight the utility of this method, triblock copolymers of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks were investigated. The order of acrylic and methacrylic blocks impacted the physical properties of compositionally similar polymeric materials. For example, a high molecular weight triblock copolymer (P(MMA&#8208;b&#8208;MA&#8208;b&#8208;MMA), Mn&#160;=&#160;564&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) thermoplastic elastomer showed exceptional strain (&gt;1600%). Overall, we report (i) a new methodology to unlock synthetic access to acrylic&#8211;methacrylic block copolymers using TTCs and photocatalysis, (ii) insight into photocatalyst&#8208;mediated radical polymerization, and (iii) synthesis of new high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Boosts the Uptake of Small Molecules in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in improving the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. The uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells through macropinocytosis pathway.








Abstract
Chalcogen bonding, a noncovalent interaction between the chalcogen atom (S, Se, and Te) and Lewis base, plays crucial roles in catalysis, anion recognition, protein confirmation, enzyme activity, and drug design. Herein, we show that chalcogen bonding can be used as a driving force to enhance the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. A systematic investigation using several chalcogen&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules reveal that the cellular uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells. This study suggests that the biological activities of chalcogen&#8208;based compounds may depend not only on their chemical reactivity but also on their chalcogen bond forming ability with the cell membrane.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Red Algal Diterpene Peyssonnosol in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpene synthases derived from Anaerolineae bacteria catalyse the biosynthesis of peyssonnosene&#8208;type diterpenes from red algae. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis enabled a partial functional switch, resulting in the formation of additional byproducts. The intricate cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
Two diterpene synthases (DTSs) for peyssonnosol and peyssonnosol B were discovered in bacteria. Their enzyme mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, yielding biosynthetically related molecules that gave important insights into the terpene cyclisation cascade. In the present case, several mechanisms in line with the isotopic labelling experiments could be formulated. Only an extended experimental approach in combination with computational chemistry ultimately resulted in a refined mechanistic model.

         <title>Communicative Nanomotors Reprogram Cancer Cell Death via Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communicative nanomotors respond to elevated ROS in the tumor microenvironment, enabling active communication and selective mitochondrial targeting through non&#8208;covalent surface engineering. Their precise interaction with cells induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and pyroptotic cell death, while chemotactic motility ensures deeper tumor penetration, advancing intelligent cancer therapeutics.








Abstract
Nanomotors offer significant advantages over passive nanoparticles in biomedical applications. However, their potential has been largely restricted to cargo transport, with limited capacity for interaction with biological systems. Here, we present next&#8208;generation self&#8208;assembled nanomotors that not only exhibit chemotactic motility but also actively communicate with cells, reprogramming cell fate by inducing pyroptosis. These nanomotors are designed to respond to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment, triggering nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;driven propulsion and selective mitochondria targeting via triphenylphosphine (TPP) surface engineering. This interaction induces mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release, and activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Furthermore, their chemotactic motility facilitates deeper tumor tissue penetration in 3D spheroids, demonstrating their ability to navigate physiological barriers. By shifting the paradigm from motility&#8208;driven to interactive nanomedicine, this study establishes a transformative platform for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Amide Chemistry Enables Redox Locking of Cyclic Disulfides for Polypeptide Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of a family of cyclic dichalcogenides derived from cysteine is significantly enhanced against reductants upon acylation of the alpha&#8208;amino group. Amide formation serves as a redox lock, offering a mechanism to achieve selectivity in the assembly of large cyclic polypeptides on a water&#8208;compatible solid support.








Abstract
A practical strategy in synthetic organic chemistry for shutting down temporarily the nucleophilicity of thiols is to exploit their redox properties by converting them into disulfides. The stability of such a thiol protection in reductive medium can be sensitive to microenvironmental changes, including chemical modifications occurring nearby. Although difficult to achieve, large shifts in disulfide stability might provide a practical mean for bringing selectivity in a reacting system comprising multiple thiol functionalities. Here we report that the stability of a cyclic disulfide increases dramatically upon acylation of an amino group placed in the vicinity of the S&#9472;S bond. The gain in stability is so pronounced that the amide bond formation acts as a redox lock. We describe the application of such a redox switch to the chemoselective assembly of polypeptides by thiol&#8208;based peptide ligation chemistries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical strategy in synthetic organic chemistry for shutting down temporarily the nucleophilicity of thiols is to exploit their redox properties by converting them into disulfides. The stability of such a thiol protection in reductive medium can be sensitive to microenvironmental changes, including chemical modifications occurring nearby. Although difficult to achieve, large shifts in disulfide stability might provide a practical mean for bringing selectivity in a reacting system comprising multiple thiol functionalities. Here we report that the stability of a cyclic disulfide increases dramatically upon acylation of an amino group placed in the vicinity of the S&#9472;S bond. The gain in stability is so pronounced that the amide bond formation acts as a redox lock. We describe the application of such a redox switch to the chemoselective assembly of polypeptides by thiol-based peptide ligation chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study introduces an N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit&#8208;based strategy to enhance room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), highlighting that 1,1&#8208;DB shows strong RTP property, unlike its isomer 1,2&#8208;DB. The contrast in their performance aids in understanding the relationship between molecular structure and phosphorescence, offering insights for designing and optimizing RTP materials.








Abstract
Achieving pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is of great interest due to their applications in optoelectronics. However, improving RTP in pure organic materials by controlling triplet excitons is challenging due to their complex relaxation processes. Therefore, exploring effective strategies to modulate triplet excitons is crucial. Herein, we propose a N&#9472;B&#9472;N isomerization strategy to enhance RTP performance. Two isomers containing HN&#9472;B&#9472;NH units (B2{1,2&#8208;(NH)2C6H4}2), namely 1,1&#8208;DB and 1,2&#8208;DB, were synthesized to explore their RTP properties. Intriguingly, 1,1&#8208;DB exhibited excellent RTP, whereas 1,2&#8208;DB displayed negligible phosphorescence. The N&#9472;B&#9472;N unit in 1,1&#8208;DB optimizes molecular configuration and interactions, enhancing electron delocalization and stabilizing triplet excitons, which improves intersystem crossing (ISC) and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) while reducing nonradiative decay, thus enabling RTP. Additionally, based on phosphorescence resonance energy transfer, multicolor afterglows were achieved by doping fluorescein into 1,1&#8208;DB. This work not only provides a new class of RTP materials but also offers valuable insights for the discovery and optimization of rational designs in RTP materials, potentially triggering the exploration of new functions and properties within boron&#8208;nitrogen molecular systems.

         <title>Technoeconomic Perspective on the Electroreduction of CO2 to Formic Acid: Scale&#8208;Up Strategies Toward Industrial Viability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current technoeconomic analysis of CO2 electroreduction to produce &#8220;green&#8221; formic acid highlights economic optimization through the implementation of multiple&#8208;cell stacking, positioning it as a competitive alternative to established industrial methods. Among the studied electrolyzer reactors, the direct formic acid production electrolyzer demonstrates enhanced viability due to the reduced costs associated with downstream processing.








Abstract
The conventional industrial synthesis of formic acid is an energy&#8208;intensive process that contributes to the CO2 footprint. As an alternative method, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to formic acid has emerged as a viable means to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and advance the energy transition to a circular, carbon&#8208;neutral economy. Despite considerable progress in this field, the scale&#8208;up of electrolyzers from laboratory prototypes to commercial&#8208;scale production remains an important challenge. Thus, this technoeconomic analysis provides a detailed evaluation of the economic viability of upscaling the electrolyzer size to an industrial level, determining whether the eCO2RR process can economically compete with the conventional industrial production of formic acid. The proposed technoeconomic assessment employs a bottom&#8208;up approach based on realistic cost models using the three most successful designs: dual flow (DF), direct formic acid production (DFAP), and zero&#8208;gap (ZG) electrolyzers. The results from this study underscore the necessity of implementing multiple&#8208;cell stacking to economically compete with established industrial processes. Among the three studied designs, DFAP and, to a certain extent, DF are promising. Although the scalability of the DFAP electrolyzer may initially appear inadequate, it holds potential for commercial application, particularly if technical improvements in the center compartment and solid&#8208;state electrolyte are materialized.

         <title>High Turnover Frequency in the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrous Oxide to Dinitrogen at a Binuclear Copper Complex of 3,5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by nitrous oxide reductase, a binuclear copper complex supported by carbon black was utilized for the electrocatalytic N&#8322;O reduction under ambient conditions. The binuclear Cu center enables exceptionally high turnover frequency and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for the electrochemical N&#8322;O reduction.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone&#8208;depleting substance. Electrocatalytic N2O reduction (e&#8208;N2ORR) is a promising approach to remove N2O from the air under ambient conditions. However, developing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free e&#8208;N2ORR electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and turnover frequency (TOF) remains a challenge because of the weak binding of N2O and the high kinetic barrier for deoxygenation reaction. In this work, inspired by the multinuclear copper active site of nitrous oxide reductases, a binuclear copper complex of 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole supported on carbon black of Ketjenblack (CuHdatrz/KB) was utilized for the e&#8208;N2ORR at pH 13 and 298&#160;K. CuHdatrz/KB achieves a high FE of&#160;&#8776;&#160;100% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for the e&#8208;N2ORR to N2 and TOF up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;700&#160;h&#8722;1, which is one&#8211;two orders of magnitude higher than those of the previously reported molecular&#8208;based catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that Cu(II) ions of CuHdatrz/KB are reduced to Cu(I) keeping the binuclear core, suggesting that the multinuclear copper active site is crucial to efficiently catalyze the e&#8208;N2ORR like the nitrous oxide reductase.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Lewis Basicity in Oxide Lattice Oxygens: A Regulating Force for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) require fast oxygen conversion kinetics to achieve good cycling performance and high energy efficiency. In the text of catalysts for LOBs, Lewis basicity of lattice oxygens (OL) in common transition metal oxides is often underestimated due to the weak electron donor characteristic of OL. In this work, a new spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxide with Lewis basicity (LB&#8208;HEO) was synthesized through a Joule&#8208;heating method. OL was activated by regulating the tetrahedral site&#8208;OL&#8208;octahedral site (MTd&#8208;OL&#8208;MOh) units in the spinel&#8208;type HEO, enhancing the Lewis basicity. Used as cathode catalyst for LOBs, LB&#8208;HEO could attract Li+ and increase the disorder in discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), promoting the delithiation process and the interfacial charge transfer at the LB&#8208;HEO|Li2O2 interface. The activation energy of interfacial charge transfer was significantly reduced from 63.5 kJ mol&#8208;1 to 22.4 kJ mol&#8208;1. As a result, low charging overpotential of 0.97 V and long cycling lifespan of 135 cycles at 100 mA g&#8208;1 were achieved with capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g&#8208;1. The strategy based on the regulation of Li+ behavior through its interaction with Lewis bases provides a promising prospective for the design of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance LOBs.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive slide&#8208;ring polymer network whose mechanical properties can be reversibly tuned through photoisomerization of incorporated azobenzene units. In the trans&#8208;state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material. UV&#8208;induced switching to the sterically demanding cis&#8208;configuration restricts ring mobility, thereby increasing the Young's modulus by two&#8208;fold while reducing toughness. Control experiments with non&#8208;interlocked analogs revealed the opposite mechanical response&#8212;light&#8208;induced softening&#8212;highlighting the pivotal role of topology in property regulation. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions. This work establishes a versatile strategy for post&#8208;synthetic topological control via molecular photoswitches, enabling the design of adaptive polymers with stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanical properties for applications in smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co,Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co,Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6+2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2+6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Transfer Learning&#8208;Assisted SERS: Predicting Molecular Identity and Concentration in Mixtures Using Pure Compound Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying and quantifying compounds in unknown mixtures represents the ultimate goal of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy but remains a significant challenge in real&#8208;world applications. Existing machine learning&#8208;driven SERS methods are limited by their reliance on prior knowledge of mixture composition, while time&#8208;consuming experimental testing of all possibilities is not feasible. We integrate the molecular specificity of SERS with an adaptive transfer learning strategy to sequentially identify and quantify carnitine components in 11 unknown binary, ternary, and quaternary multicarnitine mixtures, achieving 100% identification accuracy and a mean quantitation error of only 3%. All models are trained solely on pure compound spectral data, enabling scalable, qualitative, and quantitative analysis of complex, unseen multiplex spectra&#8212;without requiring costly and time&#8208;consuming training data collection for every possible mixture. This predictive transfer learning&#8208;driven approach marks a transformative leap for practical SERS applications, allowing accurate analysis of complex mixtures without prior knowledge of components or ratios.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Response&#160;and Self&#8208;Powered CPL Detection in Unique&#160;Triangular&#8208;Tetrahedral Chiral Copper(I)&#160;Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;coordination polyhedral architecture of Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides induces significant structural distortions,   endowing these materials with remarkable circularly polarized light (CPL) activity and exceptional nonlinear optical (NLO) performance. However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors (glum) in Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared one&#8208;dimensional chiral (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 (where MPZ is 2&#8208;methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular&#8208;tetrahedral configuration in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric cubic P1211 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH2PO4. Additionally, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and gTHG&#8208;CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG&#8208;based CPL detection in Cu(&#8544;)&#8208;based metal halides. The self&#8208;powered CPL photodetectors based on (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0 V, and further achieve self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection with excellent low&#8208;dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship in chiral organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next&#8208;generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mathematical Double&#8208;Matrix Switchable Homochiral Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homochiral ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their distinctive chiroptical effects in contrast to ordinary ferroelectrics. Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between non&#8208;zero and zero values in both second&#8208;order&#160;nonlinear optical susceptibility &#967;(2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 (BTA = 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432F2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362 K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between non&#8208;zero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both &#967;(2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG&#8208;CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432F2 phase transition enables (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase. Our findings shed light on the exploration of mathematical double&#8208;matrix switchable chiral ferroelectrics with SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Coordination&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a promising strategy for producing high&#8208;value chemical and fuel. However, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction remain a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate intermediates by the construction of halogen&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic cages (Ni8L12X4, X = Cl, Br, I). Theory calculations show that the formation of the *COOH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 and promote the production of *COOH.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a promising strategy for producing high-value chemical and fuel. However, developing high-performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction remain a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate intermediates by the construction of halogen-coordinated metal-organic cages (Ni8L12X4, X = Cl, Br, I). Theory calculations show that the formation of the *COOH intermediate is the rate-limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 and promote the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni8L12I4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 &#956;mol g-1 h-1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl-coordinated and Br-coordinated Ni MOC by 200 and 5-fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Electric Field Microenvironment&#8208;Induced Dynamic Spatial&#160;Confinement to Stabilize I+ towards High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading and Stable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four&#8208;electron iodine conversion chemistry (I&#8208;/I2/I+) endows zinc&#8208;iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high&#8208;voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8208;) on the cathode by &#8208;C&#8208;N+&#8208;induced localized electric field microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl&#8208; concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low&#8208;concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl&#8208; maintains a balance with iodine species at the &#8208;C&#8208;N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03 mg cm&#8208;2, the PDDA&#8208;I still maintains a distinct four&#8208;electron&#8208;conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm&#8208;2. An impressing lifespan of 10000 cycles is achieved at 12.6 mg cm&#8208;2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycles, exceeding conventional iodine cathode by 20&#8208;fold. This work provides an important reference for high&#8208;performance four&#8208;electron conversion zinc&#8208;iodine batteries at high iodine loading.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four-electron iodine conversion chemistry (I-/I2/I+) endows zinc-iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl-, Br-). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high-voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl-) on the cathode by -C-N+-induced localized electric field microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA-I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl- concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low-concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl- maintains a balance with iodine species at the -C-N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03 mg cm-2, the PDDA-I still maintains a distinct four-electron-conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm-2. An impressing lifespan of 10000 cycles is achieved at 12.6 mg cm-2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycles, exceeding conventional iodine cathode by 20-fold. This work provides an important reference for high-performance four-electron conversion zinc-iodine batteries at high iodine loading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Electronically Polarized Fe&#8208;N5 Catalysts Redirect Polymerization&#8208;Driven Phenolic Pollutant Removal Toward Sustainable Carbon Sequestration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sustainable strategy for simultaneous pollutant removal and carbon sequestration is offered by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;mediated electron transfer mechanism. However, it remains challenging to achieve catalysts with durable and high activity. A novel catalyst design strategy leveraging boron doping&#8208;induced long&#8208;range electronic polarization to precisely modulate PMS complexation dynamics on single&#8208;atom catalysts is proposed in this study. It is demonstrated that B&#8208;doping induces asymmetric Fe&#8208;N5 coordination at the atomic iron centers while creating electron&#8208;enriched carbon auxiliary sites. The electron distribution is synergistically optimized by this dual&#8208;site configuration through lowering the d&#8208;band center and establishing a polarized charge transfer pathway. Complexes with enhanced oxidation potential are generated by the engineered FeSA&#8208;BNC/PMS, redirecting bisphenol A degradation from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization to an interfacial polymerization pathway via outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer. Remarkably, &gt;3 times the magnitude of higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal activity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts and 4 orders of magnitude higher reactivity than conventional carbon nitride catalyst are exhibited by the optimized catalyst. Excellent operational stability (&gt;1700 h continuous operation) with &gt;120 L actual wastewater treatment capacity is demonstrated by practical implementation in a continuous&#8208;flow microreactor. This work advances electronic modulation strategies for sustainable water purification technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Identifies RBBP7 as a New E3 Ligase Supporting Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has been recognized as a powerful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small&#8208;molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein&#8208;targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR&#8208;ABL, BRD4, EGFRL858R, and EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S. Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the &#8220;pan&#8208;kinase&#8221; inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK&#8208;3&#946;, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide&#8208;containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Is the Smallest Molecular Trefoil Knot Actually the Tightest One?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a modular self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the successful synthesis of a new family of molecular trefoil knots with varied backbone&#8208;atom numbers. An interesting odd&#8208;even effect of alkyl chain linkers on their tightness was demonstrated, which not only provides key insights into size&#8208;tightness relationships but also guides further development of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials. 








Abstract
Tightness engineering has evolved as an efficient strategy for the design of knotted, woven, and entangled molecules and materials with desired properties and functions since tightness is a primary parameter that determines the property of a knotted strand. However, as an attractive topic that inspires mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists, whether the smallest knot is exactly the tightest one remains unaddressed experimentally. To tackle this challenge, a series of organic trefoil knots with the backbone&#8208;atom as short as 70 have been successfully synthesized by developing a new modular self&#8208;assembly approach in this study. To our great surprise, with the help of gradient tandem mass spectrometry, the quantitative tightness evaluation suggested that the molecular trefoil knot with a backbone crossing ratio (BCR) of 24.0 is even tighter than the one with a BCR of 23.3 (i.e., the smallest organic trefoil knot with the shortest ropelength synthesized so far), thus demonstrating an unexpected yet interesting odd&#8208;even effect to enhance the understanding of the tightness regulation of molecular knots.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Covalent Organic Frameworks via Isoreticular Design, Isomerism, and Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isoreticular COFs were synthesized by incrementally extending the organic linker from benzene to biphenyl to triphenyl, alongside their reversed&#8208;imine&#8208;orientation isomers, enabling a clear comparison of structural effects on activity. Notably, by optimizing protonation conditions, the biphenyl&#8208;linked COF&#8208;920 achieved an unprecedented hydrogen evolution rate of 364 mmol&#160;g&#8315;&#185;&#160;h&#8315;&#185; under UV&#8211;visible irradiation, as rigorously confirmed by water&#8208;drainage and gas&#8208;gathering experiments.








Abstract
Rational structural engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has significantly advanced their application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water splitting. However, the practical application of COFs for scalable solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion remains limited due to their insufficient photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we achieved an exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 364&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 using HCl&#8208;protonated COF&#8208;920 under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light, as confirmed by water&#8208;drainage and gas&#8208;gathering experiments, exceeding most previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Three series of isoreticular COFs were synthesized, incorporating benzene, biphenyl, and triphenyl linkers, along with their structural isomers featuring reversed imine bond orientations, to systematically investigate the collaborative influences of linker length, structural isomerism, and protonation on the photocatalytic performance. Experimental results revealed that COFs employing biphenyl&#8208;based linkers exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared to those with benzene or triphenyl linkers. Moreover, the performance difference resulting from variations in imine orientation decreases with increasing linker length, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing narrower energy differences between units connected by imine bonds (&#9472;C&#9552;N&#9472;). Our findings not only provide new insights into structure&#8211;activity relationships in COF photocatalysts but also highlight the potential of COF materials for sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

Moreover, the performance difference resulting from variations in imine orientation decreases with increasing linker length, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing narrower energy differences between units connected by imine bonds (&#9472;C&#9552;N&#9472;). Our findings not only provide new insights into structure&#8211;activity relationships in COF photocatalysts but also highlight the potential of COF materials for sustainable solar-to-fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8211;Polyoxometalate Crosslinked Metallo&#8211;Supramolecular Polymer as Artificial Interfacial Layer for Highly Persistent and Low&#8211;Temperature Tolerant Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer is designed and synthesized by utilizing a titanium&#8211;polyoxometalate (Ti&#8208;POM) to bridge organic and inorganic moieties, and it is utilized as an anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) to stabilize lithium metal anodes. The MSP&#8208;IPL possesses superior ion&#8208;transfer ability and outstanding electrochemical/ambient stability. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs can effectively bind with PF6&#8722;, enhancing Li+ transference number (tLi+&#160;= 0.607), promoting uniform distribution of Li+ flux.








Abstract
The uncontrolled lithium (Li) dendrite growth and fragile native solid electrolyte interphase formation have severely hindered the practical development of Li metal batteries. Herein, a coordinatively cross&#8208;linked metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymer as anodic interfacial protective layer (MSP&#8208;IPL) is developed by utilizing titanium(IV)&#8211;polyoxometalates (Ti&#8208;POMs) as hexatopic linkers to bridge organic and inorganic moieties. The constructed MSP&#8208;IPL possesses high electrochemical stability, superior ion&#8208;transfer ability, and good air stability. Due to its high film formation uniformity and mechanical tenacity, the MSP&#8208;IPL can effectively avoid nonuniform Li deposition caused by the tip effect, thus inhibiting Li dendrite proliferation. The uniformly distributed Ti&#8208;POMs in polymer skeleton can efficiently bind with PF6&#8722; anions, thus increasing Li+ transference number and promoting homogeneous Li+ distribution. The reprocessability and self&#8208;healing ability endowed by dynamic coordination bonds enable the MSP&#8208;IPL to accommodate electrode volume changes and maintain good interface contact. Consequently, high&#8208;loading Li||LiFePO4 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries based on MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li anodes demonstrate impressive cyclability and extraordinary rate capability. Even at a low temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the MSP&#8208;IPL&#8208;coated Li||NCM811 batteries can still cycle stably for over 500 cycles (equivalent to 138 days) with a considerable capacity retention of 86.8%. This work presents a promising solution for developing practical low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries.

         <title>Controlling Assembly of Hybrid DNA Nanostructures into Higher&#8208;Order Structures via Hydrophobicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We harness hydrophobic interactions, fundamental in biology yet underutilized in DNA nanotechnology, to build a design framework for hierarchical DNA assemblies. By conjugating small hydrophobic molecules to DNA motifs, we controlled the formation of higher&#8208;order structures, moving beyond traditional Watson&#8211;Crick pairing.








Abstract
Hydrophobic interactions are one of the fundamental driving forces of self&#8208;assembly in living systems. It remains challenging to harness hydrophobicity to have a controllable and programmable assembly of DNA nanostructures. On the other hand, there is also a need to explore orthogonal hierarchical assembly strategies to be used as an additional toolset along with the traditional Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing to achieve complex superstructures. In this work, we rationally design and synthesize a series of low molecular weight hydrophobic molecules that are conjugated to single&#8208;stranded DNA strands. By incorporating these modified DNA strands into the precisely defined locations of DNA tiles and origami nanostructures, we achieve controlled hierarchical assembly driven by hydrophobic interaction. We demonstrate a versatile hydrophobicity&#8208;guided higher&#8208;order assembly strategy by employing strategically engineered DNA nanostructures of increasing complexity, ranging from simple DNA tiles to complex origami structures, functionalized with these small hydrophobic molecules as programmable building blocks.

         <title>PyBOX&#8208;Integrated Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino acid chiral pool synthesis strategy has been developed for the construction of 1D chiral covalent organic frameworks incorporating a PyBOX skeleton. Subsequent metalation with an ice crystal&#8208;templated freeze&#8208;drying process led to sustainable heterogeneous catalysts for scalable asymmetric acetalization and A3&#8208;coupling reactions.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are the new sensation in asymmetric catalysis. The pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) (PyBOX), on the other hand, is a well&#8208;known class of privileged chiral ligands that can be incorporated with various metal ions for diversified homogeneous asymmetric organic transformations. The integration of the PyBOX into the COF platform will undoubtedly lead to a new breed of heterogeneous asymmetric catalysts. Herein, we report the first example of PyBOX&#8208;based CCOF via chiral pool synthesis for scale&#8208;up catalytic asymmetric acetalization and A3&#8208;coupling reaction. This research provides a novel type of sustainable COF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalyst with gratifying functionalities.

         <title>Gold and Bismuth Trimetallic Synergistic Redox Catalysis for Non&#8208;Directed C&#9472;H Arylation with Aryl Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear gold catalyzed selective C&#9472;H arylation by using aryl bismuth reagents as the arylation reagents has been developed. The Bi(V) generated in&#8208;situ can oxidize gold(I) to form Au&#9472;Au&#9472;Bi intermediate, where Bi's Z&#8208;type coordination mitigates steric/electronic constraints. This trimetallic strategy outperforms classical C&#9472;C couplings, tolerating silanes, boronate esters, and germanes, thus providing new insights for multimetallic cooperative catalysis.








Abstract
The influence of substituent effects plays an important role on the efficiency and regioselectivity toward C&#9472;H activation of non&#8208;directed arenes. Here, an unprecedented trimetallic synergistic redox catalysis system has been developed to achieve a highly efficient and orthogonal C&#9472;H arylation of non&#8208;directed arenes with aryl bismuth. Both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;deficient aryl bismuth can proceed C&#9472;H arylation readily, thus affording an elegant strategy for the synthesis of challenging electron&#8208;rich and sterically hindered biaryls by means of gold catalysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bi(V) species generated in&#8208;situ from Ar&#9472;Bi(III) and NFSI is not only an arylation reagent but also an oxidant to form a critical Au(II)&#9472;Au(II)&#9472;Bi intermediate (detected by HRMS). Interestingly, the binding Bi&#8208;moiety can modulate the electronic and steric environment of gold center through cooperative interactions, thus promoting the intramolecular transmetallation and reductive elimination. In addition, the synthetic robustness of this protocol has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale experiments and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Active Edge Sites Engineering on Amorphous Co&#8211;Mn Spinel&#8208;Based Oxides for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general synthesis approach is presented to prepare Turing&#8208;type porous CoMn2O4 nanoreactors, facilitating the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, thereby promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways.








Abstract
Rational modulation of edge active sites in the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers, is a hot topic in the heterogeneous catalysis field, yet the applicability of large&#8208;scale manufacturing remains a severe challenge. Herein, a general wet&#8208;chemical approach is reported to large&#8208;scale prepare porous CoMn2O4 with abundant active edge sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like activation without using a template or heat treatment. The obtained Turing&#8208;type structure not only can be assembled into spatially restricted domain CoMn2O4 nanoreactors but also greatly facilitates the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies in promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn2O4/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (1O2) pathways and maintained a degradation rate of 99.8% within 5 min after seven&#8208;cycle runs. Moreover, the application prospect of the PMS&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like process for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment, including sulfadiazine (SD) antibiotics in real river water and real pharmaceutical wastewater, was demonstrated by the fixed&#8208;bed tower reactor and the in&#8208;situ floating water treatment device.

&lt;p&gt;A facile and general synthesis approach is presented to prepare Turing-type porous CoMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoreactors, facilitating the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen-rich vacancies, thereby promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) pathways.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational modulation of edge active sites in the Fenton-like reaction, utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers, is a hot topic in the heterogeneous catalysis field, yet the applicability of large-scale manufacturing remains a severe challenge. Herein, a general wet-chemical approach is reported to large-scale prepare porous CoMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with abundant active edge sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like activation without using a template or heat treatment. The obtained Turing-type structure not only can be assembled into spatially restricted domain CoMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoreactors but also greatly facilitates the exposure of active edge sites with oxygen-rich vacancies in promoting PMS adsorption and interfacial charge transfer. The unique CoMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PMS system exhibited efficient and stable removal of organic pollutants with dominant nonradical (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) pathways and maintained a degradation rate of 99.8% within 5 min after seven-cycle runs. Moreover, the application prospect of the PMS-based Fenton-like process for large-scale wastewater treatment, including sulfadiazine (SD) antibiotics in real river water and real pharmaceutical wastewater, was demonstrated by the fixed-bed tower reactor and the in-situ floating water treatment device. This work will provide guidance for the development of low-cost and efficient heterogeneous PMS-activation catalysts through rational defect engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counterintuitive Photochemistry of an Isolated Acridinyl Radical: ConPET via Preassembly, Solvated Electrons or a Long&#8208;Lived Excited State?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we isolate the reduced form of a commonly used acridinium photocatalyst (acridinyl, Acr&#8226;) and investigate its photochemistry using transient absorption, analysed alongside TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We show that despite the apparent long lifetime of the fluorescent state of Acr&#8226;, it is not relevant to reactivity. Instead, reactivity occurs through counterintuitive preassembly and solvated electron&#8208;based mechanisms.








Abstract
Photoredox chemistry has seen a dramatic rise in popularity in recent years, but mechanistic understanding has persistently lagged behind reaction development itself. This is particularly true for the emerging area of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (conPET), which has attracted both great interest due to its ability to activate inert substrates selectively and under mild conditions and continuing controversy over its mechanistic feasibility. We describe herein the isolation of the key radical intermediate state of an acridinium&#8208;based conPET catalyst and detailed investigations of its photochemistry by a suite of (photo)reactivity, photoluminescence and transient absorption techniques, supported by computational studies. We observe strong wavelength and solvent dependencies in the reactivity profile, which correlate well with observations of a long&#8208;lived, fluorescent excited state that would be compatible with diffusion&#8208;limited reactivity. However, photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies suggest that, counter&#8208;intuitively, this state does not actually participate in reactivity. Instead, changes occur far faster than the diffusion limit, which provides strong, direct evidence for preassembly of the photocatalyst and substrate prior to photoexcitation. Further inspection also indicates parallel formation of solvated electrons, likely providing the major pathway under previously reported synthetic conditions, suggesting that otherwise competing rationales for conPET can in fact operate simultaneously.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), an important optical property of noble metal nanomaterials, is extensively applied in electrochemistry. However, the specific LSPR effects on metallic nanoparticles are difficult to unravel and evaluate owing to simultaneous factors like intrinsic electroactivity and surface interactions. Herein, we designed a series of shell&#8208;isolated nanostructures, with mesoporous silica shells and plasmonic Au Nanorod cores (AuNR@mSiO2), for precisely investigating both LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging was employed to monitor the in situ turnover frequency (TOF) of photon emissions on individual plasmonic nano&#8208;amplifiers to determine the dominant factors influencing LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. TOF heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images unveiled distinct hot spot distributions along the plasmonic nanostructures. Our approach provides insight into and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects during electrochemical reactions, thereby facilitating precise electrocatalyst design based on the physiochemical properties of LSPR.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Radical Photochromism and Photoluminescence via Polymer Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity of polymer matrices not only plays a crucial role in inducing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence by protecting the naphthalene diimide core structure from quenching by oxygen and moisture, but also facilitates the generation of stable anion radicals through photoinduced electron transfer, even in the absence of UV irradiation.








Abstract
While polymer matrices are widely used to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from oxygen and moisture quenching by providing a network that enables long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the influence of polymer polarity on phosphors for stable free radicals with radical luminescence (RL) has not been well studied. In this work, naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives, denoted as NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH (X&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;6), featuring different alkyl alcohol chains, exhibit multi&#8208;responsive and tunable RTP and RL properties through polymer matrix polarity regulation. Experimental results reveal that NDI&#8208;XC&#8208;OH&#8226;&#8722; anion radicals are generated via not only photoinduction in the excited state but also intermolecular interactions of polar matrix in the ground state. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that polar polymers rich in hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors (e.g., &#9472;NH2, &#9472;NH&#9472;, and &#9472;OH), where electrostatic interactions dominate over dispersion (E/D&#160;&gt;&#160;1), more readily induce anion radicals compared to polar polymers rich in acceptors (e.g., &#9472;CN and &#9472;CO&#9472;), where dispersion interactions outweigh electrostatic effects (E/D&#160;&lt;&#160;1). These derivatives exhibit potential applications in information encryption and volatile amine detection due to their chromic and luminescent properties. These findings offer perspectives on the role of polymer matrix polarity in modulating anion radical behavior, and mechanistic insights into the balance between RTP and RL properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charge and ion transport dynamics, storage capacity, and cycling performance of Faradaic Cl&#8208; ion storage electrodes have recently constrained advancements in supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI). Herein, a high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF (TAPA&#8208;COF)&#8208;based Cl&#8208; ion storage material (TAPArGO) with exceptional cycling stability was synthesized via an in situ condensation reaction utilizing graphene as a conductive substrate. The interfacial coupling involving graphene and TAPA&#8208;COF increases the interfacial electron density, boosting local charge accumulation and Cl&#8208; ion storage capacity. Additionally, the dual conductive strategy of incorporating graphene and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization of TAPA&#8208;COF enhances the redox kinetics, while the triphenylamine N redox centers and flexible graphene network improve cycling stability. Consequently, the Cl&#8208; ion asymmetric SC employing the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode achieves a specific energy output of 52.4 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 950 W kg&#8208;1, with exciting cycling durability retaining 96.8% of the initial capacity after 100,000 cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid CDI system based on the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode demonstrates a specific adsorption capacity of 55.0 mg g&#8208;1, along with remarkable cycling desalination/regeneration ability (99.8% after 200 desalination/regeneration cycles).

         <title>Revealing the correlation of loading&#8208;to&#8208;performance of single atom catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between mental loading and overall catalytic performance remains elusive for single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs), which hinders the oriented optimization of active site densities and scalable synthesis of them. To effectively address this issue, Ru single atoms with different loading are anchored on the graphene&#8208;like framework&#160;and tungsten carbide substrate (WC1&#8208;x) to investigate the synergistic effect among different local configurations. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the loading of Ru atoms critically governs the interatomic distance between adjacent metal active sites at second shell coordination. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy shows that WC1&#8208;x nanoparticles can break the hydrogen bond network by reorienting H2O molecule adsorption and promoting the availability of active H2O among electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the moderate distance between active sites could further lower the reaction barrier and enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, the optimal sample Ru&#8208;WC1&#8208;x with 0.76 wt% Ru loading exhibits a low overpotential of 7 mV at 10 mA&#215;cm&#8722;2 and the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer to stably operate for 100 h at 1 A&#215;cm&#8722;2. Such correlation of spatial effects between different active sites were universally demonstrated in similar systems anchored with either Pt, Ir or Co elements.</dc:description>

In-situ Raman spectroscopy shows that WC1-x nanoparticles can break the hydrogen bond network by reorienting H2O molecule adsorption and promoting the availability of active H2O among electrode-electrolyte interface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the moderate distance between active sites could further lower the reaction barrier and enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, the optimal sample Ru-WC1-x with 0.76 wt% Ru loading exhibits a low overpotential of 7 mV at 10 mA&#215;cm&#8722;2 and the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer to stably operate for 100 h at 1 A&#215;cm&#8722;2. Such correlation of spatial effects between different active sites were universally demonstrated in similar systems anchored with either Pt, Ir or Co elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nuclear quantum confinement enables robust deuterium bonds for highly reversible aluminum anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fundamentally limits aluminum electroreduction in aqueous electrolytes by dominating interfacial charge transfer. Here, we suppress HER by engineering deuterium bonds (D&#8208;bonds) through nuclear quantum effects, confining D between D&#8322;O and DMF molecules. This quantum confinement weakens hydrogen delocalization and restructures the Al3+ solvation sheath, reducing water activity kinetically and thermodynamically. The regulated electrolyte enables uniform aluminum nucleation and dense plating layers, achieving 569 h (0.05 mA cm&#8208;2) and 379 h (0.1 mA cm&#8208;2) cycling stability in the 2D2O/1DMF electrolyte, which outperforms traditional sulfate electrolytes by 3.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. Our work uniquely leverages nuclear quantum confinement to engineer robust D&#8208;bonds, simultaneously suppressing HER and enabling atomic&#8208;level control over aluminum solvation structures for unprecedented Al redox reversibility in sulfate electrolytes. This exemplification pushes the electrolyte engineering from extensive component adjustment to quantum precision engineering, which provides an innovative solution for the high&#8208;activity water&#8208;based battery system.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Ligand Exchange Dynamics of Hexacyanochromate&#8208;Based Redox Mediators in Aqueous Iron&#8208;Chromium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous redox flow batteries (AQRFBs) are revolutionizing energy storage by integrating sustainability with cutting&#8208;edge innovation. Among them, Iron&#8208;Chromium RFBs (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low&#8208;cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K3[Cr(CN)6]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long&#8208;term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91 Wh L&#8208;1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76&#8208;77%. This research provides valuable insights into the degradation pathways of hexacyanochromate&#8208;based negolytes and emphasizes the importance of optimized electrolyte design for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Layered Heterostructure Enables Reversible Oxygen Redox in Lithium Manganese Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), primarily due to their exceptional capacity originating from oxygen redox chemistry. While Li2MnO3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox&#8208;active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural&#8208;engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel&#8208;layered heterostructures (designated as LMO&#8208;SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O2&#8208;) and molecular oxygen (O2) &#8208; the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese&#8208;based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li+ diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO&#8208;based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high&#8208;capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Reactivity of Thioimidates for Diversified Polymeric Amidines with Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first reactions of thioimidates under radical&#8208;mediated conditions are described along with the delineation of structural factors that impact radical reactivity and possible side reactions. Thioimidate&#8208;containing copolymers with methylmethacrylate (MMA) are synthesized through radical mediated, chain&#8208;growth polymerization. These materials serve as a synthetic branch point for facile conversion into amidines by treatment with a weak&#8208;acid and an external amine. Our approach allows for more diverse amidine structure than have been previously reported in polymers. This chemistry also enables crosslinking to form novel hydrogels with finely tuned acid&#8208;base behavior. Subsequent examination of the acid&#8208;base properties revealed that these features are preserved across linear, soluble amidine polymers to crosslinked amidine gel polymer architectures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the investigation of inorganic reagents containing the pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) moiety is presented. First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#8208;N=S(O)F2) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Coupling&#8208;Engineered Coordination&#8208;Unsaturated CuAg Nanochains Drives Spontaneous Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation and Zn&#8208;C2H2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) offers a mild and sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet it faces critical challenges including competitive C&#8208;C coupling for 1,3&#8208;butadiene due to insufficient proton supply and hydrogen evolution under high current densities. To address these limitations, we design a coordination&#8208;unsaturated CuAg bimetallic catalyst with cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs), which synergistically regulates proton dynamics, maintaining high activity from 0.1 to 0.6 A cm&#8208;2 and achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8208;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the introduction of Cu makes the d&#8208;band center in Cu0.5Ag CNCs upshift toward the Fermi level, strengthening orbital coupling with C2H2 and creating a high *H demand surface. In&#8208;situ spectroscopic and density functional theory analyses demonstrate that coordination&#8208;unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag interfacial sites promote spontaneous C2H2 hydrogenation,especially by passing formation barriers of *C2H2 and *C2H3. This thermodynamic superiority originates from sufficient proton supply and exothermic *H consumption for C2H2 hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst enables a Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery with a power density of 2.12 mW cm&#8208;2, showcasing dual functionality in electrosynthesis and energy storage. Our work establishes a paradigm for coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalyst design through orbital coupling engineering, providing atomic&#8208;level insights into proton&#8208;mediated reaction control for sustainable chemical manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Regulation of Perovskite Growth and Energetics via Oligoether Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembling Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling molecules (SAMs) are widely used as interfacial layers to optimize the surface properties of nickel oxides (NiOx) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, less attention is paid to the effect of SAMs on the regulation of perovskite growth and energetics. Here, based on the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular backbone, oligoether chain is introduced with different chain length to endow two novel SAMs namely EPA and MEPA with good capability of bottom&#8208;up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiOx with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain&#8208;containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization and importantly well&#8208;matched energy level alignment at the top surface especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiOx/MEPA based PSCs along with good device stability which can maintain 90% of initial efficiency under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions over 1260 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Excited State Proton Transfer in Thin Films Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular structure, solvent/matrix, the surrounding environment, and molecular vibrations can influence the excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Theoretical studies predict that light&#8208;matter strong coupling can also modify the energy barrier for proton transfer reactions. Here, we experimentally explore the role of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on the ESPT using the weak photoacid, 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthalenesulfonate (N8S) as the probe. The ESPT in N8S can occur through a solvent/matrix bridge connecting the proton&#8208;donating and accepting units. To check the role of VSC, we embedded N8S in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix and strongly coupled the &#8208;OH stretching vibrational modes of PVA. The steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission analysis reveal that the quantum yield of RO&#8208; emission and the ESPT rate constant improve by a factor of two under VSC, compared to the non&#8208;cavity, half&#8208;cavity, and off&#8208;resonance films. Our findings indicate that VSC can be a tool to control the proton transfer processes, opening avenues for developing physically tunable photoacid&#8208;based sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;mediated DNAzyme Chaperoning for Sensitive Trace Metal Ion Mapping on Live Neuronal Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transient release of metal ions at neuronal cell membranes holds significant implications in neurophysiology and pathology, necessitating highly sensitive methods for spatially resolved quantification in live cells. DNAzymes have emerged as powerful tools for metal ion detection due to their inherent specificity, yet their practical application is often hindered by limited stability and sensitivity. Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes, aiming at enhancing the stability and activity of DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes is shown to significantly enhance metal ion detection performance, resulting in elevated stability and a 2&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity, attributed to alterations in the local net charge induced by TDF. In vitro investigations demonstrate that the nanodevice developed here faithfully maps Cu2+ concentrations within a range of 0 &#8208; 10 &#181;M on the membrane of neuronal cells, meeting the requirements for Cu2+ sensing under both physiological and pathological conditions. This work presents an easily adaptable approach to enhance the performance of DNAzymes and lays the foundations for the development of other DNAzyme&#8208;based sensitive detection nanodevices.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM led to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and Nitrate via Porphyrin and Metalloporphyrin MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional urea synthesis via the Bosch&#8208;Meiser process suffers from high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Electrocatalytic urea production from CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8208;) under ambient conditions offers a sustainable alternative, yet challenges persist due to variable NO3&#8208; concentrations and competing side reactions. Herein, we propose porphyrin metal&#8208;organic framework (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) catalysts for NO3&#8208; concentration&#8208;adaptive urea synthesis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PMOF weakly adsorbs *NO2 via hydrogen bonding, favoring its coupling with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF strongly binds *NO2 at Cu sites, facilitating spontaneous *NO/*CO coupling to form *OCNO intermediates under dilute NO3&#8208; conditions. Experimentally, PMOF achieves a urea yield of 28.6 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 and &#160;a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 23.1% in 0.1 M NO3&#8208;, whereas Cu&#8208;PMOF outperforms in 0.05 M NO3&#8208; with a yield of 25.5 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 and FE of 52.7%. In situ spectroscopy and mechanistic study confirm distinct pathways: PMOF relies on stepwise coupling of *HNO2 with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF enables consecutive *NO&#8208;*CO coupling. This work highlights adaptive electrocatalyst design for efficient C&#8208;N coupling, advancing sustainable urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Aggregation&#8208;Driven d&#8208;Band Engineering in Nickel Cocatalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient CO2 activation remains a pivotal challenge in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, necessitating precise electronic modulation of catalytic centers to overcome kinetic limitations. In this work, we engineer Ni(bpy)3Br2 cocatalyst aggregates via non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly and systematically unravel the role of aggregation in governing photocatalytic performance. A synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrates that symmetry disruption within the aggregates induces localized charge redistribution. Such a charge redistribution triggers a 0.6 eV upshift in the Ni d&#8208;band center, which delivers lower Gibbs free energies for the formation of *CO2 and *COOH. The optimized aggregates achieve a record&#8208;high quantum yield of 26.84% at 450 nm with 99.3% CO selectivity, representing the highest performance reported to date for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion systems. Importantly, the d&#8208;band center of the Ni sites can be precisely modulated by varying the aggregation degree of Ni(bpy)3Br2. This work not only advances a novel d&#8208;band center modulation strategy for electronic configuration engineering but also provides in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level insights into the aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;regulated d&#8208;band center.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulate the Singlet&#8211;triplet Energy Gap by Spatially Separating HOMO and LUMO for High Performance Organic Photovoltaic Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing the single&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules has been proposed to be able to reduce the nonradiative recombination by tuning low&#8208;lying triplet state (T1) and/or the excited state (S1), thus reducing the energy loss (Eloss) and increasing the open&#8208;circuit voltage in their devices. However, how to design the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with small &#8710;EST and high performance is challenging. Aiming to address this issue, YDF, YTF and YTF&#8208;H were synthesized. Among them, device based on YDF with partially spatially separating HOMO and LUMO exhibits a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.04%, which is one of the most efficient efficiencies for binary systems. For YTF and YTF&#8208;H, their completely spatially separated HOMO and LUMO indeed leads a much reducing of &#8710;EST caused by low&#8208;lying S1 state, together with excellent charge mobility and light absorption, required for higher performance OPV. But their low S1 state cause several non&#8208;radiative recombination due to strong S1&#8208;S0 coupling (PCE &lt;1.5%). These results indicate that future design to have high performance molecules with small &#8710;EST should avoid the sharp decrease in S1, and the ideal scenario would be to elevate the T1 state, thereby mitigating the energy gap law.</dc:description>

         <title>EDTA&#8208;Mg Nano&#8208;Chelators Amplify Ferroptosis by Artificially Simulating the Epithelial&#8208;Mesenchymal Transition Process and Endogenous Iron Deprivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in initiating tumor metastasis. Commonly, researchers focus on inhibiting EMT to prevent tumor metastasis. However, they ignore that tumor cells undergoing EMT are more vulnerable to disturbance from the external environment. Tumor cells in this period are a potential therapeutic target, yet precisely regulating the EMT of tumor cells remains a challenging problem to be solved. Here, based on metal chelation therapy, we propose a strategy of artificially mimicking EMT, integrating ferroptosis and immunotherapy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. The prepared ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid&#8208;magnesium (EDTA&#8208;Mg), on the one hand, chelates Ca2+ on the surface of tumor cells to form EDTA&#8208;Ca, causing the dissociation of tumor cells. Meanwhile, E&#8208;cadherin is downregulated, while vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP&#8208;2) are upregulated, indicating the occurrence of EMT. On the other hand, after EDTA&#8208;Ca is endocytosed by tumor cells, it deprives Fe in the lysosomes to form EDTA&#8208;Fe, which induces ferroptosis through a Fenton reaction. Ferroptosis, combined with the initially released Mg2+, synergistically amplifies the immune response, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, such a strategy of artificially simulating EMT for tumor treatment has hitherto not been reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dominated Calendar Aging in Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;dominated plating morphology governs the calendar aging of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Notably, corrosion severity does not directly correlate with aging&#8208;induced degradation. Electrolytes that promote smoother zinc deposition, quantified by a lower plating roughness factor (Prf), exhibit enhanced resistance to calendar aging. Leveraging this insight, an acetatization strategy achieves up to a 49&#8208;fold reduction in calendar aging&#8211;induced degradation.








Abstract
Zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage. While the majority of current research focuses on cyclic aging, the impact of calendar aging on zinc anodes has received far less attention. Here, we reveal that zinc deposition morphology, governed by anion chemistry, plays a decisive role in calendar degradation by amplifying interfacial corrosion and accelerating &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc accumulation. Notably, intrinsic corrosion rates alone do not predict degradation severity; for instance, triflate anion shows low corrosion but induces highly porous deposits and rapid aging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive electrochemical descriptor to quantify deposition morphology beyond traditional morphological characterization. Moreover, we introduce an acetatization strategy that tailors Zn2+ solvation and promotes dense plating, effectively suppressing side reactions and &#8220;dead&#8221; zinc formation. This approach effectively curbs calendar degradation, yielding nearly a 49&#8208;fold improvement in capacity retention. Under demanding conditions (6&#160;h aging intervals per cycle), practical anode&#8208;free Cu||ZnI2 cells (ca. 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) exhibit high cycling stability, maintaining 96.2% of their initial capacity over 1000&#160;h. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of zinc anode degradation and offer a viable route to address calendar aging in ZMBs.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Boosting Current Density of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction using Metal&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid metal&#8211;enzyme electrode integrating bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) with a metallic catalyst facilitates enhanced CO2 electroreduction. The bCA dynamically catalyzes the reversible conversion between CO2 and bicarbonate, enabling local CO2 regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enzyme&#8208;mediated CO2 supply significantly boosts CO2RR current density beyond mass transfer limits, even under flooding conditions, as reported by Jinwoo Lee, Jungbae Kim, Ki Tae Park et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202504380).

         <title>MXene&#8208;Supported Ru&#8211;Ni: A Common Active Site for Hydrolysis, Hydrogen Oxidation, and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 catalyst was utilized to investigate the activation and conversion of hydrogen. RuNi&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits outstanding activity in AB hydrolysis, HOR, and phenylethylene tandem reaction, especially TOF of AB hydrolysis up to 1833 min&#8722;1.








Abstract
Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single&#8208;mode catalyst are crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H2 molecules in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)&#8208;MXene catalysts. RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti3C2 MXene. The optimal Ru2.5Ni2.5&#8208;Ti3C2 exhibits the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&#8722;1 toward ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity originates from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters&#8208;Ti3C2 and the promotion of H2 molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster&#8208;MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8212;Ti3C2 with multisites provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H2 molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nanocluster&#8208;MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction&#8208;inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multifunctional catalysts in energy, chemistry, and materials applications.

RuNi-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding activity in AB hydrolysis, HOR, and phenylethylene tandem reaction, especially TOF of AB hydrolysis up to 1833 min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights into the activation and conversion of hydrogen using a single-mode catalyst are crucial for advancing fuels and fine chemical production. In this paper, the activation and conversion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in hydrogen production and application were investigated on RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe)-MXene catalysts. RuM (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Co, Cu, Fe) bimetallic nanoclusters were uniformly distributed on Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MXene. The optimal Ru&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1833 min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; toward ammonia borane (AB, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the catalysts also showed good catalytic activity in hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The high activity originates from the acceleration of the catalytic process by RuNi clusters-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the promotion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecular transport by the special interface of RuNi cluster-MXene. The RuNi clusters&#8212;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with multisites provide a dependable platform for the regulated activation and conversion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and various reaction intermediates. The competitiveness of nanocluster-MXene catalytic material is showcased for activation and conversion of hydrogen. This research of reaction-inducing adaptation uncovered the pathway to explore multifunctional catalysts in energy, chemistry, and materials applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal Atom&#8211;Cluster Synergistic Modification with Tuned d&#8208;band Center Imparts Longevous Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal atom&#8211;cluster synergistic strategy modifies the aluminum current collector to enhance potassiophilicity, increase nucleation density and induce 3D progressive nucleation mode, thereby ensuring a dendrite&#8208;free potassium anode toward robust potassium metal batteries.








Abstract
The tailored nucleation and growth of potassium metal over a current collector is essential to realize longevous potassium metal anodes. The commercial current collector lacks sufficient nucleation sites and fails to guide uniform deposition, underscoring the request for interfacial modulation maneuvers. Herein, we develop transition metal atom&#8211;cluster moiety decorated N&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanosphere to modify the Al current collector. In a Fe model system, the Fe single atoms provide high surface energy and fast charge transfer, while Fe clusters serve as local electron reservoirs. This cooperative architecture manages to tune the d&#8208;band center, accordingly promoting the potassium capture and minimizing the nucleation overpotential to merely 4&#160;mV. Theoretical simulations and in situ microscopic/spectroscopic characterizations evidence that the synergistic modification markedly accelerates potassium plating/stripping kinetics, enabling prolonged symmetric&#8208;cell cycling (approaching 3000&#160;h) and stabilized full&#8208;cell performance (0.022% decay rate per cycle over 2000 cycles). This strategy could be extended to other transition metals (e.g., Co, Ni, or Cu), offering a paradigm for atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering toward reversible alkali metal batteries.

         <title>Introducing Steric Bulk Into Silylboranes: Enhanced Bench Stability and Novel Chemical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following initial experimental and theoretical studies that indicated that silylboranes decompose via oxygenation, bulky silyl anions were used to synthesize silylboranes with enhanced bench stability and novel reactivity. These kinetically stabilized silylboranes are stable in air and moderately activate carbon monoxide (CO) to form spirocyclic compounds. DFT calculations suggested that the activation of CO is driven by hyperconjugation.








Abstract
Silylboranes are versatile intermediates in organic synthesis, and a wide range of structural variants of silylboranes have already been synthesized. However, the stability of silylboranes varies significantly, and their decomposition mechanism remains to be fully understood. Moreover, some silylborane motifs have not yet been applied as synthetic reagents due to their instability. To address this issue, we first investigated the decomposition mechanism of silylboranes in air and moisture using experimental and theoretical methods. We discovered that oxygenation by atmospheric oxygen is the major decomposition pathway, resulting in the formation of a borylsilylether, and that the introduction of a bulky silyl group suppresses this decomposition. Based on these results, we synthesized triisopropylsilyldimesitylborane (i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2), which exhibits high bench stability. Moreover, i&#8208;Pr3Si&#8211;BMes2 reacts with carbon monoxide (CO), which is the first example of a reaction between a silylborane and CO. Further computational studies revealed that electronic effects, including hyperconjugation between the Si&#9472;B &#963;&#8208;bond and C&#9472;O &#960;*&#8208;bond, are crucial for CO activation. Furthermore, we prepared a bench&#8208;stable bissilylaminoborane by introducing triisopropylsilyl groups, providing a bissilylchloroborane upon hydrogen chloride treatment. These findings provide valuable insights into how steric and electronic effects can be used to optimize the balance between stability and reactivity in silylboranes.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Synthesis of Molecular Organo&#8208;f&#8208;Element&#8208;Polyphosphides With Non&#8208;Classical Divalent Lanthanide Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows the largest polyphosphides of the f&#8208;elements, which is a P144&#8208; polyphosphide Zintl anion coordinated to two lanthanide and two potassium ions. These compounds were obtained by reduction of white phosphorus with precursors of the early non&#8208;classical divalent lanthanides, as reported by Peter W. Roesky et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202503403). The central P144&#8208; tetradecaphosphide Zintl ion, can be interpreted as a P&#8208;P bridged dimer of two nortricyclane P72&#8208; units. The artwork was designed by Alicia K. Finch.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover illustrates the catalytic mechanism of a cobalt&#8208;triptycene framework with ABC stacking for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and H2. Uniformly distributed Co sites along the pore walls and the ABC stacking facilitate molecular diffusion, thereby accelerating the photocatalytic reaction. The framework regulates the transport of CO2, H2O, and *COOH intermediates, while hydrogen bonding between H2O and CO2 coupled with carbonate formation enriches CO2 concentration at metal active sites, promoting the reduction process, as reported by Wei Zhou, Xiao Wang, Xing Lu et&#160;al. in theor Research Article (e202504155).

         <title>Selective electrochemical production of ethylene from bicarbonate solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report an engineered material structuring to selectively produce C2+ products with high FE directly from a N2&#8208;saturated bicarbonate solution. Multiphysics modeling studies reveal the critical role of local current density distribution and the spatio&#8208;selective evolution of C2+ products, which is favored in thinner catalysts (240 &#181;m thickness). By jointly tailoring catalyst configuration and mass transport in bicarbonate electroreduction&#8212;adjusting the thickness (ranges from 1040 &#181;m to 240 &#181;m), porosity, and surface oxidation of Cu mesh catalysts, as well as catholyte composition&#8212;we achieved a maximum ethylene FE of 39% and total C2+ product FE over 55% at 150 mA/cm2 with a 240 &#181;m thickness of Cu mesh. The system is also stable for over 160 hours at 100 mA/cm2 with maintained ethylene FE over 20%. The direct (bi)carbonate electrolysis system converts bicarbonate into C2+ products with a CO2 utilization efficiency of more than 90%, thereby reducing potential expenses associated with regeneration and separation. We determine that optimizing the catalyst pore structure, which governs the diffusion of the bicarbonate solution, and the copper surface oxide layer, which determines product FE, is critical to maximizing ethylene production from bicarbonate solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Inositol Pyrophosphate Toolbox: Stereoselective Synthesis and Application of PP&#8208;InsP4 Isomers in Plant Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional Second Harmonic Generation in Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxyfluoroniobate Crystals via Structural Fingerprint Optimization of Polar Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chain&#8208;based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors&#9472;namely, the &#8736;(O&#8722;Nb&#8722;O&#8217;) bond angle, &#967;[F, Nb, Nb&#8217;, F&#8217;] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO2F4] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating &#960;&#8208;conjugated biuret (C2H5N3O2) molecules with optimally aligned 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chains, we synthesized (H3O)(Biu)2(NbOF4) (Biu = biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH2PO4, among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (&#916;n = 0.062 @1064 nm) and wide band gap (Eg = 4.50 eV) further support its potential as a high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next&#8208;generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal&#8208;Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C=C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C=C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C=C double bonds, leading to a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects. By achieving precise capture and folding of flexible olefinic substrates, this study establishes a new paradigm for the design of artificial host molecules and a novel platform for enzyme&#8208;like reaction vessels.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Mediated Interfacial Proton&#8208;Directed Transfer Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia over Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a sustainable strategy that simultaneously realizes the nitrogen cycle and resource integration. The key issue hindering the NORR efficiency is accelerating proton (*H) transfer to facilitate NO hydrogenation while inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate an interface&#8208;engineered sulfur&#8208;mediated Cu@Co electrocatalyst (S&#8208;Cu@Co/C) that boosts NORR performance through dual modulation of electronic structure and proton transfer on active sites. A comprehensive program of experimental and theoretical calculations was employed to discover that sulfur incorporation induces electron redistribution in the Cu&#8208;Co interface, creating electron&#8208;rich sulfur and electron&#8208;deficient metals. This electronic configuration synergistically enhances NO adsorption on Cu sites and promotes water dissociation on Co sites. More critically, sulfur could direct the rapid transfer of *H from Co to Cu sites, thereby accelerating the NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER. Consequently, S&#8208;Cu@Co/C achieves an NH3 yield rate of 655.3 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.4% in an H&#8208;cell. Remarkably, the catalyst could maintain continuous electrolysis tests and steady NH3 yield up to 100 h. This work provides innovative insights into the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts via heteroatom&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering strategies.</dc:description>

This electronic configuration synergistically enhances NO adsorption on Cu sites and promotes water dissociation on Co sites. More critically, sulfur could direct the rapid transfer of *H from Co to Cu sites, thereby accelerating the NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER. Consequently, S-Cu@Co/C achieves an NH3 yield rate of 655.3 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.4% in an H-cell. Remarkably, the catalyst could maintain continuous electrolysis tests and steady NH3 yield up to 100 h. This work provides innovative insights into the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts via heteroatom-mediated interfacial engineering strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS&#8217;s ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe TL&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated the XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1,874 FDA&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with Cys342 of XPB, suppressed XPB&#8217;s ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive N2 Cleavage and Nitride Insertion Reactivity at Molybdenum Complexes Supported by a Rigid PNP Pincer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitride species represent key reactive intermediates in reductive N2 cleavage and functionalization. Toward a better understanding of nitride transfer reactivity, we present a series of Mo&#8208;nitride complexes supported by a rigid diphosphino&#8208;acridane pincer ligand. Notably, the stepwise reduction of a MoIVCl3 complex under N2 allows the isolation of a bridging diazenido intermediate as well as a dinuclear Mo&#8208;nitride species (4) accommodating a bridging N2 moiety. This is the first example of a Mo(IV) nitride&#8208;N2 species and extensive 15N&#8208;labelling studies were performed to characterize the bridging dinitrogen, diazenido, and nitride moieties. The structure of 4 adopts two orthogonal &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions between N2 and two structurally rigidified MoIV(N) fragments featuring a filled d&#960; orbital. Effective &#960;&#8208;backbonding from such a MoIV(N) fragment leads to the isolation of PMe3, CO, and CNtBu substituted analogues. Further reactivity of the Mo&#8208;nitride species with &#960;&#8208;acidic CO and isocyanide leads to the formation of MoII&#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;carbodiimide species, respectively. Computational studies suggest that nitride carbonylation proceeds via an associative nitride insertion pathway, encouraging further studies in direct N2 fixation to value&#8208;added products via nitride functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Defect Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tandem CO2 Electroreduction and Carbonylation Reactions from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem CO2 reduction with carbonylation reactions represents a promising approach to convert greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Herein, we propose a universal &#8216;N/O mixed pre&#8208;coordination pyrolysis&#8217; strategy to construct vacancy&#8208;defect single atom catalysts (Ni1&#8208;, Mn1&#8208;, Fe1&#8208;, Co1&#8208;, and Cu1&#8208;NC) with M&#8208;N3 coordination microenvironment. This vacancy&#8208;defect endows Ni1&#8208;NC with excellent performance for CO2 electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300 mA cm&#8722;2. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13 g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO2 system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly method for CO2 separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote and Spatiotemporal Modulation of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Croconaine Dyes via NIR Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymerization holds great promise for the fabrication of well&#8208;defined nanostructures. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control over the dynamic assembly of supramolecular polymers using external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation strategy that exploits the intrinsic photothermal properties of croconaine&#8208;based molecular building blocks to modulate the aggregation&#8211;dissociation equilibrium of seeds, thereby enabling the formation of supramolecular polymers and copolymers. Light irradiation provides enhanced tunability through adjustments in laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength. Notably, the spatial precision afforded by laser irradiation allows for localized seed dissociation, offering a new approach for spatially controlled supramolecular polymerization. This method also enables efficient light&#8208;mediated gel formation, spatially selective sol&#8211;gel transitions, and healing in supramolecular organogels. These findings demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive strategy for regulating supramolecular polymerization and open new avenues for constructing nanomaterials with programmable structures and functions.</dc:description>

Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine&#8208;containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional&#8208;group tolerance and scalability; they therefore hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction begins with nickel&#8208;catalyzed generation of a methyl radical, followed by radical cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Sn Alloy Hollow Microbox for High&#8208;Performance CO2&#160;Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic catalyst&#8217;s restructuring creates a new catalytic surface&#160;that&#160;is essential for boosting the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR).&#160;In this&#160;work, we synthesize Ag&#8208;decorated SnS2&#160;hollow microboxes using a co&#8208;precipitation method followed by&#160;a&#160;hydrothermal treatment.&#160;Based on&#160;a collection of&#160;in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situcharacterizations including&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;Raman spectroscopy,&#160;rapid&#160;freeze&#8208;quench&#160;(RFQ)&#160;119Sn&#160;M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag&#8208;decorated&#160;SnS2&#160;(Ag@SnS2) hollow microboxes&#160;undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO2RR, leading to the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formation of&#160;S&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Sn alloy (S&#8208;Ag3Sn/Sn)&#160;hollow microboxes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dynamic catalyst&#8217;s restructuring creates a new catalytic surface&#160;that&#160;is essential for boosting the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR).&#160;In this&#160;work, we synthesize Ag-decorated SnS2&#160;hollow microboxes using a co-precipitation method followed by&#160;a&#160;hydrothermal treatment.&#160;Based on&#160;a collection of&#160;in-situ/ex-situcharacterizations including&#160;in-situ&#160;Raman spectroscopy,&#160;rapid&#160;freeze-quench&#160;(RFQ)&#160;119Sn&#160;M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we discover that the Ag-decorated&#160;SnS2&#160;(Ag@SnS2) hollow microboxes&#160;undergo dynamic reduction and reconstruction during the electrochemical CO2RR, leading to the&#160;in-situ&#160;formation of&#160;S-doped Ag-Sn alloy (S-Ag3Sn/Sn)&#160;hollow microboxes. This transformation results in a remarkable formate selectivity of 92.4% with a formate partial current density of 97.3 mA&#8231;cm-2&#160;at -0.8 V&#160;vs. RHE in an H-cell.&#160;in-situattenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both S-doping and Ag-Sn alloying enhance the CO2&#160;adsorption and improve the stability of *OCHO intermediate.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Amorphous Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Films for Direct X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X&#8208;ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X&#8208;ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time&#8208;intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large&#8208;area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X&#8208;ray detection. By reacting a non&#8208;crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz+) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42&#8208; anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42&#8208; anions serve as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz+ cations as charge transporters. Direct X&#8208;ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 2,165 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20 V.mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01 nGyair s&#8722;1. The amorphous nature of these films enhances their processability, allowing for fabrication in various sizes and shapes, and making them highly adaptable for scalable detector applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enabled Stable Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes via &#960;&#8208;Type Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively stabilizing oxygen redox is the most challenging task for practical applications of high energy density Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. However, how to accurately tune the oxygen energy level to achieve reversible redox remains puzzling so far. In this work, we achieve stable oxygen redox in layered Li&#8208;rich materials over the whole voltage range without irreversible O2 release by adjusting the interlayer metal cation environment adjacent to the ligand. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis of metal&#8208;ligand orbital combinations, we confirm the obvious charge transfer from O to Ni due to the &#960;&#8208;type interaction between Ni 3d spin&#8208;down t2g orbitals and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Ni coordination environment after Li extraction under the &#960;&#8208;type interaction, which enhances the intrinsic competition between anion and cation oxidation, keeping O 2p state below the metal band to avoid over&#8208;oxidation. As a result, the modified material shows improved electrochemical performance and stable structural/interface evolution. This work provides new insights into the relationship between the adjacent metal environment and the ligand O redox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Active Hydrogen Absorption and Stabilized Cu(I) Species over Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce Bridges Boosting Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of water activation center to promote active hydrogen (*H) generation and stabilize Cu(I) species are significant for the formation of multicarbon (C2+) products over Cu&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8208;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic&#160;efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8208;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8208;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus configurations, characterized by their inherent asymmetry, enable directional mass transfer in membrane materials that drives novel and energy&#8208;efficient chemical processes. This Janus superiority spans applications from nanoscale molecular and ionic transport to macro&#8208;scale separation systems with asymmetric spatial architectures. This review provides an analysis of the material foundations including design principles, structure regulation, and scalability challenges underlying Janus membranes. We explore the physics that govern their unique behavior and examine their diverse applications across chemical engineering, including phase transfer, and molecular or ionic transport. Through a multiscale perspective, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Janus superiority in advancing chemical engineering technologies. Finally, we discuss the hurdles in translating theoretical advances into practical applications and propose promising avenues for future research to harness the full potential of Janus membranes and systems in addressing global challenges related to energy, sustainability, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Multiple Hydrogen Bonds of Nucleobases Enable Precise Tunability of DNA&#8208;Polymer Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures manifest enhanced stability and chemical diversity for various applications such as sensing, imaging, immune modulation. However, the functionality of the hydrophobic polymer in the core is often disregarded, leading to limited property tunability of DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures. Herein, we have successfully fabricated tunable DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures by harnessing orthogonal multiple hydrogen bonds (MHBs) within both the core and shell domains. Distinct DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures, consisting of hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNAs have been rationally designed and successfully constructed. The DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures undergo the controlled morphological transformation triggered by hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and surface functionalization by hydrophilic DNA chains. Owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity, the robust MHB interactions for complementary DNAs and nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers are highly selective and orthogonal. Most significantly, the reported core&#8208;driven morphological transformation and surface functionalization of shell layer are general to expand the structural and properties tunability of DNA nanostructures with different DNA sequences. This work provides an efficient and novel route to precisely modulating DNA&#8208;polymer core&#8208;shell nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic core through orthogonal MHBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Activatable PROTAC Prodrug for Tumor Biomarker&#8208;Driven Near&#8208;Infrared Opto&#8208;Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor&#8208;homing cyclopeptide through a tandem&#8208;locking linker, which comprises a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor&#8208;selective degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem&#8208;activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off&#8208;tumor toxicity of PROTAC.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tumor-specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem-activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on-tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor-homing cyclopeptide through a tandem-locking linker, which comprises a singlet-oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)-cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem-lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor-selective degradation of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem-activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off-tumor toxicity of PROTAC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Efficient near infrared (NIR) luminescence is highly important for modern optoelectronic fields. In their Research Article (e202505322), Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers fabricated new types of NIR optical waveguides based on transparent rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses using a facile self&#8208;assembly process. This work provides a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence sensitized lanthanide strategy to synthesize molecular glasses with color&#8208;tunable NIR luminescence and extends the function of NIR optical waveguiding into advanced photonic communications.

Enzymes are powerful catalysts. Unfortunately, computational enzyme design remains challenging. In their Research Article, H. Adrian Bunzel and co&#8208;workers develop AI.zymes (e202507031), a modular platform integrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational tools through evolutionary design. AI.zymes boost enzymes by optimizing biocatalytic features such as transition&#8208;state binding, protein stability, and electrostatic catalysis. Its modular architecture will facilitate the integration of emerging design algorithms and enable addressing diverse design challenges.

Ultra&#8208;stable gold nanoparticles, achieved via in situ free&#8208;radical polymerization, are reported by B. Xu et al. in their Communication (e202507954). The crosslinked polymer shell surrounding the nanoparticles enhances their stability and enables tunable surface functionalities, resulting in prolonged circulation in the bloodstream and improved tumor targeting in mice. These findings underscore their promising potential as leading candidates for gold&#8208;based nanomedical applications.

         <title>An Update: Enzymatic Synthesis for Industrial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalysis has become a sustainable and cost&#8208;competitive alternative to established chemical synthesis, enabling the enzyme&#8208;based production of not only commodity chemicals but (non&#8208;natural) amino acids, (rare) sugars, as well as synthetic nucleotides. These building blocks give access to highly complex molecules with versatile industrial and therapeutic applications.








Abstract
Supported by rapid technological advancements, biocatalytic applications have matured into sustainable, scalable, and cost&#8208;competitive alternatives to established chemical catalysis. This review presents the most recent examples of enzyme&#8208;based solutions for the manufacturing of molecules with extended carbon&#8211;carbon frameworks and multiple stereogenic centers at commercial scale, including peptide building blocks, (rare) sugars, synthetic (oligo)nucleotides, and terpenoids, such as (&#8211;)&#8208;Ambrox&#174;. Novel enzyme classes are highlighted along with their potential applications&#8212;the synthesis of DNA/RNA, the depolymerization of synthetic plastics, or fully enzymatic protection/deprotection schemes&#8212;pointing toward the diversification and broader industrial utilization of biocatalysis&#8208;based processes.

         <title>The Design of Chemically Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of chemically self&#8208;charging mechanisms and the recent progress in the design of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. The challenges and future prospects are also discussed for chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. This review offers insight into potential future directions in the design of innovative chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries are regarded as potential candidates for off&#8208;grid energy storage devices due to their environmental independence and simple construction. Although tremendous research efforts have been recently made to design chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries, a comprehensive review about them is still absent. This review describes the design principles of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries and their self&#8208;charging mechanism. The advances in their cathode materials mainly include transition&#8208;metal oxides or sulfides, Prussian blue analogues, and organic compounds. Subsequently, the strategies of enhancing chemically self&#8208;charging kinetics are highlighted, including the design of materials, selection of oxidants, and the introduction of catalysts. In addition, various applications of chemically self&#8208;charging batteries are also discussed in wearable electronic devices, low temperatures, and all&#8208;pH scenarios. In the final section, the challenges and future perspectives are presented for designing high&#8208;performance chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. It will shed light on the R&amp;D of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.

         <title>Metal Complexes Stimulating Immunogenic Pyroptosis as Burgeoning Antitumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis, elucidating their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities, and proposes the prevailing challenges and future opportunities in metal&#8208;based immunotherapy.








Abstract
The exploration of antitumor agents with diverse action mechanisms has become an important focus in both fundamental research and clinical oncology, driven by the need for more effective cancer therapies. Metal complexes, with their versatile chemical, photophysical, and biological properties, represent an ideal class of therapeutic and diagnostic candidates for investigating novel antitumor mechanisms. Recent advances have underscored their unique ability to trigger diverse cell death pathways. Among these, pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has garnered substantial attention because of its intrinsic link to antitumor immunity. This minireview focuses on the cutting&#8208;edge developments in antitumor metal complexes designed to induce pyroptosis and elucidates their pyroptosis&#8208;stimulating mechanisms across chemo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, sono&#8208; and targeted therapeutic modalities. By dissecting the interplay among pyroptosis induction, biological processes, such as inflammasome activation and gasdermin cleavage, and subsequent immune reprogramming, we provide a thorough overview of the action mechanisms of metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducers. This understanding has inspired the rational development of novel anticancer metal complexes that can remodel the tumor microenvironment and synergize with immunotherapies.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview focuses on the indirect and direct electrosynthesis of NH2OH. The outlook of performance improvement strategies including catalysts and reactor design is also provided. 








Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) serves as an important industrial feedstock. The conventional production and transportation of NH2OH requires harsh conditions. Recently, electrochemical hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing oxidative species, such as nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide (NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722;/NO), into NH2OH has been developed as a sustainable strategy. However, the over&#8208;hydrogenation product of ammonia is preferentially obtained under electroreduction condition. Thus, the rational design of catalysts structure is crucial to selective electrosynthesis of NH2OH. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH with emphasis on the design of catalysts structure. Electrochemical synthesis strategy we discussed is categorized by the existence form of product, including indirect electrosynthesis and direct electrosynthesis. Finally, the techno&#8211;economic analysis (TEA) of electrochemical NH2OH production and outlook of performance improvement strategies are carried out to further guide the optimization of reaction system.

         <title>Macrocyclic Peptide Probes for Immunomodulatory Protein CD59: Potent Modulators of Bacterial Toxin Activity and Antibody&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59, an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Crystallographic and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies reveal peptide CP&#8208;06 mimics the binding of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. Dimeric and lipidated CP&#8208;06 analogues control both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors via CD59 inhibition.








Abstract
CD59 is an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Despite its importance in complement regulation and bacterial pathogenesis, CD59 remains a challenging therapeutic target. Research to date has focused on antibody or protein&#8208;based strategies. Here we present a new approach to target CD59 using macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59. Through X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies, we identify key interactions that are essential for binding and activity. We find that the macrocyclic peptide CP&#8208;06 adopts a beta&#8208;hairpin structure and binds CD59 through an intermolecular beta&#8208;sheet, mimicking protein&#8211;protein interactions of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. We create dimeric and lipidated macrocyclic peptide conjugates as enhanced cell&#8208;active CD59 inhibitors and show that these probes can be used to modulate both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors. Together, our data provide a starting point for future development of macrocyclic peptides to target CD59 activity in diverse cellular contexts.

         <title>A Biodegradable Radical Polymer Enables High&#8208;Performance, Physically Transient Organic Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable radical polymer with intrinsic memristivity and on&#8208;demand physical transience is presented. We leverage the nonconjugated nature of the radical polymer for a systematic molecular engineering. The polymer enabled a high&#8208;performance organic memristive device comparable to inorganic transient memory devices, now equipped with additional functionalities including optical transparency, flexibility, biocompatibility, and the transience.








Abstract
Electronic devices often demand high reliability and longevity, but they also contribute significantly to electronic waste. Physically transient electronics have thus emerged as a promising alternative in future electronics, particularly in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. In these applications, memristive materials have gained significant attention for their potential to realize neuromorphic systems that offer energy&#8208;efficient, hardware&#8208;based parallel processing. By integrating memristive capabilities with transient behavior, this study bridges these two cutting&#8208;edge fields, creating materials that not only enable advanced computing but also dissociate sustainably. Additionally, we leverage the unique features of soft materials for their tunability, biocompatibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, which collectively enhance this integration. In this work, we first illustrate molecular engineering strategy on a radical polymer. We then proceed to two&#8208;terminal devices therefrom, which exhibit exceptional memory performance of &gt;106 on/off ratio, &gt;104 s state retention, and stability over 250 DC sweep cycles. A flexible, optically transparent, and physically transient crossbar arrays are also developed, which maintain the performance through &gt;3,000 bending cycles and fully dissociate in water at room temperature. This work represents an advancement toward a biorealistic platform with substantial multifunctionality, making it readily translatable to future wearable and implantable neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Photoinitiators for High&#8208;Efficiency Visible LED and Sunlight Polymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structured dyes enable efficient electron transfer with additives, thanks to their tailored architecture, making them ideal for high&#8208;performance photoinitiating systems. They allow the fabrication of high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects and exhibit outstanding performance under sunlight.








Abstract
This study presents the development and evaluation of five dyes with varying conjugated energy levels and donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structures as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Their photoinitiation efficiencies are systematically assessed under both visible&#8208;light LED and sunlight. Notably, the conversions reach up to 81% within just&#160;30&#160;s under sunlight, demonstrating the ultrafast and efficient polymerization capabilities of the dyes. The efficient electron transfer is facilitated by the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, where the conjugation is reduced or interrupted by the high distortion between the electron&#8208;withdrawing and the electron&#8208;releasing units. This distortion can prevent the overlap of frontier molecular orbitals, decreasing the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of dyes, thereby enhancing the electron transfer reactivity with additives. Additionally,&#160;we propose a chemical mechanism for the electron transfer reaction in the three&#8208;component systems. The study also explores the application of naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione&#8208;based dyes as donors in additive manufacturing demonstrating their effectiveness in three different 3D printing technologies, i.e., direct laser writing (DLW), digital light processing (DLP), and liquid crystal display (LCD). These three&#8208;component formulations achieve high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects, with detailed characterization and comparison of the resulting structures.

Abstract
A magical heterostructures of M&#8208;PBAs (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Cu, and Zn) encapsulated by V&#8208;PBA have been successfully obtained by a facile one&#8208;pot coprecipitation method based on the difference in the binding energies of between these metal ions and ligands, and the nucleation rates of different M&#8208;PBAs. Hence, due to the multiple redox pairs, open frameworks, ordered channels, and synergistic effect of two components, the obtained VM&#8208;PBAs have been tested as cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To further inhibiting the hydrolysis of vanadium ions and the collapse of PBAs structures, a series of glycerol&#8211;water hybrid electrolyte with different content of glycerol were designed. Benefiting from the multiple hydroxyl groups, appropriate viscosity and accurate proportion of glycerol, the as&#8208;assembled AZIBs with VMn&#8208;PBAs cathode can exhibit excellent cycling performance (&#8764;73% capacity retain of stable capacity) after 1000 cycles. This work provides a sight of preparation of PBAs nanomaterials and a strategy of improve the cycling stability and rate capacity of PBAs&#8208;based cathodes in AZIBs.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Peptide Nanofibers from a Structured Motif Within Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence (PQYQP), derived from the SRC protein, was combined with the self&#8208;assembly motif (Nap&#8208;FF) to produce intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies that form cell&#8208;compatible hydrogels via enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA).








Abstract
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous in proteins, orchestrating complex cellular signaling through higher&#8208;order protein assemblies. However, the properties and functions of intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies are largely underexplored. This work unveiled a facile strategy for engineering IDP assemblies. We demonstrate that conjugating a structured motif derived from a protein's phosphorylation site to a self&#8208;assembling tripeptide unexpectedly yields self&#8208;assembled nanofibers with intrinsic disorder. Specifically, by using a glycine linker to attach a pentapeptide derived from a phosphorylation site within a random coil region of SRC kinase to the C&#8208;terminus of a widely used self&#8208;assembling enabler, we generated a phosphorylated octapeptide. The octapeptide exhibits cell compatibility and forms a hydrogel upon dephosphorylation of the phosphooctapeptide. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structural analysis of the nanofibers reveals that the peptides adopt two types of helical arrangements but exhibit intrinsic disorder at the periphery of the nanofibers. The hydrogels exhibit decreased protein adsorption with increasing peptide concentration. This study represents the first instance of a structured random coil within a protein transitioning into an intrinsically disordered state within self&#8208;assembled peptide nanofibers, expanding the pool of peptide sequences for IDPs and providing valuable insights for the engineering of peptide nanofibers with intrinsic disorder for the development of cell&#8208;compatible biomaterials.

         <title>Natural Sunlight&#8208;Driven Activation of Inert Aryl Halides Using Plasmonic Cu@CdS with Polysulfide Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemists have long aspired to construct complex organic compounds the way that plants do by harnessing natural sunlight as an energy source. This study presents an advancement toward this goal via synergistic exploitation of the plasmonic absorption of Cu and the unique redox potentials of excited polysulfide species (S3&#8226;&#8722; and S42&#8722;) on semiconductor surfaces to decouple the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation.








Abstract
Visible light photoredox catalysis has become a rapidly emerging area owing to its potential of using sunlight to tame previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;harness radicals for organic synthesis. At present, such a blueprint faces a significant challenge, namely how to accomplish thermodynamically demanding reactions with sunlight encompassing a wide range of low&#8208;energy photons. Here, we report a new reaction framework to overcome this bottleneck through decoupling the thermodynamic limits of photoreduction from photoexcitation. This is fulfilled based on the construction of a heterogeneous photocatalyst Cu@CdS possessing in situ&#8208;formed surficial polysulfide species (including S3&#8226;&#8722; and S42&#8722;), which can efficiently harvest solar energy via plasmonic absorption of Cu while manifest sufficient redox potential for activating inert aryl bromides/chlorides enacted by excited polysulfides. We demonstrate that this designed material composes a potent photoredox catalyst for efficient aryl cross&#8208;coupling, borylation, hydrogenation, as well as Birch&#8208;type dearomatization reactions, with good recyclability and stability. In particular, when exclusively using natural sunlight as an energy source, the product yield can still reach up to 90%. Our findings introduce a straightforward yet viable way to progress toward the century&#8208;long dream of leveraging natural sunlight to produce structurally complex organic molecules, just like plants on Earth.

         <title>Engineering a Proximity Biosensor via Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel proximity biosensor was introduced based on the principle of constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC), achieving high binding affinity, low background, and robust performances for homogeneous antibody detection in both buffer and human serum samples.








Abstract
Affinity binding&#8208;induced DNA assembly is a fundamental principle for designing proximity biosensors for sensitive and wash&#8208;free protein detection and imaging. However, current design strategies for these biosensors face an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between binding affinity and background signal. Here, we demonstrate that this intrinsic issue can be addressed by using constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC) as a guiding principle in the rational design of proximity biosensors. As exists in a dynamic equilibrium, the constitutional dynamic network (CDN)&#8208;based proximity biosensors can be adjusted to maximize the affinity to the target protein while minimizing non&#8208;specific interactions that contribute to background signals. By further detecting the ratio of agonist to antagonist within the CDN, we also significantly improved assay robustness, enabling the sensitive detection of antibodies in complex matrices such as human serum. With the high affinity, low background, and high robustness, we anticipate that our CDN&#8208;based design strategy will find wide applications in biosensor development. Our study also opens the possibility to engineer protein&#8208;responsive synthetic systems with complex dynamic behaviors and functions.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Enable Improved Performance and Stability of Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonds and ionic liquids were used for the first time to regulate the phase distribution and release residual lattice strain of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites. The PFI&#8208;based halogen bond molecules achieve the regulation of the uniform and continuous phase distribution of DJ perovskite and adjust the lattice strain from the tensile strain to a smaller value of the compression strain. Eventually, the reverse bias stability of (PDMA)(MA)2Pb3I10&#8208;based DJ perovskite solar cells improved over 100 times.








Abstract
The undesired phase distribution and intrinsic residual lattice strain remain the bottleneck for high&#8208;performance and stable 2D or Q&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for the Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) type Q&#8208;2D PSCs. Here, we showcase employing halogen bonds to stabilize the halide anions and fine&#8208;tuning the residual lattice strain by introducing perfluorodecyl iodide (PFI). It reduces the density of iodide species defects and releases the residual tensile strain, leading to more homogenous phase distribution, suppressed carrier recombination, promoted charge transport, enhanced efficiency, and stability. Therefore, DJ PSCs maintain over 81% of initial efficiency after thermal&#8208;light aging (i.e., under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 1 sun illumination) for 952&#160;h, and remain over 91% of initial efficiency after under reverse bias (&#8722;2.5&#160;V, under ISOS&#8208;V aging tests) for over 21&#160;h, representing one of the most bias&#8208;stable Q&#8208;2D PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Active Transport</title>

We report a synthetic system that uses chemical potential differences similar to biological systems to transport small molecules across a hydrophobic barrier against a concentration gradient. Instead of a complex pumping machinery, transport happens through the transient activation of transporter molecules. Our reaction&#8208;diffusion model identified key parameters for efficient transport, enabling selective sorting of molecular mixtures.








Abstract
Biology uses chemical potential differences from molecules like ATP to drive membrane pumps, transporting molecules across membranes even against concentration gradients. Here, we report a synthetic system that transports small molecules from an aqueous phase (the sender) to an aqueous receiver across a centimeter&#8208;sized immiscible solvent at the expense of chemical energy. Molecules with high chemical potential (fuels) in the sender phase transiently activate the transporter molecules, which enter the immiscible solvent and exit on the receiver phase side, thus allowing transport from sender to receiver against a concentration gradient. Importantly, we show this active transport mechanism transports molecules across a hydrophobic barrier without complex pumping machinery. Using a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, we identify the critical parameters that determine the efficiency of active transport. Selective transport enables the sorting of a mixture of different molecules. In future work, we will use these design criteria to actively transport molecules across membranes, e.g., of vesicles, at the expense of chemical fuel, thereby mimicking biological processes and enabling the feeding of synthetic cells.

         <title>Bulk Measurement of Membrane Permeability for Random Cyclic Peptides in Living Cells to Guide Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some cyclic peptides can cross membranes, which is highly attractive for drug development, but it remains difficult to accurately predict membrane permeability or to test it experimentally for large numbers of peptides. Here, we present a strategy to measure the membrane permeability of hundreds of different cyclic peptides in parallel in live cells. In addition, we show that the data collected for many peptides are suitable for predicting membrane permeability.








Abstract
Cyclic peptides are attractive for drug discovery due to their excellent binding properties and the potential to cross cell membranes. However, by far, not all cyclic peptides are cell permeable, and measuring or predicting their membrane permeability is not trivial. In this work, we assessed the membrane permeability of thioether&#8208;cyclized peptides, a widely used format in drug discovery. We developed a strategy for synthesizing hundreds of cyclic peptides carrying a short chloroalkane tag for the bulk quantification of membrane permeability in live cells using the chloroalkane penetration assay. Permeability data for random cyclic peptides established design rules, indicating the probability of peptides entering cells is strongly increasing if the molecular weight is below 800&#160;Da, the polar surface is smaller than 250&#160;&#197;2, or if there are less than six hydrogen bond donors. From this, machine learning could predict the membrane permeability of random peptides with good confidence, facilitating the future development of membrane&#8208;permeable cyclic peptide drugs.

         <title>Protonated Glutamate and Aspartate Side Chains Can Recognize Phosphodiester Groups via Strong and Short Hydrogen Bonds in Biomacromolecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly negatively charged phosphodiester groups of nucleic acids and cyclic (di&#8208;)nucleotides often interact with amino acids containing polar or positively charged sidechains. Due to charge repulsion with their negatively charged carboxylate groups in their side chains, glutamate and aspartate are considered to be detrimental to such interactions. Here, we show that glutamate residues with pKa values shifted towards neutral pH due to their chemical environment are easily protonated and thus able to form strong hydrogen bonds with phosphodiester groups.








Abstract
Phosphodiester groups occur ubiquitously in nature, e.g. in nucleic acids or in cyclic (di&#8208;)nucleotides important for signal transduction. Proteins often use polar or positively charged amino acids to interact with the negatively charged phosphodiester groups via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. In contrast, the acidic amino acids aspartate and glutamate are generally not considered as important determinants for phosphodiester group recognition. Instead, they are regarded as detrimental to such interactions due to the assumed charge repulsion between their deprotonated, negatively charged side chain carboxylate groups and the phosphodiester. Accordingly, acidic amino acids are often purposefully introduced into proteins to abrogate nucleic acid interactions in functional studies. Here, we show that in appropriate structural contexts, glutamate side chains are readily protonated even at neutral pH and act as hydrogen bond donors to phosphodiester groups using a c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding protein &#8211; the GSPII&#8208;B domain of PilF from Thermus thermophilus &#8211; as an example. Surveying available RNA&#8208;protein and DNA&#8208;protein complex structures in the PDB, we found that hydrogen bonds between apparently protonated carboxylate groups of glutamate and aspartate and phosphodiester groups occur frequently in many different functional protein classes. Thus, the functional role of acidic amino acids in phosphodiester group recognition needs to be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>Organic Cage Encapsulated Within Metal Cluster&#8208;Based Open Frameworks: A Single&#8208;Crystal Host&#8208;in&#8208;Host Material with Inter&#8208;Host Charge Cooperation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic cage&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal host&#8208;in&#8208;host framework is constructed via electrostatic interactions between ammonium&#8208;bearing organic cages and lead iodide clusters. This precisely defined nested architecture facilitates interhost charge cooperation, remarkably enhancing the material's photophysical properties and establishing dual&#8208;host active sites that synergistically boost catalytic performance across a series of cascade reactions.








Abstract
Integrating dissimilar building units of discrete organic cages and inorganic clusters into single&#8208;crystal supramolecular frameworks with tailored architectures and synergistic functions presents a significant challenge. Here, we presented our discovery of achieving such hybrids through electrostatically driven self&#8208;assembly of cationic ammonium organic cages with anionic lead iodide clusters. Notably, by carefully modulating the size, shape, and composition of cationic organic cages, we have constructed an integrated porous host&#8208;in&#8208;host architecture. In this system, the internal cationic cage snugly resided, encapsulated within the external network constructed from anionic lead iodide clusters. This unique nested hierarchy showcased enhanced interhost interactions facilitated by electrostatic forces, which intricately tailored the electronic structure of the outer lead iodide moiety. As a result, the hybrid demonstrated distinguished photophysical properties, including efficient oxygen activation and enhanced photothermal conversion capability, as confirmed by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses. The critical role of interhost electrostatic interactions was further demonstrated through a systematic comparison with a structurally similar host&#8208;in&#8208;host architecture comprising lead iodide clusters and neutral amine cages. Furthermore, the integrated and compartmentalized dual&#8208;host served as spatially isolated dual active sites for cascade reactions, exhibiting 33&#8211;47&#8208;folds enhancement in activity compared to structural counterparts lacking charge cooperation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks at the Edge of Stability: Mediating Node Distortion to Access Metastable Nanoparticle Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ total scattering during nanoscale TiO2 formation from a MOF precursor shows that the local MOF node geometry is preserved in the nanoparticles formed under mild conditions. The node geometry depends on the chemical environment of the MOF, which can be tuned to increase the yield of nano&#8208;brookite, a TiO2 polymorph that is difficult to synthesize by traditional methods. Thus, this offers a new strategy to control nanoparticle synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as unconventional precursors for nanoparticle synthesis, with potential to leverage their tunable structures and chemistry to achieve nanomaterials with structures and compositions inaccessible via traditional synthetic routes. Here, we use in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements to investigate how the dynamic structure of MOFs at the edge of stability influences their transformation into different metastable polymorphs. Our study reveals that the local structural features of metal&#8208;oxo MOF nodes at elevated temperatures are linked to the resulting nanoparticle structures formed under mild conditions. Focusing on the titanium&#8208;based MOF MIL&#8208;125, we demonstrate that manipulating the chemical environment to facilitate transformation of the Ti8 node geometry promotes formation of metastable, nanometer&#8208;scale TiO2 brookite rather than the more common anatase and rutile TiO2 polymorphs typically produced through MOF pyrolysis at high temperature. These findings highlight the potential to harness the MOF topology and chemical environment to design and control node distortions and enable access to exotic metastable nanoparticle states.

         <title>LC&#8208;MS and High&#8208;Throughput Data Processing Solutions for Lipid Metabolic Tracing Using Bioorthogonal Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high&#8208;throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using bioorthogonal alkyne fatty acids and optimized LC&#8208;MS workflow. Applied to human fibrosarcoma cells, the method traced fatty acid metabolism, revealing nuances in sphingolipid routing and metabolic bottlenecks, highlighting its potential for lipidomics research.








Abstract
Tracing lipid metabolism in mammalian cells presents a significant technological challenge due to the vast structural diversity of lipids involved in multiple metabolic routes. Bioorthogonal approaches based on click chemistry have revolutionized analytical performance in lipid tracing. When adapted for mass spectrometry (MS), they enable highly specific and sensitive analyses of lipid transformations at the lipidome scale. Here, we advance this approach by integrating liquid chromatography (LC) prior to MS detection and developing a software&#8208;assisted workflow for high&#8208;throughput data processing.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high-throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using bioorthogonal alkyne fatty acids and optimized LC-MS workflow. Applied to human fibrosarcoma cells, the method traced fatty acid metabolism, revealing nuances in sphingolipid routing and metabolic bottlenecks, highlighting its potential for lipidomics research.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing lipid metabolism in mammalian cells presents a significant technological challenge due to the vast structural diversity of lipids involved in multiple metabolic routes. Bioorthogonal approaches based on click chemistry have revolutionized analytical performance in lipid tracing. When adapted for mass spectrometry (MS), they enable highly specific and sensitive analyses of lipid transformations at the lipidome scale. Here, we advance this approach by integrating liquid chromatography (LC) prior to MS detection and developing a software-assisted workflow for high-throughput data processing. LC separation resolved labeled and unmodified lipids, enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of both lipidome fractions, as well as isomeric lipid species. Using synthetic standards and endogenously produced alkyne lipids, we characterized LC-MS behavior, including preferential adduct formation and the extent of in-source fragmentation. Specific fragmentation rules, derived from tandem MS experiments for 23 lipid subclasses, were implemented in Lipostar2 software for high-throughput annotation and quantification of labeled lipids. Applying this platform, we traced metabolic pathways of palmitic and oleic acid alkynes, revealing distinct lipid incorporation patterns and metabolic bottlenecks. Altogether, here we provide an integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high-throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using LC-MS workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Electrocatalysts for Boosting Glycerol Upgrading Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D conjugated [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n MOF (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) with Ni&#8211;O4 node can be simultaneously utilised as a catalyst for glycerol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, showing high catalytic activity and selectivity. The in situ measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the reaction mechanism, active centres, and origin of outstanding performance.








Abstract
The valorisation of glycerol using renewable electricity is recognised as an effective and attractive approach for producing high&#8208;value compounds from biomass byproducts. 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts due to their tunable structures, high electronic conductivity, and efficient utilisation of well&#8208;defined active centres. In this study, we report the first systematic investigation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs containing Ni&#8208;X4 (X&#160;=&#160;O or N) moieties for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), examining key factors influencing both electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. In situ 13C electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies provide insights into the GOR mechanism and confirm that Ni&#8211;O4 sites are the primary active centres. Theoretical calculations further reveal that [Ni3(HHTQ)2]n (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline) exhibits superior GOR activity due to strong adsorption of reaction intermediates and weak interlayer interactions. This work highlights the potential of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as highly efficient GOR catalysts, paving the way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and contributing to the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies.

         <title>Scalable Main Group Mechanocatalytic CO2 Valorisation to Cyclocarbonate Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a scalable mechanocatalytic method for synthesizing cyclic carbonates from solid and liquid epoxides using CO&#8322; at 1 bar and room temperature. Employing a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst, this process achieves high yields, efficiently transforms multi&#8208;terminal epoxides, and outperforms solution&#8208;based methods in green metrics, setting a benchmark for sustainable synthesis.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, main group elements have gained attention as promising substitutes for precious metals in catalytic processes. Additionally, mechanochemistry is emerging as a field with the potential to promote catalytic reactions under mild conditions. Herein, we report a scalable, main&#8208;group mechanocatalytic synthesis of cyclic carbonates from both solid and liquid epoxides, using CO&#8322; as a renewable feedstock under mild conditions with a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst. Unlike solution&#8208;based methods that generally require high temperatures and/or high CO&#8322; pressures, this mechanocatalytic process operates at just 1 bar and room temperature. The developed mechanochemical method affords the targeted compounds in high yields while also enabling efficient transformation of multi&#8208;terminal epoxides and avoiding the conversion losses typically observed in solution. Furthermore, this scalable method outperforms solution&#8208;based approaches across all green metrics, setting a new benchmark for environmentally friendly synthesis.

         <title>Plasmonic Ion Diode Membrane (PIDM) for Enhanced Nanofluidic Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) using COFs and 3D AuNPs to overcome permselectivity and ion concentration polarization (ICP) limitations in nanofluidic ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting. The optimized PIDM achieves 65.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 power density, demonstrating a synergistic plasmonics&#8208;ion diode strategy for efficient energy conversion.









Abstract
Efficient applications of nanofluidic devices are often limited by the insufficient ion permselectivity and inherent ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) was designed and fabricated for enhanced ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting by integrating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and three&#8208;dimensional Au nanoparticles (3D AuNPs) into anode aluminum oxide (AAO). Under light irradiation, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation of 3D AuNPs can release huge plasmonic heat and produce abundant hot charge carriers (hot electrons and holes) simultaneously. The former heats the solution and generates a thermal gradient for boosting ion flux, while the latter transfers to the COFs layer, increasing charge density for promoting ion permselectivity. Importantly, it has been found that different COFs with varied pore sizes and charges have an obvious influence on energy harvesting efficiency. Under the optimum condition, a high output power density of 65.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 in a 500&#8208;fold concentration gradient could be achieved. This work provides a practical and efficient way to boost ion transport and enhance osmotic energy conversion by utilizing the synergistic effect of plasmonics and ion diode (ID) property.

         <title>Unprecedented Tetravalent Uranium Photocatalysts for Efficient C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) Bond Cleavage and Formation</title>

We report the discovery of the first tetravalent uranium photocatalyst that efficiently enables C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage and formation under visible light, providing a new platform for uranium&#8208;based photocatalysis and bond functionalization.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a pivotal area in synthetic chemistry. Despite extensive application potential in nuclear industry, uranium&#8208;based photocatalysts are historically limited to uranyl(VI/V) redox cycle. Here, we report the discovery of the first tetravalent uranium [U(IV)] photocatalyst that enables efficient C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage and formation under ideal visible light. The U(IV) alkoxy species mediates C&#9472;C bond cleavage in a wide range of cycloalkanols and promotes their coupling with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, providing access to previously unattainable molecular architectures. These U(IV) alkoxy complexes, fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and magnetic studies, exhibit exceptional photocatalytic efficiency. Quantum chemical studies reveal that the energy barrier for C&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation is reduced to below 10 kcal &#183; mol&#8722;1 under visible light excitation. This work introduces a new mechanistic paradigm for uranium&#8208;based photocatalysis and positions U(IV) alkoxy complexes as a versatile platform for bond activation and functionalization, expanding the potential applications of depleted uranium in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Structures for Enhanced Durability and Efficiency in Zinc&#8211;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a strategy to improve aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) by tuning Zn2+ solvation structures using a hydrogen bond&#8208;accepting cosolvent. This approach stabilizes pH, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and enhances Zn plating/stripping reversibility&#8212;offering a pathway to durable, high&#8208;efficiency ZBFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are among the most appealing technologies for large&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their scalability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, safety and sustainability. However, their long&#8208;term durability is challenged by issues like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendritic zinc electroplating. Herein, we address these challenges by reshaping the Zn2+ ion solvation structures in zinc bromide (ZnBr2) aqueous electrolytes using a robust hydrogen bond acceptor as a cosolvent additive. Our findings highlight the critical role of interactions within the first and second Zn2+ solvation shells in determining electrochemical performance. By selectively incorporating a low volume percentage of organic additive into the second coordination shell of Zn2+, we achieve effective proton capture, electrolyte pH stabilization during the Zn0 electroplating, and mitigation of ion transport resistance. This approach prevents the formation of a passivation interphase layer on the electrode surface, which typically occurs with higher additive concentrations, leading to increased interphase resistance and cell polarization. This work opens a new avenue in modulating Zn2+ reactivity and stability through precise solvation structure design, enabling efficient and reversible Zn0/2+ plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes with suppressed H2 evolution. These findings pave the way for the development of commercially viable, high&#8208;performance ZBFBs for energy storage applications.

         <title>Cyclic Trinuclear Units Based Covalent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three copper cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) bearing affinity functional groups are prepared. It has been demonstrated that the integration of multiple adsorption strategies into porous adsorbents, including adsorption, chemical reduction, and photocatalytic reduction can boost the overall performance of gold recovery.








Abstract
The development of porous solids for gold recovery is highly desired from both an economical and environmental point of view; however, the design of solid adsorbents with high overall performance is still challenging. Herein, we designed three copper(I) cyclic trinuclear units, Cu(I)&#8208;CTUs, based covalent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CMOFs) by networking metal clusters with dynamic covalent linkages. These CMOFs deliver a high gold adsorption capacity of 3687&#160;mg g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;fast adsorption kinetics (i.e., removal efficiency&#160;&gt;&#160;99% within&#160;20&#160;s), excellent selectivity and reusability. In addition, they can be readily used for gold extraction from e&#8208;waste. Owing to the rich redox properties of Cu&#8208;CTUs, these CMOFs show three sorption mechanisms including adsorption, chemical reduction and photocatalytic reduction. Interestingly, the gold&#8208;loaded CMOFs can be used as catalysts for hydration of alkynes to ketones with high yields (e.g., up to &#8764; 95% for 6 examples).

         <title>Integrative Lattice and Surface Engineering of Nanoscale Fe0 for Superior Dechlorination of Trichloroethene in Groundwater: Coordination in Reactivity, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice and surface engineering strategy was employed to synthesize a novel core&#8208;shell nanomaterial for superior reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene. In this design, FeNi serves as the core and FeS as the shell. Core composition and shell properties interactively determine materials&#8217; performance, and the optimal material exhibited 242.7&#8208;fold higher reactivity and 81.2&#8208;fold greater selectivity compared to the unmodified counterpart.








Abstract
Nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nFe0) materials hold great promise in environmental remediation, yet achieving high reactivity, selectivity, and stability in reduction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we address this challenge by employing Ni lattice and FeS surface engineering to fabricate novel nFe0&#8208;based nanomaterials (dubbed as FeNix@FeSy), featuring FeNi as the core and FeS as the shell. The FeNi5@FeS10 delivered approximately 242.7&#8208; and 81.2&#8208;times higher reactivity and selectivity, respectively, over unmodified nFe&#176; for the remediation of trichloroethene (TCE; a notorious environmental pollutant), while maintaining high stability in groundwater remediation. We found that the core composition (i.e., Ni/Fe ratio) of FeNix@FeSy primarily determined reactivity, governed by a tradeoff between the galvanic effect and lattice strain, while shell properties mainly controlled selectivity, despite some interactions between them. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the FeS surface served as a favorable adsorption site for TCE, and the low energy barriers (TS2, 0.19&#160;eV) of FeNi5@FeS10 facilitated the cleavage of the first chlorine from TCE. Moreover, the core&#8208;shell structure promoted electron transfer from the core to the shell and TCE. This integrative lattice and surface engineering strategy provides a new avenue for designing advanced functional materials for environmental remediation and beyond.

         <title>Introducing Photochemical Action Plots as a Tool for Unlocking On&#8211;Off Switchable Behavior in a Polymeric Eosin Y Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8211;Kowollik team provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the wavelength dependence of light&#8208;driven reactions. Herein, the methodology is applied to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots. The insights gained from the photocatalytic action plot analysis enable on&#8208;off switching of the activity of a polymeric photocatalyst.








Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for investigating the wavelength&#8208;dependent efficiency of photochemical processes. Herein, we apply the photochemical action plot methodology developed by the Barner&#8211;Kowollik team to a photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the first examples of photocatalytic action plots, paving the way for future in&#8208;depth explorations of the wavelength dependence of similar reactions. Specifically, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the catalytic oxidation capabilities of an Eosin Y functionalized polymer photocatalyst (P1) as well as a small molecule representative of the polymer bound Eosin Y moieties (EY) for the oxidation of triphenylphosphine. Introduction of zinc(II) ions into the system proved to drastically influence the optical absorption properties of both catalysts, accompanied by a pronounced influence on their wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity profiles which is not predictable based on the absorption spectra. For P1, these changes can be reversed by metal&#8208;mediated single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) formation upon base addition, giving access to a stimuli&#8208;responsive polymeric photocatalyst. Detailed analysis of the photocatalytic action plots enabled the identification of a suitable wavelength for the realization of an on&#8208;off switchable polymeric photocatalytic system.

Covalent drugs have experienced a revival for anticancer therapies. The balance among selectivity, reactivity, and potency is indispensable for safe and effective drugs. On&#8208;membrane assemblies synergize a bioorthogonal cleavage reaction to regulate the influx of a classical covalent inhibitor, Melphalan, confirming that targeted Ebioorthogonal prodrugs confer cell selectivity to covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency.








Abstract
Covalent drugs have experienced a revival in recent decades due to their advantageous pharmacodynamic profiles and targeting of &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins. However, balancing selectivity, reactivity, and potency is essential for safe and effective drugs. Here, we employ a cell&#8208;selective bioorthogonal prodrug design to enhance the selectivity for covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency. The upregulation of phosphatase and integrin facilitates the formation of enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular assemblies (EISA) on the cancer cell membrane. These assemblies localize bioorthogonal reaction handles tetrazine (Tz), which liberate Melphalan from its bioorthogonal prodrug TCO&#8208;Mel. The TCO modification disrupts the LAT1&#8208;mediated transportation, reducing cellular permeability of TCO&#8208;Mel and the corresponding cytotoxicity to normal cells. Although the cell&#8208;selective on&#8208;membrane assemblies directed prodrug activation restores Melphalan influx to inhibit cancer cell growth. This prodrug activation strategy further demonstrates potent tumor suppression with satisfactory biocompatibility in vivo. Overall, we extend the scope of bioorthogonal prodrug design for covalent drugs via regulating cellular influx of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;Embedded 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Quasi&#8208;Honeycomb Lattice for High&#8208;Capacitance Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

A Cu&#8208;OHDDQP 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) was synthesized possessing a unique quasi&#8208;honeycomb topology, from a pyrazine&#8208;fused, D2&#8208;symmetric ligand. The achieved 2D c&#8208;MOF electrode displayed a remarkable gravimetric capacitance up to 452 A g&#8722;1 for electrochemical lithium storage. Supported by theory and the spectroscopic experiments, the role of the backbone&#8208;embedded pyrazine moieties is unveiled, showing they can offer extra sites for both lithium adsorption and pseudocapacitive charge storage.








Abstract
As a unique class of framework electronic materials, 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibit intrinsic porosity, superior electrical conductivity, and abundant active sites. These properties endow them with great potential in electrochemical lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the development of 2D c&#8208;MOF&#8208;based capacitors has encountered a bottleneck in enhancing Li&#8208;ion storage capacitance, and the design of high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrode materials has remained a challenge. Herein, we synthesize a Cu&#8208;OHDDQP (octahydroxy&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]dibenzo[5,6:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]phenazine) 2D c&#8208;MOF with a quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice by employing a nonplanar D2&#8208;symmetric conjugated ligand embedding redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties. The quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice features a dual&#8208;porous tessellation of C6&#8208;symmetric and C3&#8208;symmetric pores. Notably, when utilized as active material for electrochemical lithium storage, Cu&#8208;OHDDQP achieves a record&#8208;high gravimetric specific capacitance among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs of 452 F g&#8722;1 in aqueous lithium electrolyte,&#160;along with a decent cycling stability of 90% after 1000 cycles. Such high capacitance is attributed to both the quasi&#8208;honeycomb lattice leading to higher surface area and the redox&#8208;active pyrazine moieties offering extra lithium&#8208;adsorption sites and associated pseudocapacitance. This work demonstrates that rational ligand design enables high&#8208;capacitance MOF electrodes materials, highlighting the potential of conductive MOFs for electrochemical energy technologies.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Functional Polyacetals via Controlled Cascade Enyne Metathesis Polymerization: Tunable Degradability, Postpolymerization Modification, and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a versatile platform to access functional polyacetals from stereochemically defined monomers. The polymerization exhibited living character and broad functional group tolerance. Rational monomer design enabled tunable hydrolysis rate and photodegradability. Polymer structures were elaborated by postpolymerization modification, preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers and amphiphilic copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We present a versatile platform for the synthesis of functional polyacetals from sugar and furfuryl alcohol derivatives using controlled cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. A range of monomers with defined stereochemistry were explored that featured broad functional group tolerance. The polymerization showed living character and permitted preparation of functionalized polyacetals with targetable molecular weights and more complex architectures. In addition, by harnessing the chiral nature of starting materials, the method granted facile access to chiral polyacetals. Modulation of regiochemical and substituent factors around the acetal motif conferred tunable hydrolysis rate, as well as photodegradability when installed with an ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl group. The polymer structure was further elaborated by postpolymerization modification via leveraging the reactivity of suitable pendent groups and preparation of fully degradable bottlebrush polymers via graft&#8208;through polymerization. Further utilities of the method were showcased by the preparation of amphiphilic copolymers with complete degradability that exhibited self&#8208;assembly behaviors through copolymerization.

         <title>Thrombus Boring Microrobot Prepared by an Integrated Phase Separation and Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly Process Toward Thrombolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process to fabricate urokinase plasminogen activator&#8208;modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), composed of microspheres capped with dual&#8208;layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles and cilia nanostructures. The uTBMs allowed for thrombus targeting, fibrin degradation, and controllable rotation to excavate blood cells under magnetic field, for efficient thrombolysis.








Abstract
The pathological formation of thrombi is the primary etiological factor of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, accounting for one&#8208;quarter of global fatalities. Traditional thrombolytic drugs are constrained by short half&#8208;life, low utilization, and severe complications. Inspired by the tunnel boring machine to excavate strata into small rocks, we report urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)&#8208;modified thrombus boring microrobots (uTBMs), prepared by a one&#8208;step integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process, for effective thrombolysis. The uTBMs are composed of microspheres capped with dual&#8208;layered structures of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and cilia nanostructures. In situ observation reveals the integrated phase separation and interfacial self&#8208;assembly process of the uTBM within an emulsion droplet. The capped layer of MNPs allows for controllable motion and rotation behavior under the manipulation of a remote magnetic field. The uPA&#8208;modified cilia nanostructures grasp and degrade the fibrin network, synergizing with the uTBMs rotation to mechanically excavate blood cells from thrombus individually, achieving &#8764;8.5&#8208;fold higher thrombolytic efficacy than uPA alone. This research demonstrates the feasibility of controllably fabricating and modifying complex&#8208;structured microrobots via the simple process toward potential thrombus therapy.

         <title>Chiroptical Signal Inversion of Peptido&#8208;Coassemblies in Confined Parallel&#8208;Laminar Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous parallel&#8208;laminar microfluidic strategy enables precise control over the chiroptical signals of peptide&#8208;based co&#8208;assemblies. The confined flow environment manipulates non&#8208;covalent interactions, achieving chiral signal inversion compared to conventional methods. This work presents a novel approach for supramolecular chirality regulation and dynamic chiral material design.








Abstract
Chirality plays a vital role in material properties, and precise control of chiral signals is key to designing functional materials. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly offers an efficient means to integrate chiral building blocks with chromophores, yet controlling the assembly pathway remains challenging due to the complexity of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Here, we introduce a continuous parallel&#8208;laminar&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy that exploits solvent ordering and solute diffusion in confined environments to regulate chiral signals in multi&#8208;component peptide co&#8208;assemblies.

&lt;p&gt;A continuous parallel-laminar microfluidic strategy enables precise control over the chiroptical signals of peptide-based co-assemblies. The confined flow environment manipulates non-covalent interactions, achieving chiral signal inversion compared to conventional methods. This work presents a novel approach for supramolecular chirality regulation and dynamic chiral material design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality plays a vital role in material properties, and precise control of chiral signals is key to designing functional materials. Supramolecular self-assembly offers an efficient means to integrate chiral building blocks with chromophores, yet controlling the assembly pathway remains challenging due to the complexity of non-covalent interactions. Here, we introduce a continuous parallel-laminar-assisted self-assembly strategy that exploits solvent ordering and solute diffusion in confined environments to regulate chiral signals in multi-component peptide co-assemblies. Notably, six nonpolar amino acids exhibit significantly enhanced chiroptical responses, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. Intriguingly, &lt;b&gt;Fmoc-Ala&lt;/b&gt; and 1-aminopyrene (&lt;b&gt;AP&lt;/b&gt;) co-assemblies formed in a microfluidic chip show a reversed chiroptical signal compared to those from batch reactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and COMSOL modeling suggest that velocity gradients and shear forces in microfluidics induce ordered non-covalent interactions, altering excimer stacking and modulating chiroptical properties. This study presents an effective strategy for controlling chiral optical signals in confined environments, offering an interesting approach for supramolecular chiral transfer and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Arylative Dearomatization of Naphthols and Phenols for Constructing Quinazoline&#8208;Containing Spirocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional quinazoline&#8208;containing spiro&#8208;cyclohexadienone through palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylative dearomatization is reported. This transformation demonstrated a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The antiproliferative activity against hematological malignancy cell lines is evaluated, demonstrating that (S)&#8208;4ac is a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylative dearomatization of phenols and naphthols, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. This approach enables the efficient construction of a diverse library of quinazoline&#8208;containing spirocyclic compounds, featuring enantioenriched, three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures through the strategic integration of quinazolinone and spirocyclic frameworks. The successful transformation of planar aromatic precursors into complex three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures using our developed methodology was further validated by principal moment of inertia (PMI) calculations. Additionally, we systematically evaluated the antiproliferative potential of the synthesized compounds against two representative cancer cell lines: Mino (human mantle cell lymphoma) and MV4&#8208;11 (human acute myeloid leukemia), revealing that compound (S)&#8208;4ac, characterized by well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and structural novelty, exhibited significantly enhanced antiproliferative efficacy against both cancer cell lines, with IC50 values 0.9&#160;&#181;M and 0.5&#160;&#181;M, respectively. In addition, flow cytometry quantification and western blot analysis showed that these compounds induced apoptosis through caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results demonstrated (S)&#8208;4ac as a highly promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.

         <title>Harnessing Lithium&#8208;Mediated Green Ammonia Synthesis with Water Electrolysis Boosted by Membrane Electrolyzer with Polyoxometalate Proton Shuttles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a sustainable approach to ammonia synthesis by integrating lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) with water electrolysis (WE). Polyoxometalates (POMs) serve as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs), enhancing proton transfer while suppressing hydrogen evolution. A three&#8208;compartment flow reactor achieves continuous ammonia production, setting a benchmark for eco&#8208;friendly nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Integrating water electrolysis (WE) with lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a sustainable route for green ammonia production by directly utilizing protons from water oxidation, eliminating reliance on grey or blue hydrogen. Here, polyoxometalates (POMs) function as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs) to seamlessly link WE with Li&#8208;NRR in a three&#8208;compartment flow reactor comprising an aqueous anode, an organic cathode, and a gas feed chamber. POMs serve as proton shuttles while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), facilitating efficient ammonia synthesis. The addition of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) enhances catholyte hydrophobicity, mitigating water contamination. By optimizing ECPB concentration, a dynamic balance is achieved between lithium nitride intermediates (LiNxHy) formation and consumption, yielding ammonia at 573.7&#160;&#177;&#160;5.2&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 54.2%. This design advances flow reactor technology by uniquely utilizing water oxidation as a direct proton source, bypassing conventional hydrogen oxidation methods. The use of POMs as proton shuttles establishes a new benchmark for green ammonia production, reinforcing its potential in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>In Situ &#8220;Confocal&#8221; Electrochemiluminescence 3D Imaging: From Cell to Tissue Section</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ &#8220;confocal&#8221; electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging method with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution was developed by in situ regulating the homogeneous reaction fluxes on electrode interface, in which the axial position of the ECL focal plane can be regulated from 0 to 63&#160;&#181;m, and even extends to 400&#160;&#181;m. The spatial imaging capability of the 3D ECL imaging method has been validated by the ECL sectioning imaging the topographies of single cells, cell clusters, and tissue sections.








Abstract
Endowing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technique with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution to investigate specimens at varying axial depths poses a challenging yet significant objective. Herein, a &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was developed using luminol as ECL probe, in which excited luminophore was formed in the vicinity of electrode surface through homogeneous chemical reactions between oppositely diffusing ECL precursors, luminol diazaquinone intermediate (L), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), confining the ECL emission in a thin plane (ECL focal plane) parallel to electrode surface at their intersection. The regulating ability of electrochemical method on the reaction fluxes of L and H2O2 was validated, regulating the axial location of the ECL focal plane from 0 to 63 &#181;m, which can even extend to 400 &#181;m by using the stable coreactant of ClO&#8722;. Leveraging the optical sectioning capability of the ECL focal plane, the &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was applied to bioimaging, from cells to tissue sections. It revealed cellular morphology changes during cell polarity establishment and the heterogeneous distribution of complex tubule structure in kidney tissue sections. The optical sectioning capability of &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging makes it a powerful tool for studying complex biological samples.

         <title>A Carboxylate&#8208;based Hydrophilic Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with a Large Molecular Dipole Moment for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ester hydrolysis to remove the side chain, a carboxylate&#8208;functionalized hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th, was obtained. The carboxylates significantly amplify the molecular dipole moment, creating a giant built&#8208;in electric field within the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction photocatalyst. This facilitates ultrafast exciton dissociation and efficient charge transport, thereby enhancing hydrogen evolution activity and stability.








Abstract
Achieving ultrafast dissociation of photogenerated excitons and efficient charge transport within the photocatalyst is a fundamental issue. Additionally, enhancing the interaction between semiconductors and water is crucial for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate&#8208;based hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th. Exposed carboxylates enhance semiconductor&#8208;water interfacial compatibility, reducing contact resistance and accelerating charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the carboxylate substitution shifts polarity centers, amplifying the molecular dipole moment by 10&#8208;fold. This induces a giant built&#8208;in electric field, enabling ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer process (ca. 0.31 ps) in the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction. Consequently, the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM&#8208;based bulk heterojunction nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 111.5 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, four times over the ester&#8208;based counterpart (PTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM). Moreover, the electrostatic stability imparted by the carboxylates endows hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM with outstanding operational stability, maintaining 81% of its initial hydrogen evolution rate after 100&#160;h operation. This result places it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction photocatalysts in terms of stability. This work establishes a molecular engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction photocatalysts, emphasizing synergistic optimization of hydrophilicity, dipole engineering, and interfacial dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;Achieving ultrafast dissociation of photogenerated excitons and efficient charge transport within the photocatalyst is a fundamental issue. Additionally, enhancing the interaction between semiconductors and water is crucial for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate-based hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7-Th. Exposed carboxylates enhance semiconductor-water interfacial compatibility, reducing contact resistance and accelerating charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the carboxylate substitution shifts polarity centers, amplifying the molecular dipole moment by 10-fold. This induces a giant built-in electric field, enabling ultrafast electron-transfer process (ca. 0.31 ps) in the hPTB7-Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction. Consequently, the hPTB7-Th:PCBM-based bulk heterojunction nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 111.5 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, four times over the ester-based counterpart (PTB7-Th:PCBM). Moreover, the electrostatic stability imparted by the carboxylates endows hPTB7-Th:PCBM with outstanding operational stability, maintaining 81% of its initial hydrogen evolution rate after 100&#160;h operation. This result places it among the state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction photocatalysts in terms of stability. This work establishes a molecular engineering strategy for high-performance bulk heterojunction photocatalysts, emphasizing synergistic optimization of hydrophilicity, dipole engineering, and interfacial dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bayesian Meta&#8208;Learning for Few&#8208;Shot Reaction Outcome Prediction of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian meta&#8208;learning framework is proposed for reaction outcome prediction in low&#8208;data settings. It utilizes a literature&#8208;mined dataset on asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins to build a pre&#8208;trained model. This meta&#8208;model is shown to return better predictions as compared to single&#8208;tasks methods, such as random forest and graph neural networks, given minimal training data.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the increasing application of machine learning (ML) in chemical reaction development. These ML methods, in general, require huge training set examples. The published literature has large amounts of data, but there are modelling challenges due to the sparse nature of these datasets. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;learning workflow that can utilize the literature&#8208;mined data and return accurate predictions with limited data. A literature dataset comprising of over 12&#160;000 transition metal catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins (AHO) is chosen to demonstrate the utility of our protocol. A meta&#8208;model is trained in a binary classification setting to identify highly enantioselective AHO reactions. Two Bayesian meta&#8208;learning approaches are considered, namely, deep kernel transfer (DKT) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF). Both these methods returned better predictions compared to prototypical network, which is another popular meta&#8208;learning approach. Single&#8208;task methods, such as random forest, graph neural network, and deep kernel learning, performed worse than meta&#8208;learning methods even when trained on full training data. Additionally, we propose another meta&#8208;learning approach called ADKF&#8208;prior that is shown to further improve the performance in low&#8208;data settings. The generalizability of our meta&#8208;model is also evaluated on substrate&#8208; and time&#8208;based splits. Our meta&#8208;learning workflow can be utilized to build a pretrained meta&#8208;model for any reaction of interest, which can then be useful to predict the outcome of new but related reactions in a few&#8208;shot manners.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron and Oxygen Coordination on Ruthenium Clusters for Industrial Water Splitting in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density boron&#8211;oxygen bi&#8208;coordinated ruthenium clusters have been successfully synthesized. The resultant RuC&#8211;B&#8211;O/rGO composites exhibit promising potential for application in industrial water electrolysis.








Abstract
The alteration in the coordination environment of metal atoms can manipulate their electronic structure and regulate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. In this work, synchrotron radiation tests prove that the boron (B) and oxygen (O) elements co&#8208;coordinate with ruthenium clusters (RuC) on the surface of B&#8211;O modified reduced graphene oxide. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that this unique structure electrocatalyst presents an overpotential of 12&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH condition and for over 120&#160;h at the current of &#8722;1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating potential practical applications. The quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the B&#8211;O diatomic coordination can modulate the synergy between the substrate and the RuC catalytic site, enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity and ion migration efficiency. The first principles calculation further proves that B&#8211;O diatomic coordination will reduce the desorption barrier of H* and construct a complete hydrogen migration path. This study discloses the significance of the synergistic effect of two anions to enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst by altering the coordination environment of ruthenium clusters.

         <title>Hyperpolarization Modulation of the T&#8208;Type hCav3.2 Channel by Human Synenkephalin [1&#8211;53], a Shrew Neurotoxin Analogue without Paralytic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN), an analogue peptide of shrew saliva neurotoxins, was synthesized and its structural characteristics studied. Synthetic hSYN potently activated the T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated Ca channel hCav3.2 but did not paralyze mealworms. These findings offer new insight into neurological disorder treatment and evolutionary mechanisms of venom peptides in mammals.








Abstract
Mammalian secreted venoms mainly consist of peptides and proteases used for defense or predation. Blarina paralytic peptides (BPPs), mealworm&#8208;targeting neurotoxins from shrew, are very similar to human synenkephalin. This peptide is released from proenkephalin in the brain along with opioid peptides that mediate analgesic and antidepressant effects, though its physiological function is unclear. Here, we synthesized and characterized human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN) and reveal its disulfide bond connectivity. Similar to BPP2, hSYN caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the human T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated calcium channel (hCav3.2) at 0.74&#160;&#181;M, but did not paralyze mealworms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that hSYN and BPP2 interact with hCav3.2 channel differently, due to differences in polar residues. Since Cav3.2 channel regulates neuronal excitability and is implicated in conditions like autism and epilepsy, our findings on hSYN could provide insight into the channel gating and agonistic mechanisms, along with potential pathways for developing treatments for neurological disorders.

         <title>Metathetical Exchange, Synthesis, and Carbon Dioxide Addition of Higher Homologues of Group 9 Metal Carbynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy carbynes of Group 9 metals is presented. Furthermore, in a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride.








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy homologues of Group 9 metal carbynes [(Me3P)3Co&#8801;GeAr*] (1), [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;GeAr*] (2), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;GeAr*] (3), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;SnAr*] (5), and [(Et3P)3Ir&#8801;PbAr*] (7) is presented [Ar* = C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(Trip)2, Trip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3]. During these preparations, the tetrylidynes [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (4), and [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (6), were also prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]&#8208;fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar&#160;=&#160;Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (2&#8211;5) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me3P)3(CO)M&#8208;E(&#951;2&#8208;O2CO&#8208;&#954;2O)Ar*] [E&#160;=&#160;Ge, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (11); M&#160;=&#160;Ir (12); E&#160;=&#160;Sn, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (14), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (16)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the Group 14 element. For tin the intermediates formed by mono CO2 addition [(Me3P)3M(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O)SnAr*] [M&#160;=&#160;Rh (13), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (15)] have been isolated.

&lt;p&gt;A one-pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy homologues of Group 9 metal carbynes [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&#8801;GeAr*] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rh&#8801;GeAr*] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&#8801;GeAr*] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&#8801;SnAr*] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), and [(Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&#8801;PbAr*] (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) is presented [Ar* = C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-2,6-(Trip)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Trip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. During these preparations, the tetrylidynes [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), were also prepared in a one-pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P{&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]-fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar&#160;=&#160;Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)M-E(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;)Ar*] [E&#160;=&#160;Ge, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;); M&#160;=&#160;Ir (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;); E&#160;=&#160;Sn, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (&lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (&lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the Group 14 element. For tin the intermediates formed by mono CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; addition [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Engineering Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Selective Acid Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of bipolar covalent organic framework membranes with tunable charge distributions is fabricated, demonstrating a significant rectification effect and an internal electric field. These features promote the translocation of NO3&#8722;, which has a low valence and dispersed charge density, resulting in a higher transmembrane diffusion coefficient than its self&#8208;diffusion rate. This enhances the selective extraction of NO3&#8722; from mixed waste.








Abstract
Nitric acid (HNO3) is a vital industrial chemical, and its recovery from complex waste streams is essential for sustainability and resource optimization. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of bipolar covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ionic site distributions as a solution for this challenge. The membranes are fabricated by layering anionic COF nanosheets on cationic COF layers, supported by a porous substrate. The resulting membranes exhibit significant rectifying behavior, driven by the asymmetric charge polarity and the intrinsic electric field, which enhances HNO3 transport. The transmembrane diffusion coefficient of 2.74&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1 exceeds the self&#8208;diffusion rate of NO3&#8722;, leading to increased HNO3 flux and selectivity compared to the individual anionic and cationic COF membranes. The optimized bipolar membrane configuration achieves remarkable separation factors, ranging from 22 to 242,000 for HNO&#8323;, in comparison to other solutes such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, and various metal salts in an eight&#8208;component mixed waste stream. This results in a substantial increase in HNO&#8323; purity, from 12.5% to 94.1% after a single membrane separation. With the broad range of COF materials and the versatility of the proposed membrane design, this work represents a significant advancement in chemical separation technologies.

         <title>Nitrate Reduction for Deaminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a one&#8208;step deaminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling of anilines via fleeting diazonium intermediate with nitrate and bisulfite as the reagents. This represents the first application of the nitrate reduction strategy in transition metal catalysis of diazonium chemistry. The reaction utilizes low&#8208;hazard, readily available starting materials and reagents. Our method demonstrates a simpler and safer procedure, together with the advantage of functional group tolerance and potential application in the arylation of various aniline&#8208;containing complex molecules.








Abstract
We present a deaminative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling (SMC) of anilines with nitrate as a diazotization reagent, which integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with nitrate&#8208;based diazonium chemistry for the first time. The synergistic reduction of nitrate by bisulfite and boronic acids allows for both oxidative diazotization with low&#8208;valent transition metal redox transformations simultaneously. The reaction utilizes low&#8208;hazard, readily available starting materials and reagents. In comparison to previous diazonium&#8208;based Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;couplings, the in situ oxidation of anilines by reduction of nitrate allows larger functional group tolerance.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones Enabled by a Carboxylic Acid Additive Promotion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to ligand acceleration and substrate direction strategies, this work introduces a third method to improve the efficiency of asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation, namely additive promotion. The carboxylic acid additive not only improves the reductive activity of the carbonyl group on the substrate but also improves the coordination of the hydroxyl group on the substrate and optimizes the stereocontrol environment of the key transition state so as to realize the highly efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl ketones.








Abstract
Highly enantioselective hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones was achieved by applying the catalytic combination of cobalt acetate and chiral Ph&#8208;BPE ligand, supplemented by a carboxylic acid additive promotion strategy. The carboxylic acid additive significantly increases both reactivity and enantioselectivity, allowing for the highly efficient generation of chiral 1,2&#8208;diols with up to 99% ee. The application utility is proved through derivations and a total synthesis of (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;eliprodil. Mechanistic studies, including control experiments and DFT calculations, support the proposed catalytic mechanism and explain the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Phosphorescent Iridium(III) Phenanthrolinedione Complexes as Lifetime&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Probes for Wash&#8208;Free Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging of Cellular Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes exhibiting sensitive phosphorescence responses, particularly lifetime changes, to bioorthogonal reactions with &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone&#8208;modified biomolecules. These complexes enabled wash&#8208;free, time&#8208;resolved bioimaging of bioorthogonal labeling in living cells. The lifetime&#8208;based readout provides multi&#8208;dimensional data, facilitating spatiotemporal monitoring of the labeling process.








Abstract
Fluorogenic bioorthogonal probes are crucial tools in biomedical research, which enable non&#8208;invasive, wash&#8208;free imaging of specific biomolecules in living systems. Lifetime&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal probes represent another promising and attractive alternative, offering the potential for real&#8208;time, wash&#8208;free visualization of bioorthogonal labeling processes via photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). However, their widespread application is limited by the lack of suitable lifetime&#8208;responsive probes. Herein, a series of phosphorescent iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes were reported. Intriguingly, upon bioorthogonal reaction with an &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone derivative, the complexes exhibited remarkable emission responses in three distinct manners, which were found to correlate with the different emissive excited states of the complexes. Crucially, two of the complexes maintained similar emission intensity but exhibited significant emission lifetime elongation during labeling reactions, which facilitated simultaneous and discriminative visualization of the reacted and unreacted probes in cellular imaging without the need for washing steps. One of the complexes was used for organelle targeting and specific protein labeling through bioorthogonal reactions in living cells. The intracellular probe transportation and labeling dynamics were visualized and analyzed using PLIM. This work highlights the unique potential of lifetime&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes as powerful chemical tools for live&#8208;cell imaging and unveiling the spatiotemporal dynamics of biomolecules during bioorthogonal reactions.

Lifetime-responsive bioorthogonal probes represent another promising and attractive alternative, offering the potential for real-time, wash-free visualization of bioorthogonal labeling processes via photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). However, their widespread application is limited by the lack of suitable lifetime-responsive probes. Herein, a series of phosphorescent iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes were reported. Intriguingly, upon bioorthogonal reaction with an &#945;-angelica lactone derivative, the complexes exhibited remarkable emission responses in three distinct manners, which were found to correlate with the different emissive excited states of the complexes. Crucially, two of the complexes maintained similar emission intensity but exhibited significant emission lifetime elongation during labeling reactions, which facilitated simultaneous and discriminative visualization of the reacted and unreacted probes in cellular imaging without the need for washing steps. One of the complexes was used for organelle targeting and specific protein labeling through bioorthogonal reactions in living cells. The intracellular probe transportation and labeling dynamics were visualized and analyzed using PLIM. This work highlights the unique potential of lifetime-responsive iridium(III) complexes as powerful chemical tools for live-cell imaging and unveiling the spatiotemporal dynamics of biomolecules during bioorthogonal reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De Novo Design of Structure&#8208;Tunable Multivalent Targeting Chimeras for Tumor&#8208;Targeted PD&#8208;L1 Degradation and Potentiated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) was presented for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs were synthesized by copolymerization of PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with various acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The multi&#8208;TACs with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity highly efficiently abolished PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology holds significant potential for modulating protein homeostasis and treating diseases. However, current methods for degrading membrane proteins highly depend on the lysosome&#8208;targeting ligands or membrane receptors. In this study, we present a set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs are synthesized by copolymerization of small&#8208;molecule PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The chemical structures of the multi&#8208;TACs are optimized by investigating the correlation between PD&#8208;L1 degradation efficacy and the key parameters, including acid&#8208;sensitive moieties, BMS&#8208;1 valency, and spacer length. Mechanistic study reveals that the multi&#8208;TACs highly efficiently degrade PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways, which differ from the reported strategies for membrane protein degradation. The outperformed multi&#8208;TAC GG56 with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity dramatically reduces PD&#8208;L1 levels and suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast tumors. Furthermore, GG56 serves as a versatile nanoplatform for combinatory chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and radio&#8208;immunotherapy of 4T1 breast tumor by co&#8208;delivery of chemotherapeutic and radio&#8208;sensitizer, respectively.

         <title>Decoupled MOF Breathing: Pressure&#8208;Induced Reversal of Correlation Between Orthogonal Motions in a Diamondoid Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62 exhibits &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions affecting the cross&#8208;section and length of its 1D pores. Application of pressure reveals that the two motions can be switched between positive correlation and negative correlation, demonstrating decoupling of these motions within the 3D framework and providing a platform for design of more complex dynamic responsive materials.








Abstract
Responsive porous materials can outperform more rigid analogues in applications requiring precise triggering of molecular uptake/release, switching or gradual change in properties. We have uncovered an unprecedented dynamic response in the diamondoid MOF SHF&#8208;62, (Me2NH2)[In(BDC&#8208;NHC(O)Me)2] (BDC&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), by using pressure as a stimulus. SHF&#8208;62 exhibits two distinct framework &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions involving changes in 1) cross&#8208;section and 2) length of its 1D pores. Our study using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in sapphire&#8208;capillary (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.15&#160;GPa) and diamond&#8208;anvil (0.15&#160;&lt;&#160;p &lt; 5&#160;GPa) cells reveals that different pressure regimes trigger positive and negative correlation between these two motions, requiring an unprecedented mechanical decoupling. Specifically, the DMF&#8208;solvated framework SHF&#8208;62&#8208;DMF, in DMF as pressure&#8208;transmitting medium, undergoes initial hyperexpansion of pore cross&#8208;section (p&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa), due to DMF ingress, followed by reversal/reduction at p&#160;&gt;&#160;0.9&#160;GPa while pore length contracts for all pressure increases, revealing decoupling of the two framework deformations. By contrast, nonpenetrating medium FC&#8208;70 imposes correlated compression (p&#160;&lt;&#160;1.4&#160;GPa) of pore cross&#8208;section and length, resembling framework activation/desolvation motions but of greater magnitude. Similar behavior occurs for SHF&#8208;62&#8208;CHCl3 in CHCl3 (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.14&#160;GPa), suggesting minimal ingress of CHCl3. These findings change our understanding of MOF dynamic responses and provide a platform for future responsive materials development.

         <title>Nanochanneling and Local Crystallization Engineering Accelerate Multiphase Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for Rapid Water Decontamination</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystallinity engineering is applied to carbon microspheres for fabricating transition metal single atoms confined in hydrophilic graphitic nanochannels by precisely etching the amorphous carbon realm. This fine&#8208;tuned nanoenvironment enhances tri&#8208;phase mass transfer and optimizes O3 nonradical activation thermodynamics by inducing the bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; O3 adsorption, which reduces O3 activation barrier and accelerates reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Precise engineering of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with optimal hierarchical structures and favorable local chemical environments remains a significant challenge to cater for multiphase heterogeneous processes. Here, we develop a universal strategy for synthesizing channel&#8208;digging microspherical SACs that markedly enhance gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid mass transfer and fine&#8208;tune the thermodynamics of catalytic ozonation. By catalytically graphitizing carbon microspheres and selectively etching amorphous carbon domains via mild combustion, we fabricate cross&#8208;linked hierarchical graphitic nanochannels confining transition metal (e.g., Co, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) single atoms (TMCSs&#8208;Air). This nanoenvironment engineering increases interfacial ozone (O3) mass transfer by 3.2&#8208;fold and directs O3 adsorption from a conventional &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. The enhanced inter&#8208;orbital electronic interactions lower the O3 activation barrier and form highly oxidizing surface&#8208;confined O3 (*O3). Consequently, the CoCSs&#8208;Air catalyst achieves a 3.6&#8208;fold higher ozone utilization efficiency and a 4.2&#8208;fold greater turnover frequency (TOF&#160;=&#160;1580&#160;min&#8722;1) compared with pristine Co&#8208;doped carbon microspheres (CoCSs). Technical and economic evaluations further confirm the feasibility of TMCSs&#8208;Air nanoreactors in treating real&#8208;world petrochemical wastewater, highlighting its broader potential in overcoming gas diffusion barriers and tuning reaction pathways for multiphase heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>An Artificial Metal&#8208;Free Peroxidase Designed Using a Ferritin Cage for Bioinspired Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing artificial enzymes remains challenging due to the need for precise active site control. Here, we present a simple strategy to create metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes by engineering Histidine clusters inside a ferritin cage. The resulting catalyst mimics peroxidase activity, and its stable cage structure offers new insights into supramolecular catalysis, opening avenues for bioinspired catalyst development. 








Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes is challenging because it requires precise design of active sites with well&#8208;arranged amino acid residues. Histidine&#8208;rich oligopeptides have been recently shown to exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities, but their catalytic function relies on maintaining unique supramolecular structures. This work demonstrates the design of a specific array of histidine residues on the internal surface of the ferritin cage to function as an active center for catalysis. The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine&#8211;histidine interactions, forming well&#8208;defined histidine clusters (His&#8208;clusters). These mutants exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities by oxidizing 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co&#8208;localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine&#8208;rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions. This study presents a simple yet effective approach to design metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes, paving the way for innovations in bioinspired catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Designing artificial enzymes remains challenging due to the need for precise active site control. Here, we present a simple strategy to create metal-free artificial enzymes by engineering Histidine clusters inside a ferritin cage. The resulting catalyst mimics peroxidase activity, and its stable cage structure offers new insights into supramolecular catalysis, opening avenues for bioinspired catalyst development.

         <title>Oscillatory Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Pd/TiO2 Under Redox Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oscillatory strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) behavior of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under redox conditions was revealed through environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). The oscillatory TiOx overlayers act as a temporary reservoir for Ti species, facilitating the tip growth of the support protrusion.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis, with its encapsulation configuration being highly dependent on the chemical environments. However, the dynamic behavior of SMSI under redox conditions remains insufficiently understood. Here, environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) revealed that SMSI overlayers form stably on the surface of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under pure O2 and pure H2 conditions, and exhibit oscillatory behavior under a redox condition with a 5:1 O2/H2 ratio at 0.05&#160;Pa. Specifically, the outer layer of the SMSI overlayer, characterized primarily by typical oxidative SMSI, undergoes oscillations between formation and retraction near the Pd&#8208;TiO2 interface. The SMSI oscillations locally modify the morphology of the TiO2 support, with the SMSI overlayer serving as a temporary reservoir for Ti species to drive the tip growth of the support protrusion. Our work expands the understanding of the dynamic behavior of SMSI under reaction conditions and provides new insights into the solid&#8208;state growth mechanism.

         <title>Triple Synergy Engineering via Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Atom Incorporation for Self&#8208;Sustaining Acidic Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a metal&#8208;free heteronuclear catalyst, Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC, engineering atomic&#8208;level triple synergy: 1) Electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;&#8314; and oxygen vacancies boost nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion activity while suppressing H2 evolution. 2) Iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoirs dynamically regulate H* coverage. 3) Covalent Si&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonding stabilizes the interface. The catalyst achieves a 96.8% FE and groundbreaking 420&#8208;h durability in acid. The innovative heteronuclear diatomic synergistic strategy establishes a new design principle for durable, acid&#8208;compatible electrocatalysts of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) for ammonia synthesis under acidic conditions offers significant advantages, like direct fertilizer production and prevention of ammonia volatilization. However, three critical challenges persist: instability of metal&#8208;based catalysts, competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and proton depletion leading to species imbalance. Here, we developed a novel metal&#8208;free heteronuclear diatomic&#8208;based catalyst that simultaneously addresses these challenges through atomic&#8208;level triple synergy engineering. Silicon&#8211;iodine dual&#8208;atoms are precisely anchored on nickel oxide ultrathin nanosheets supported on carbon cloth (Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC) via a gradient&#8208;heating co&#8208;loading method. Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC establishes a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic system, achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE and record&#8208;breaking operational stability of 420&#160;h in acidic electrolyte, surpassing the performance of all reported acid NO3RR electrocatalysts to date. Advanced in situ spectroscopic characterization combined with electrochemical evaluation reveals the triple synergy mechanism: electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;&#8314; and oxygen vacancies generate abundant active sites while mitigating HER competition, iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoirs dynamically regulate H* coverage to maintain species balance, and covalent Si&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding inhibits metal leaching and stabilizes the catalytic system. This work establishes a constructive guideline for the rational engineering of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for selective acidic NO3RR.

         <title>Benzotrifuran&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2 from H2O, O2, and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three benzotrifuran&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks were constructed. The COF&#8208;JLU90 with hydrazone linkage achieves efficient H2O2 photocatalysis with an average mass rate of up to 9800&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from H2O and O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight by balancing O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important green chemical and a potential energy carrier. Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 from only H2O and O2 under sunlight is a fascinating and sustainable tactic. However, deficient proton sources come from the kinetically sluggish H2O oxidation process (&#8764;s) seriously impede half&#8208;reaction of O2 reduction (&#181;s&#8764;ms), leading to inferior photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we prepare a benzotrifuran&#8208;based covalent organic framework featuring electron donor&#8211;acceptor character with hydrazone linkage. Spatially separated donor&#8211;acceptor &#960;&#8208;stacking columns offer rich O2 reduction and H2O oxidation active sites, also serve as channels for photoinduced charge separation and transport. Importantly, the 1D pore containing abundant heteroatoms facilitates H2O delivery to oxidation sites and reduces reaction energy barrier, thus improving the kinetic of H2O oxidation. Accordingly, this porous framework achieves efficient H2O2 photocatalysis with an average mass rate of up to 9800&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from H2O and O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight by balancing O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions.

         <title>Photodriven Aquatic Locomotion in Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Composites with Tunable Wettability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;functionalized MXene integrated into liquid crystal elastomers enables uniform dispersion, enhanced photothermal response, and tunable wettability through superwettable coatings. These properties facilitate light&#8208;induced actuation for advanced soft robotics both at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater.








Abstract
Photodriven liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) composites with thiol&#8208;functionalized Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx MXene nanosheets are introduced as a versatile material system for achieving controlled aquatic locomotion. By incorporating superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic coatings, these composites demonstrate distinct modalities at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of the LCE nanocomposites is enhanced through the homogeneous dispersion of MXene platelets within the LCE matrix, facilitated by thiol&#8208;functionalization. Superhydrophobic coatings increase buoyancy and reduce drag, enabling locomotion akin to water striders at the air&#8211;water interface. Conversely, superhydrophilic coatings submerse the composites to allow photomechanical actuation to drive underwater locomotion against gravity.

&lt;p&gt;Thiol-functionalized MXene integrated into liquid crystal elastomers enables uniform dispersion, enhanced photothermal response, and tunable wettability through superwettable coatings. These properties facilitate light-induced actuation for advanced soft robotics both at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodriven liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) composites with thiol-functionalized Ti&#8323;C&#8322;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; MXene nanosheets are introduced as a versatile material system for achieving controlled aquatic locomotion. By incorporating superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic coatings, these composites demonstrate distinct modalities at the air&#8211;water interface and underwater. The stimuli-responsive behavior of the LCE nanocomposites is enhanced through the homogeneous dispersion of MXene platelets within the LCE matrix, facilitated by thiol-functionalization. Superhydrophobic coatings increase buoyancy and reduce drag, enabling locomotion akin to water striders at the air&#8211;water interface. Conversely, superhydrophilic coatings submerse the composites to allow photomechanical actuation to drive underwater locomotion against gravity. By combining tunable wettability with robust photothermal performance, these MXene-LCE composites open new opportunities for designing and integrating stimuli-responsive materials in aquatic actuation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atomic Hybrid Glasses for Near&#8208;Infrared II Optical Waveguides</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of transparent metal&#8211;organic complex glasses has been synthesized through a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly process that enables facile doping of lanthanide ions. By leveraging the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensitized lanthanide strategy, these glasses exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield and efficient optical waveguiding in the NIR region, thus offering potential advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.








Abstract
The increasing demands for modern information communication and storage necessitate the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active optical waveguides. However, achieving efficient NIR emission with minimal optical loss remains a critical challenge. Herein, we present a new class of rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses, synthesized via bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, as a solution to these limitations. By harnessing the ultralong phosphorescence of Nd3+&#8208;doped complex glasses, these materials achieve NIR&#8208;II emission extending to 1.32&#160;&#181;m with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8764;5.7%, setting a new record among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based complexes in the NIR&#8208;II region. This exceptional performance stems from the efficient sensitization of Nd3+ ions in hybrid glass, with a phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency of 93.55%. Furthermore, these transparent and flexible hybrid glasses trigger optical waveguiding in Eu3+&#8208; and Nd3+&#8208;doped microstructures, enabling ultralow&#8208;loss coefficients of 0.978&#160;dB mm&#8722;1 at 819&#160;nm and 5.1&#160;dB mm&#8722;1 at 1048&#160;nm, respectively. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates that metal&#8211;organic complex glasses with ultralong phosphorescence can effectively serve as sensitizer matrices for boosting NIR&#8208;II emission, but also supports the fabrication of 1D and 2D glassy microstructures with ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguiding for advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.

         <title>Modular Access to Aliphatic Polycarbonates with Tunable Properties and Dual Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability by Polycondensation&#8211;Depolymerization&#8211;Repolymerization Strategy</title>

We presented a &#8220;polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization&#8221; strategy for structurally diverse aliphatic polycarbonates. This involved a step growth polycondensation of dialkyl carbonate and diol to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers which are utilized to produce cyclic carbonates through catalytic depolymerization. The subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate led to high molecular weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) polycarbonates.








Abstract
Great achievements have been made in CO2/epoxide copolymerization and dialkyl carbonate/diol polycondensation; however, efficient preparation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) aliphatic polycarbonates with tunable properties and recyclability under mild conditions still remains as a great challenge. Herein, we presented a &#8220;polycondensation&#8211;depolymerization&#8211;repolymerization&#8221; strategy for structurally diverse aliphatic polycarbonates. This involved a step growth polycondensation of dialkyl carbonate and diol to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (0.5&#8722;1.9&#160;kDa) polycarbonates under atmosphere pressure, which are then utilized to produce cyclic carbonate monomers through catalytic depolymerization. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate led to high molecular weight (&gt;100&#160;kDa) polymers, which can be converted back to cyclic monomer via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization or diol/dialkyl carbonate via alcoholysis, enabling chemical recycling of polycarbonates via dual closed loops. The thermal and mechanical properties of the polycarbonates can be widely adjusted by varying the substituent, and polycarbonate with four&#8208;membered spiro&#8208;cyclic substituent shows a recorded high melting temperature (217&#160;&#176;C) and mechanical strength within the reported polycarbonate family. A(hard)&#8208;B(soft)&#8208;A(hard) triblock thermoplastic elastomers with good mechanical performance and elastic recovery were also created by sequential polymerization. The &#8220;polycondensation&#8722;depolymerization&#8722;repolymerization&#8221; strategy provided a powerful toolbox for developing high&#8208;performance aliphatic polycarbonates.

A biomimetic strategy for simultaneously improving mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healability of elastomers is developed by leveraging F&#9472;H bonds for nanoconfinement to form small and dense nanodomains, resulting in the highest recorded puncture energy and unprecedented fracture energy elastomer thus far.








Abstract
There are often trade&#8208;offs among high mechanical strength, high toughness, and efficient self&#8208;healing. Herein, we present a biomimetic strategy utilizing F&#9472;H bonds for nanoconfinement to achieve the simultaneous enhancement of these conflicting properties. The mechanical strength, toughness, and self&#8208;healing efficiency of a fluorinated crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) (CPUU&#8208;FA) elastomer are improved 1.3&#8208;, 1.5&#8208;, and 1.2&#8208;fold, respectively, compared with those of its nonfluorinated counterpart. Notably, the CPUU&#8208;FA has the highest recorded puncture energy (887 mJ) among polymeric elastomers and the highest fracture energy (117&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) among reported thermoset elastomers. Moreover, it exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency (99%), remarkable reprocessability, and a low surface energy (56&#160;MJ m&#8722;2). The application of self&#8208;healing elastomers in the fabrication of soft electronics is further demonstrated. The molecular design strategy is anticipated to inspire new developments in high&#8208;performance materials for cutting&#8208;edge applications.

         <title>Structural Basis for the Catalytic Mechanism of ATP&#8208;Dependent Diazotase CmaA6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several diazotases have been reported in recent years, but the detailed catalytic mechanism is unclear. From X&#8208;ray crystallography and Cryo&#8208;EM analysis, we obtained the structure of a diazotase CmaA6, which synthesizes 3&#8208;diazocoumaric acid. Kinetic analysis and computational analysis indicated that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via an unprecedented sequential mechanism in which three substrates are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket.








Abstract
Although several diazotases have been recently reported, the details of the reaction mechanism are not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of CmaA6, an ATP&#8208;dependent diazotase, which catalyzes the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid using nitrous acid. X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy&#8208;single particle analysis revealed CmaA6 structures in the substrate&#8208;free and AMP&#8208;binding states. Kinetic analysis suggested that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via a sequential reaction mechanism in which three substrates (nitrous acid, ATP, and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid) are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket. The nitrous acid and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid binding sites were predicted based on the AMP&#8208;binding state and confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. In addition, computational analysis revealed a tunnel for 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid to enter the reaction pocket, which was advantageous for the sequential reaction mechanism. This study provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism of diazotization in natural product biosynthesis.

X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy-single particle analysis revealed CmaA6 structures in the substrate-free and AMP-binding states. Kinetic analysis suggested that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via a sequential reaction mechanism in which three substrates (nitrous acid, ATP, and 3-aminocoumaric acid) are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket. The nitrous acid and 3-aminocoumaric acid binding sites were predicted based on the AMP-binding state and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, computational analysis revealed a tunnel for 3-aminocoumaric acid to enter the reaction pocket, which was advantageous for the sequential reaction mechanism. This study provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism of diazotization in natural product biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous RuOx for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In, which facilitates the switch from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. In contrast, doping with other elements, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, results in negligible improvements in catalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing efficient Ru&#8208;based catalysts is crucial in reducing reliance on costly Ir for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, these Ru&#8208;based catalysts face a fundamental stability challenge due to the highly reactive nature of lattice oxygen. In this work, we propose an effective strategy to stabilize lattice oxygen in 2D amorphous RuOx through p&#8211;p orbital hybridization by incorporating dopants such as Al, Ga, and In. Notably, Ga doping exhibits remarkable acidic OER performance, leading to a 137&#160;mV reduction in overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 125&#8208;fold improvement in stability compared to undoped RuOx. This also surpasses the performances of most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. In contrast, doping with other elements from the same period, such as Mn, Co, or Cu, shows negligible improvements in catalytic performance. In situ electrochemical spectroscopic analysis, couples with theoretical calculations, reveals that the p&#8211;p orbital hybridization in the Ga&#8211;O coordination within Ga&#8211;RuOx effectively reduces the reactivity of lattice oxygen, suppresses the overoxidation of Ru, and switches the reaction pathway from the lattice oxygen mechanism to the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This novel p&#8211;p orbital hybridization strategy holds great potential for the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

         <title>Streamlining SuFEx Inhibitor Development: A Unified Approach Using Photolabile and Orthogonal Sulfinate Protecting Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Study outlines the discovery and selection of sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs) based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions, including two novel, photolabile SPGs that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride (SFs) using light and selectfluor. This streamlined approach to SF synthesis allows for their incorporation at any point in a synthetic endeavor, enabling access to complex SF&#8208;containing small molecules.








Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides (SFs) have gained significant importance due to their classification as a click reaction and therefore have seen increased use in drug discovery and biochemistry. Their use, however, is complicated by the methods by which they are synthesized and their general synthetic instability. This results in SFs being introduced late in a synthetic route with minimal structural diversity. Masking the reactivity of a sulfonyl fluoride by protecting the parent sulfinate is one method to ameliorate these issues. Current sulfinate protecting groups (SPGs), however, possess limited stability. This study outlines the discovery and selection of SPGs based on their overall stability, ease of synthesis, and simple deprotection conditions. This includes the discovery of two novel, photolabile SPGs, para&#8208;methoxybenzyl Rongalite and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl Rongalite that can be directly converted to the sulfonyl fluoride using light and selectfluor. Along with known SPG, 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl sulfone (SES), all three SPGs were found to possess broad stability when exposed to numerous common synthetic conditions and are easily coupled to aryl halides from their sulfinate salt precursor. Their utility is then demonstrated in the synthesis of SPG containing building blocks that are incorporated into several bioactive small molecules.

         <title>Enhancing C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage of Glycerol Electrooxidation Through Spin&#8208;Selective Electron Donation in&#160;Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox Heterostructural Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#8220;spin&#8208;selective electron donation&#8221; strategy effectively modulates the electronic states of Pd's d orbitals (dz2${d_{{z^2}}}$ and dxy) through distinct pathway: &#963;&#8208;donation from low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) and &#960;&#8208;donation from high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1).








Abstract
As a 4d transition metal, the spin state of Pd is extremely difficult to directly regulate for the optimized d orbital states owing to the strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect and further extended d orbital. Herein, we devise a &#8220;spin&#8208;selective electron donation&#8221; strategy to tune specific d orbital electrons of Pd inspired by the Dewar&#8722;Chatt&#8722;Duncanson model theory. Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridges with different spin&#8208;states of CoIII have been constructed in a series of Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox HNSs with tunable Co content. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) with fully occupied t2g orbitals and empty dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ orbitals can accurately alter the dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ electron of Pd by &#963;&#8208;donation via the Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridge. In contrast, the unfilled dxy orbital of high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1) is essential for controlling the dxy electron of Pd via &#960;&#8208;donation. Benefiting from dz2$d_{{z^2}}$ state optimization by &#963;&#8208;donation, Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Co4.0 delivers superior performance toward various bio&#8208;alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol) with enhanced C&#9472;C bond cleavage. Furthermore, coupling the glycerol oxidation reaction with the CO2 reduction reaction (GOR||CO2RR), the electricity consumption of GOR||CO2RR drops 46.4% compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art system (OER||CO2RR). Moreover, anodic Faraday efficiency (FE) of formic acid can be attainable at more than 90% at low voltage regions.

         <title>Enhancing Waste Plastic Hydrogenolysis on Ru/CeO2 Through Concurrent Incorporation of Fe Single Atoms and FeOx Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a high&#8208;performance low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) hydrogenolysis catalyst by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) on Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2. The interaction between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs enhances Ru&#176; content, thereby optimizing C&#9472;C cleavage kinetics, while Fe SAs act as hydrogen storage to regulate surface hydrogen coverage and suppress cascade hydrogenation, ultimately boosting liquid product yield.








Abstract
Ru&#8208;based catalysts have exhibited significant promise in converting waste plastics into valuable long&#8208;carbon chain products. However, their efficiency is hindered by the uncontrollable cascade hydrogenation, which stems from their exceptional reactivity for C&#9472;C cleavage. Herein, we reported a multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeOx nanoclusters (NCs) by Ru NCs&#8208;decorated CeO2 substrates. This catalyst demonstrates an extraordinary performance, achieving nearly 100% low density polyethylene (LDPE) conversion under the conditions of 250 &#176;C and 2&#160;MPa hydrogen after 1 h, along with remarkably&#8208;improved liquid product selectivity of 86.4% compared to that of bare Ru/CeO2 (59.8%). Through a variety of spectroscopic studies, we revealed the unique interactions between FeOx NCs and Ru NCs, which leads to an increased Ru&#176; content. More significantly, we also confirmed the crucial role of Fe SAs in adsorbing active hydrogen species, thereby increasing the hydrogen coverage.

     alt="Enhancing Waste Plastic Hydrogenolysis on Ru/CeO2 Through Concurrent Incorporation of Fe Single Atoms and FeOx Nanoclusters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We construct a high-performance low-density polyethylene (LDPE) hydrogenolysis catalyst by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters (NCs) on Ru NCs-decorated CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The interaction between FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; NCs and Ru NCs enhances Ru&#176; content, thereby optimizing C&#9472;C cleavage kinetics, while Fe SAs act as hydrogen storage to regulate surface hydrogen coverage and suppress cascade hydrogenation, ultimately boosting liquid product yield.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ru-based catalysts have exhibited significant promise in converting waste plastics into valuable long-carbon chain products. However, their efficiency is hindered by the uncontrollable cascade hydrogenation, which stems from their exceptional reactivity for C&#9472;C cleavage. Herein, we reported a multi-scale regulation strategy by selectively anchoring Fe single atoms (SAs) and FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters (NCs) by Ru NCs-decorated CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substrates. This catalyst demonstrates an extraordinary performance, achieving nearly 100% low density polyethylene (LDPE) conversion under the conditions of 250 &#176;C and 2&#160;MPa hydrogen after 1 h, along with remarkably-improved liquid product selectivity of 86.4% compared to that of bare Ru/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (59.8%). Through a variety of spectroscopic studies, we revealed the unique interactions between FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; NCs and Ru NCs, which leads to an increased Ru&#176; content. More significantly, we also confirmed the crucial role of Fe SAs in adsorbing active hydrogen species, thereby increasing the hydrogen coverage. Such precise regulations towards both the intrinsic surface state of Ru and its adjacent chemical environment successfully inhibited the cascade hydrogenation, ultimately resulting in a significant enhancement in the selectivity of liquid products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anchoring Highly Unsaturated Nickel(II) Sites into a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated Ni2+ sites into large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously promoting C2H2 adsorption and selectivity, resulting in the most balance reported so far between C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 (25.7) selectivity at 298&#160;K and 1 bar.








Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) remains a challenge to achieve both high C2H2 uptake and selectivity for a single material. Porous materials with open metal sites (OMSs) have been widely employed to separate various gas mixtures; however, routine OMSs often show the limitation in C2H2/CO2 separation due to the comparable binding affinity with the two gases. Herein, we report a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated nickel(II) sites into a large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously improving C2H2 adsorption and selectivity. The coordination geometry of the anchored Ni2+ ion was accurately determined by SCXRD studies, featuring a two&#8208;coordination model with highly unsaturated OMSs after the activation. This highly unsaturated Ni2+ ion can provide additional binding sites to improve C2H2 adsorption and also enable highly selective binding of C2H2 over CO2 through the specific and strong &#960;&#8208; complexation interactions, as revealed by gas&#8208;loaded SCXRD studies and theoretical simulations. This metalated MOF thus exhibits both significantly enhanced C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 selectivity (25.7) than the pristine NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2 (148.0 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 3.8) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, making an unprecedented balance between C2H2 adsorption and selectivity to overcome the trade&#8208;off challenge. Breakthrough experiments on equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures afford both the top&#8208;tier dynamic selectivity (14.4) and C2H2 productivity of 114.5&#160;L kg&#8722;1 (&gt;99.5% purity) at ambient conditions.

         <title>Restoring Cell&#8211;Cell Communication to Elicit Bystander Effect Using a DNA&#8208;Based Nanocomplex for Robust Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8211;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses, was constructed. It promoted gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer and induced bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, thereby enhancing STING activation and amplifying antitumor immunity. The work provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
The activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has shown promise in enhancing antitumor immunity. However, the pathway involved de novo transcription and translation processes, which delays immune responses. Besides, the rapid clearance of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) by extracellular hydrolase limits its availability, attenuating STING signaling and resulting in insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we constructed a DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8208;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses. By virtue of its capabilities to promote gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer and to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells through bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis, the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in tumor cells was activated and amplified in a transcription&#8208;independent, horizontal manner. The nanocomplex presented safe and robust antitumor effects against not only primary tumors but also distant and metastatic tumors via abscopal effects. The work highlighted the effects of restoring cell&#8211;cell communication on cGAS&#8208;STING activation and provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.

The lithiophilic and lithiophobic groups in hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether diluent can sustain rapid Li&#8314; transport and anion&#8211;cation aggregates enrichment in LHCEs. The accelerated Li&#8314; transport, desolvation kinetics, and the formed robust SEI endow Li||LiFePO4 cell with the capacity retention of 92.2% after 150 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 91.3% after 60 cycles at 65&#160;&#176;C. The Li||NCM811 pouch cell delivers the capacity retention of 91.6% after 75 cycles.








Abstract
Conventional electrolytes in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) suffer from irreversible interfacial degradation at elevated temperatures and sluggish Li&#8314; desolvation/transport kinetics under cryogenic conditions. Herein, we present an innovative semi&#8208;solvated hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME) diluent in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) that strategically addresses these limitations. Li&#8314; hopping networks within the electrolyte can be preserved even at low temperatures due to the coordination of lithiophilic groups in HFME molecules with Li&#8314;. Simultaneously, lithiophobic group induced spatial confinement effects promote the formation of anion&#8211;cation aggregates (AGGs), significantly optimizing Li&#8314; desolvation kinetics and boosting the formation of inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with exceptional thermal stability. Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) cell with the diluent&#8208;coordinated LHCEs (DCL) can deliver 125.4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 initial capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with 92.2% retention after 150 cycles. Under elevated temperatures (65&#160;&#176;C), the DCL&#8208;based Li||LFP cell can maintain the capacity retention of 91.3% over 60 cycles. The Li||NCM811 pouch cell (10&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;6.5&#160;cm, capacity: 1000&#160;mA&#160;h) based on the DCL exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 91.6% of its initial capacity after 75 cycles. This work pioneers a solvent chemistry paradigm through spatially modulated solvation structures, establishing fundamental design principles for electrolyte for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range LMBs.

Mechanosynthesis of polyZIF overcomes MOF&#8208;polymer phase incompatibility via in&#8208;situ polymer&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Im coordination networks. Pore architecture engineering yielded molecular&#8208;sieving membrane transport channels that enhanced butadiene permeance to 332 GPU while maintaining outstanding selectivities against C4 hydrocarbons through the size&#8208;exclusion mechanisms. Scalable manufacturing of polyZIF membranes (&#8764;80 cm2) was realized.








Abstract
The integration of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with polymers for efficient C4 hydrocarbon separation membranes remains challenging, primarily due to inherent phase incompatibility. This work presents an in&#8208;situ synthesis strategy for polymer&#8208;zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (polyZIF), utilizing polymer&#8208;metal&#8208;ligand coordination bonds combined with structural directing agents to produce crystalline microporous frameworks. With an accessible BET surface area of 261 m2 g&#8722;1 and a permanent porosity of ca. 4.42&#160;&#197;, polyZIF membrane demonstrates butadiene permeance (&#8764;332 GPU) and the selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butene, and iso&#8208;butane (17.2, 28.1, 21.5, and 34.8) under mixed gas conditions, respectively. Demonstrating practical scalability, the improved dispersibility and reduced interfacial defects in polyZIF facilitates fabrication of large&#8208;area defect&#8208;free membranes (up to 80 cm2) while maintaining robust C4 separation performance. This advancement not only establishes a novel preparation for constructing polyZIF membranes with C4 hydrocarbon molecular&#8208;sieving capability but also provides critical insights into industrial application of ZIF&#8208;based polymer membranes.

The TOC graphic illustrates the dual&#8208;antenna ligand strategy in Ln&#8208;MOF scintillators, enhancing X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. It highlights energy transfer mechanisms leading to Eu3+ emission. The Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen scintillator achieves high relative light yield and water stability, enabling underwater and dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF) scintillators are promising for X&#8208;ray imaging owing to their structural tunability and high X&#8208;ray attenuation. However, achieving efficient triplet&#8208;sensitized scintillation remains challenging due to the inefficient energy transfer between organic ligand triplets and lanthanide centers, leading to weak radioluminescence and limited imaging resolution. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;antenna ligand strategy by synergizing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybis (benzoic acid) (Oba) and phenanthroline derivatives (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#160;=&#160;Phen; or Bathophenanthroline&#160;=&#160;Bphen) with Eu3+ ions, constructing ultrabright Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen and Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen scintillators. Notably, Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen demonstrated a record relative light yield of 60331&#160;&#177;&#160;&#160;28 photons MeV&#8722;1, outperforming Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Phen by 71%. This superior scintillation performance originates from an 86.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19% photoluminescence quantum yield, attributed to enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer efficiency and the suppression of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking among organic chromophore ligands. Besides, the fabrication of flexible Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Bphen films achieves a spatial resolution of 37.0&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 in static imaging and enables real&#8208;time dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging at 60 fps (2&#160;K). Additionally, it exhibited exceptional water stability, with negligible performance degradation in water for over 100 days, allowing clear underwater visualization of circuit boards under X&#8208;ray irradiation. It provides a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance water&#8208;stable scintillators via ligand engineering.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Poly(adipate)Esters via Catalytic Isomerizing Dual Hydroesterificative Polymerization of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>

One&#8208;step production of aliphatic polyesters: An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy was developed for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the IDHP exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyesters.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(adipate)esters, are attracting substantial attention as sustainable materials due to their degradability, recyclability, and versatility in various applications. However, the conventional production of poly(adipate)esters relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes and petroleum&#8208;derived adipic acid (AA), whose synthesis poses environmental concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions. Herein, we introduce a novel Pd&#8208;catalyzed isomerizing dual hydroesterificative polymerization (IDHP) strategy for direct poly(adipate)ester synthesis from readily available feedstocks of 1,3&#8208;butadiene, diols, and carbon monoxide. Key to success lay in the utilization of an electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligand with bulky steric hindrance, which efficiently facilitated linear&#8208;selective isomerizing hydroesterification. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the isomerizing hydroesterificative polymerization exhibited remarkable efficiency in producing poly(adipate)esters. The resulting poly(adipate)esters possess a similar structure compared to those produced by traditional polycondensation. With abundant feedstocks and atom&#8208;economy, this methodology provides a practical and eco&#8208;friendly approach to the production of poly(adipate)esters with varied microstructures.

This study presents a platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films using polymer brushes and electron&#8208;beam lithography. By mitigating aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and enabling dynamic optical modulation, these reprogrammable surfaces offer scalable integration into microchip technologies, biosensing platforms, and diagnostic systems.








Abstract
We present a versatile platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films by harnessing the structural versatility of polymer brushes in combination with electron&#8208;beam lithography (EBL). This approach enables the precise spatial organization of carbon dots (CDs) at the nanoscale, facilitating dynamic modulation of their photoluminescent properties in response to environmental stimuli. Three model systems were examined, incorporating pH&#8208; and thermally responsive polymers, functionalized through covalent and dynamic covalent bonding strategies. By leveraging the spatial control afforded by nanostructured polymer brushes, we achieved precise tuning of optical properties while mitigating aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, a longstanding challenge in solid&#8208;state CD applications. In addition to the advances in controlling optical properties, this work highlights the potential of polymer brush systems to function as optically active, reprogrammable surfaces. The resulting nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials exhibit highly responsive, reconfigurable photonic behavior, offering a scalable pathway for integrating advanced optical interfaces into microchip technologies, biosensing platforms, and multiplexed diagnostic systems. The fusion of polymer brushes, carbon dots, and advanced lithographic techniques marks a substantial advancement in the development of functional materials with nanoscale precision and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

This study develops DHTPA, a NIR fluorescent, pH&#8208;responsive AIE photosensitizer that enhances photodynamic therapy for bacterial infections by promoting ROS generation in acidic environments, demonstrating effective antibacterial activity and accelerated wound healing in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Bacterial infections significantly alter the local microenvironment, with acidic byproducts from bacterial metabolism leading to a pronounced pH reduction. Leveraging this characteristic, we synthesized and identified DHTPA, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent and pH&#8208;responsive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer, for enhanced photodynamic therapy against bacterial infections. DHTPA aggregates exhibit a 2.1&#8208;fold increase in ROS generation under weakly acidic conditions (pH 5.5) compared to neutral conditions (pH 7.4), attributed to its pH&#8208;dependent electronic structure modulation. Upon NIR light irradiation, DHTPA aggregates precisely respond to the acidic microenvironment, significantly boosting ROS production for efficient bacterial eradication. In vitro studies demonstrated that DHTPA achieved over 99.9% bactericidal efficiency against both gram&#8208;negative and gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In a murine infected wound model, DHTPA treatment accelerated wound healing by 2.4 times, markedly reduced bacterial burden, and alleviated inflammatory responses, highlighting its therapeutic potential. By integrating NIR activation, pH responsiveness, and AIE properties, DHTPA presents a precise and efficient antibacterial therapeutic strategy, offering an innovative solution for the clinical management of bacterial infections.

         <title>Boosting Electronic Charge Transport in Conductive Hydrogels via Rapid Ion&#8208;Electron Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel featuring a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous network is constructed from entangled PSS chains and PEDOT:PSS polycrystals. The dense PSS assemblies with ultrahigh ionic concentrations lower the electron hopping barrier between PEDOT microcrystals under an electric field&#8211;induced local polarization, thereby enhancing electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels becomes predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of conventional electronic conductors.








Abstract
Traditional design of conductive hydrogels involves embedding conductive components within a hydrated polymeric network to establish interconnected electron pathways. While the hydration shell of the polymeric network is typically considered insulating, we demonstrate that it can enhance electron transport. Using a PEDOT:PSS hydrogel, we propose a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous topological structure, consisting of entangled PSS chains, dense PSS assemblies, and PEDOT microcrystals. In the hydrated state, the dense PSS assemblies significantly lower the energy barrier for electron hopping between PEDOT microcrystals, thereby promoting electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels is predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of electronic conductors. The charge transport rate reaches up to 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1, which is approximately five orders of magnitude higher than that of ion&#8208;based processes. This characteristic imparts the hydrogels with kinetically sensitive ion&#8208;electron transduction, enabling time&#8208;resolved electrochemical analysis of biochemical processes.

         <title>Understanding the Position Effects of Monoatom Doping in Silver Nanoclusters on Oxygen Reduction by Single Entity Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the oxygen reduction behaviors of single monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu) nanoclusters. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with the intracluster migration of the Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 nanoclusters.








Abstract
Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) with monoatom doping represents an effective strategy to enhance catalytic performances due to the synergistic interactions between the dopant and host atoms. However, in&#8208;depth understanding the position effects of monoatom doping within alloying NCs, particularly at the atomic level, remains elusive. Here, we employed single entity collision electrochemistry method to investigate the electrocatalytic behaviors of individual monoatom&#8208;doped bimetallic M1Ag24 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu) NCs toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By relying on high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput electrochemical measurements, we successfully discriminated the effects of monoatom variation in M1Ag24 NCs on ORR activity at the single atom resolution and identified different M1Ag24 NCs across characteristic populations. Our experimental findings and theoretical calculations reveal the electrocatalytic reaction dynamics associated with intracluster migration of Au monoatom during the dynamic alloying process of Au1Ag24 NCs. This work demonstrates a novel approach for in situ identifying the position effects of foreign doping atoms on the electrocatalytic activity of alloy NCs at the single atom level.

         <title>Nonbonding Electron Inversion&#8208;Driven Structural Engineering: Synergistic Enhancement of Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a nonbonding electron&#8208;inversion strategy, the introduction of supertetrahedral units mitigates the weak optical anisotropy caused by the aggregation of nonbonding electrons at pseudo&#8208;vacancies, achieving simultaneous regulation of both linear and nonlinear optical properties. This transformation led to a 219% and 125% enhancement in &#916;n and SHG response.








Abstract
The simultaneous optimization of large birefringence (&#916;n, a linear optical property) and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG, a nonlinear optical (NLO) property) in a single crystal remains a significant challenge due to the inherently distinct structural requirements for these properties. Although nonbonding electrons have been extensively studied in oxides and chalcogenides, research has predominantly focused on their role along polar axes, leaving their influence along 4&#175;$\bar 4$ axes in tetrahedral stacking largely unexplored. Herein, we propose a nonbonding electron&#8208;inversion strategy to overcome phase&#8208;matching limitations in defect diamond&#8208;like structures. By incorporating T2&#8208;[Ga4S10] supertetrahedral motifs, we successfully synthesized [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] (space group: I4&#175;$\bar 4$), which exhibits a 219% enhancement in &#916;n compared to the nonphase&#8208;matching parent structure Cd2GaS4. The weakly bound nonbonding electrons, governed by atomic potentials, demonstrate strong SHG responses under optical fields. The compound [Ba4Cl2][CdGa4S10] not only achieves a broad transmission range (0.28&#8211;18.6&#160;&#181;m) and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (40.1&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2) but also optimally balances a wide bandgap (Eg&#160;=&#160;3.58&#160;eV) and a large SHG response (1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2), representing one of the best&#8208;performing Cd&#8208;based materials to date. This work introduces the first phase&#8208;matching design strategy based on nonbonding electron&#8208;driven structure&#8211;property relationships, providing critical insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Interface Engineered Electrolyte Design Strategy for Ultralong&#8208;Cycle Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries Over Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoropolymer&#8208;containing plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based electrolyte (FPCE) has been fabricated on the basis of the in situ SEI design strategy. The rationally designed polymer network has been shown to optimize the Li+ transport behavior, promote the in situ formation of LiF&#8208;rich inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid SEI and significantly improve the interfacial stability of the lithium anode, thus enabling solid&#8208;state lithium batteries for stable operation from &#8722;10 to 80 &#176;C.








Abstract
Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is the direction of development for the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the suboptimal ionic conductive properties exhibited by the electrolyte, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites due to the deposition of inhomogeneous Li+ and the potential safety hazards caused by unstable interfaces have seriously affected the cycle life of the battery at extreme temperatures. Herein, a fluoropolymer&#8208;containing plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based electrolyte (FPCE) has been developed by means of a structural engineering process, with the objective of optimizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI).

     alt="Interface Engineered Electrolyte Design Strategy for Ultralong-Cycle Solid-State Lithium Batteries Over Wide Temperature Range"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fluoropolymer-containing plastic-crystal-based electrolyte (FPCE) has been fabricated on the basis of the in situ SEI design strategy. The rationally designed polymer network has been shown to optimize the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport behavior, promote the in situ formation of LiF-rich inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid SEI and significantly improve the interfacial stability of the lithium anode, thus enabling solid-state lithium batteries for stable operation from &#8722;10 to 80 &#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is the direction of development for the practical application of solid-state lithium batteries. However, the suboptimal ionic conductive properties exhibited by the electrolyte, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites due to the deposition of inhomogeneous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the potential safety hazards caused by unstable interfaces have seriously affected the cycle life of the battery at extreme temperatures. Herein, a fluoropolymer-containing plastic-crystal-based electrolyte (FPCE) has been developed by means of a structural engineering process, with the objective of optimizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The integration of solvent structure simulation and experimental results demonstrates that FPCE regulates Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, promotes the in-situ formation of the LiF-rich inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid SEI, and enhances the overall stability of the battery. Consequently, FPCE assists in preserving stable LFP|FPCE|Li cells cycling, with 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 C and an average capacity decay rate of merely 0.00448% per cycle. Furthermore, the Ah-level pouch cells demonstrate the capacity to operate stably within the temperature range of &#8722;10 to 80 &#176;C. This study provides a valuable strategy for the design of wide-temperature solid-state polymer electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Restricting Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Secondary Coordinated Sulfur Enabling Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal sulfur&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to enhance the direct 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and suppress the competing 2e&#8722; pathways in various carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including Co&#9472;N@C, Ni&#9472;N@C, Mn&#9472;N@C, and N@C. The optimized Co&#9472;N/Co@C&#8208;S Zn&#8208;air battery exhibits impressive power density and rate performance, as well as a remarkable lifespan of 2500&#160;h with minimal charge/discharge voltage fluctuations.








Abstract
The direct four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (4e&#8722; ORR) critically governs efficiency and lifespan in metal&#8211;air batteries and fuel cells, yet selectively suppressing competitive 2e&#8722; and stepwise 2e&#8722;pathways that generate corrosive hydrogen peroxide remains a major challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the strategic incorporation of secondary coordinated sulfur atoms into transition metal&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts to effectively promote direct 4e&#8722; ORR and simultaneously suppress undesirable 2e&#8722; pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando spectroscopy reveal that enhanced adsorption of key intermediate *OOH facilitates efficient O&#9472;O bond cleavage, underpinning altered catalytic selectivity. Importantly, this approach is universally applicable to various carbon&#8208;based catalysts, including Co&#9472;N@C, Ni&#9472;N@C, Mn&#9472;N@C, and N@C. Specifically, a sulfur&#8208;mediated Co&#9472;N/Co@C catalyst, comprising Co&#9472;N4 sites and Co nanoparticles, dramatically lowers the 2e&#8722; O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 rate constant to merely 0.05&#8208;fold of its original value at 0.78&#160;V. Consequently, Zn&#8208;air batteries using Co&#9472;N/Co@C&#8208;S as cathode exhibits an outstanding peak power density of 220&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, remarkable lifespan over 2500&#160;h, and outstanding rate performance from 5 to 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work paves a generalizable route for designing highly active and selective electrocatalysts suitable for advanced long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Assembled From {Ni6} Nodes for Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;organic cages including MOC&#8208;18N, MOC&#8208;24N, and MOC&#8208;36N utilizing the novel hexa&#8208;nuclear {Ni6} unit as three or four connected nodes were successfully isolated, displaying superior photocatalytic activity and selectivity in converting CO2 into CO.








Abstract
Constructing cluster&#8208;based nodes and using them as catalytic sites can bring new structure and function for metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). However, successful examples are very limited. Herein, we found that a 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (Hmmt) based {Ni6} subunit is robust in building such MOCs. The {Ni6} node is based on the central Ni4 cubane and two wing Ni(II) ions with virtually three or four connected features. When various carboxylate ligands are incorporated the triangular prismatic [Ni18(Hmmt)3(mmt)12(BPDC)6(CH3O)12(H2O)6(DMF)6] (4/MOC&#8208;18N, H2BPDC&#160;=&#160;biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid), tetrahedral&#8208;like [Ni24(Hmmt)4(mmt)16(BTC)4(CH3O)16Cl4(H2O)4(DMF)5(CH3OH)3] (5/MOC&#8208;24N, H3BTC&#160;=&#160;1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid) and the octahedral [Ni36(Hmmt)6(mmt)24(BTC)8(CH3O)24(H2O)12(DMF)12] (6/MOC&#8208;36N) can be isolated. Interestingly, MOCs 4&#8211;6 can uptake CO2 in solid states. Moreover, they can effectively and selectively convert CO2 into CO under visible light owing to the active wing Ni(II) ions, which are ancillarily coordinated with solvent molecules. All of them show turnover frequencies larger than 3500&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity higher than 90%. This is a much higher performance compared to the usage of cage space for CO2 reduction in previously reported MOCs and competitive to most Ni(II)&#8208;based simple coordination complexes. As such, this work may open a new paradigm for designing node based catalytic function for MOCs.

         <title>Synthesis of Nitriles from Dinitrogen via N&#8208;Atom Transfer on Rhenium Nitride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the reduction of rhenium trichloride or oxo dichloride bearing a rigid acriPNP ligand under an atmosphere of N2, we facilely prepared a terminal rhenium nitride [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl]. Upon reaction with RC(O)X (X&#160;=&#160;OTf, Cl), the nitride directly afforded a wide array of nitriles. Remarkably, these nitrile&#8208;forming protocols concomitantly regenerate the nitride precursors, efficiently completing a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated dinitrogen (N2) splitting into terminal nitrido moiety followed by N&#8208;atom transfer is an attractive strategy for N2 fixation beyond ammonia. While the functionalization of N2&#8208;derived nitride complexes have been widely investigated, their N&#8208;atom transfer reactions to provide N&#8208;containing organic compounds were rarely reported. Herein, we report the synthesis of a rhenium nitride complex [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl] (acriPNP&#160;=&#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)&#8208;2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;acridin&#8208;10&#8208;ide) via reductive N2 cleavage from either rhenium trichloride or rhenium oxo dichloride complexes. The rhenium nitride exhibits N&#8208;atom transfer reactivity with acyl triflates or chlorides under mild conditions, affording nitriles concomitant with the regeneration of the nitride precursors, rhenium oxo or trichloride complexes, respectively. This overall N&#8208;atom transfer from N2 to acyl electrophiles produced a series of alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic nitriles, in moderate to good yields, offering a versatile and practical strategy for accessing 15N&#8208;labeled nitriles. This work established a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle, offering valuable insights into transformations of N2 into nitrogenous products.

The rhenium nitride exhibits N-atom transfer reactivity with acyl triflates or chlorides under mild conditions, affording nitriles concomitant with the regeneration of the nitride precursors, rhenium oxo or trichloride complexes, respectively. This overall N-atom transfer from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to acyl electrophiles produced a series of alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic nitriles, in moderate to good yields, offering a versatile and practical strategy for accessing &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled nitriles. This work established a two-step synthetic cycle, offering valuable insights into transformations of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into nitrogenous products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands with a Terminal Olefin Enables Asymmetric Orthogonal Auto&#8208;Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an innovative catalytic strategy, orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC), which seamlessly integrates transition&#8208;metal catalysis with organocatalysis in a single reactor. By rationally designing novel chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos), we have accomplished the first one&#8208;pot asymmetric OATC involving four distinct catalytic cycles, achieving excellent yield and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (ATC) leverages the multiple roles of the catalyst, facilitating the direct synthesis of complex molecules from simple starting materials in a highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner. However, in conventional ATC, employing a single catalyst imposes significant limitations on the variety of catalyzed reactions. Herein, we present a novel catalysis strategy termed &#8220;orthogonal auto&#8208;tandem catalysis (OATC)&#8221;, which provides the unique opportunity to develop more efficient chemical transformations that cannot be achieved with existing catalytic modes. An unprecedented tandem annulation process involving four different catalytic cycles via asymmetric OATC is demonstrated. The enantio&#8208;determining step is a previously unrealized Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic lactonization. The key to the whole success lies in the development of a new class of chiral bisphosphine ligands with a terminal olefin (TOPhos) that addressed not only the racemization issue of allylic ester products in classic &#960;&#8208;allylmetal chemistry, but also the inherent compatibility challenges in transition&#8208;metal/organo dual catalytic system. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the vital role of the terminal olefin in TOPhos, enabling the differentiation of competitive enantioselective pathways.

         <title>Control over S(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Center: NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Cyclic Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs) via desymmetrization of prochiral SIA anions is presented. The in situ generated acylazolium from easily available aldehydes using NHC was intercepted with SIA anions to deliver configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies, including DFT, provide insight into the possible reaction pathway, and functionalization of the SIAs are also provided.








Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of aza&#8208;sulfur(VI) compounds holds significant potential in pharmaceuticals owing to their broad spectrum of biological properties. Herein, we report the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs). The free N&#8211;H containing SIAs often exhibit configurational lability through tautomerization. We investigated this by demonstrating their nonsymmetric nature in both solid state and solution. The in situ generated chiral acylazolium intermediates from easily accessible aldehydes in the presence of NHC and oxidant were trapped with the prochiral cyclic SIA anions, allowing the enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies reveal that the present strategy proceeds via the desymmetrization of the prochiral SIA anions. Moreover, the derivatization of the synthesized N&#8208;acyl SIAs highlights the practical utility of the present methodology.

         <title>Topological Control Over Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Elucidating Electron Transfer Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrinic 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with distinct sql and bex topologies but identical chemical compositions were constructed to probe topology&#8208;dependent electron transfer. Systematic characterization demonstrated that bex&#8208;COFs exhibit enhanced electron transfer kinetics and modified band structures compared to their sql analogues, revealing topology&#8208;directed electron regulation.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising functional materials due to their programmable architectures and tunable functionalities. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of porphyrin&#8208;based 2D COFs remains restricted by the prevalent use of sql topology, hindering comprehensive structure&#8208;property exploration. Herein, we systematically designed and synthesized porphyrinic 2D COFs featuring distinct sql and bex topological configurations. Comprehensive structural characterization confirmed precise control over lattice geometries, revealing monoporous structure in sql topology versus biporous architecture in bex topology. Electrochemical investigations uncovered topology&#8208;governed electron transport characteristics, with the unique coordination geometry of bex topology exhibiting enhanced electron transfer efficiency. Band structure analysis demonstrated that topological configuration and chemical composition collectively modulate electronic structures. Inspired by these findings, we developed nickel&#8208;incorporated bex&#8208;COFs for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. The optimized Ni&#8208;BBFPP&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF with bex topology demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, achieving a low overpotential of 342&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which surpasses most reported porphyrin&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This study not only significantly expands the structural repertoire of porphyrinic COFs but also establishes explicit correlations between topological engineering and electrocatalytic performance, providing fundamental design principles for advanced energy conversion materials.

         <title>AI.zymes: A Modular Platform for Evolutionary Enzyme Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite significant progress in protein design, enzyme catalysis remains a major challenge. Here, we present AI.zymes, a computational platform for evolutionary enzyme design. Through iterative rounds of design and screening, AI.zymes integrates cutting&#8208;edge bioengineering tools (ProteinMPNN, Rosetta, ESMFold, FieldTools, etc.) into a modular pipeline. AI.zymes was experimentally benchmarked by enhancing the catalytic activity of a model enzyme 7.7&#8208;fold.








Abstract
The ability to create new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes would substantially advance bioengineering, medicine, and the chemical industry. Despite recent breakthroughs in protein design and structure prediction, designing novel biocatalysts remains challenging. Here, we present AI.zymes, a modular platform integrating cutting&#8208;edge protein engineering algorithms within an evolutionary framework (https://github.com/bunzela/AIzymes). By combining bioengineering tools such as Rosetta, ESMFold, ProteinMPNN, and FieldTools in iterative rounds of design and selection, AI.zymes can optimize a broad range of catalytically relevant properties. In addition to enhancing transition state affinity and protein stability, AI.zymes can also improve properties that are not targeted by the employed design algorithms. For instance, AI.zymes can enhance electrostatic catalysis by iteratively selecting variants with stronger catalytic electric fields. Benchmarking AI.zymes on the promiscuous Kemp eliminase activity of ketosteroid isomerase led to a 7.7&#8208;fold activity increase after experimentally testing just 7 variants. Due to its modularity, AI.zymes can readily incorporate emerging design algorithms, paving the way for a unifying framework for enzyme design.

         <title>Interfacial Atom Rearrangement Drives Potential&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>

This work reports a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY, establishing a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, generating high&#8208;density active sites, and realizing excellent olefin hydrogenation performances in aqueous media.








Abstract
Dynamic rearrangement of metal atoms at heterointerfaces by chemical bond conversion drives high efficiency electrocatalytic processes, which is a new concept in the field of electrocatalysis and a new discovery to directly improve catalytic activity. It is of great significance to explore transformative catalytic systems that directly control the interfacial structure and function of atomic composition. As an emerging 2D carbon allotrope featuring unique sp&#8208;sp2 co&#8208;hybridization, graphdiyne (GDY) offers unprecedented advantages for heterointerface engineering. In particular, the uneven surface charge distribution of GDY, high distribution of active sites and customizable electronic structures provide unprecedented opportunities for the development of a new generation of catalytic systems. Here, we report a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY. The results of atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy characterization revealed two unique interfacial phenomena: i) GDY&#8208;induced massive dislocation formation within NiPd nanoalloys and ii) rearrangement of surface metal atoms from (111) to (200) facets. Detailed spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated the composition&#8208;dependent evolution of elemental valence states and stoichiometric ratios. This atomic&#8208;level restructuring establishes a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, which improves the overall conductivity and intrinsic activity. What is even more encouraging is that this electrocatalytic olefin hydrogenation is carried out in an aqueous solution. The GDY/NiPd/GDY heterostructure achieves exceptional activity (turnover frequency: 6.8&#160;s&#8722;1), stability (&gt;5 cycles), and chemo&#8208;selectivity (&#8722;100%), which is superior to traditional catalysts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enable Spontaneous Singlet Oxygen Generation Without Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized and characterized, which are capable of spontaneously generating singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) by directly activating atmospheric triplet oxygen (3O&#8322;) without requiring light irradiation. The highly selective production of &#185;O&#8322; by these MOFs was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and probe experiments. These materials demonstrate promising applications in aerobic sulfide oxidation and antibacterial systems, leveraging their ability to efficiently generate reactive oxygen species under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a widely used reactive oxygen species (ROS), making the development of new materials capable of efficiently generating it highly important. In this work, we report a series of isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), named JNU&#8208;300 (JNU&#160;=&#160;Jinan University), can spontaneously generate 1O2 by directly activating triplet oxygen (3O2) from the air without the need for additional light irradiation. The highly selective generation of 1O2 by JNU&#8208;300 is verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and probe experiments for 1O2. The generated 1O2 can be employed for aerobic oxidation of sulfide and antibacterial application. Mechanism studies revealed that the framework structure, and the adsorption and polarization of O2 by the coordination units of JNU&#8208;300, are crucial for the 1O2 generation. To the best of our knowledge, MOFs JNU&#8208;300 are the first MOF material capable of producing 1O2 by activating 3O2 in the absence of light at room temperature. This work provides new insights into the design and construction of functional MOF materials capable of generating 1O2 via activating 3O2 without light irradiation, opening new possibilities for their application in specialized fields that require 1O2 in the dark.

         <title>Electrochemically Promoted Activation of Light Alkanes at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs two Cu electrodes in the presence of oxygen gas to selectively convert ethane and propane into alkenes and oxygenates under ambient conditions, achieving excellent stability by periodically reversing the current direction. Our approach attains a combined selectivity for ethylene and acetic acid exceeding 96% and achieves acetic acid concentrations as high as 19&#160;mM during prolonged operation, establishing a new performance benchmark for the electrochemical activation of light alkanes.








Abstract
The electrochemical activation of light alkanes into value&#8208;added products represents a promising pathway for sustainable chemical synthesis and the storage of renewable energy. In this study, we introduce an electrochemically promoted system that employs copper plates as electrode and oxygen as oxidant, capable of converting ethane into ethylene and acetic acid with production rates of 6.9 and 6.2&#160;&#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, with a combined selectivity exceeding 92%, under ambient conditions. Additionally, this system can convert propane to propylene at a rate of 11.6&#160;&#181;mol&#183;cm&#8722;2Cu&#183;h&#8722;1, with selectivity reaching up to 86%. A 10&#160;h run with ethane demonstrates consistent production of ethylene and acetic acid, with a sustained selectivity above 96%, and achieves an acetic acid concentration of 19&#160;mM. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals the active surface and a critical reaction intermediate. Combining with partial pressure dependence study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a potential reaction mechanism involving the competitive adsorption of oxygen and alkane producing an alkyl group as a key reaction step in the reaction process.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Doped Cobalt Molybdate Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence Imaging for Dynamic Multilevel Information Encryption System Construction and Biomarker Sensing Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exhibiting different efficiencies in converting tripropylamine into free radicals, iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate and cobalt molybdate generate a signal gradient in the ECL image that enhances information multidimensionality. Leveraging this feature, these materials serve as chemical inks for encrypted printing, thereby establishing a multilevel information encryption strategy for information security.








Abstract
Integrating electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging with a multilevel information encryption strategy overcomes the limitations of conventional encryption methods, which rely solely on abstract electrical signals, by providing intuitive visual outputs. Herein, a dynamic multilevel information encryption system based on ECL imaging was successfully constructed, which realizes robust protection and precisely controlled decryption of information through the multidimensional security mechanism of &#8220;biometrics (biospecific recognition of the primary key) &#8211; electrochemical activation (precise voltage&#8208;triggered activation of the secondary key) &#8211; operational sequence dependence (strict matching of the operational timing)&#8211;signal gradient (decryptor judgment)&#8221;. Specifically, we develop a functional chemical ink comprised of iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate and biomolecules, which is applied onto nitrocellulose membranes via micro&#8208;patterned printing to construct biocompatible, environmentally responsive encryption interfaces. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate that iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate accelerates the conversion of tripropylamine (TPrA) into TPrA radicals, forming a signal gradient with the cobalt molybdate catalytic region and thereby further enhancing the dimensionality of information encryption. Furthermore, a chemical ink&#8208;based ECL sensor was developed for ultra&#8208;sensitive detection of the cancer biomarker CA15&#8208;3, demonstrating the dual potential application in biomedical information security and disease diagnosis.

Oxidation of Mn&#8322;(CO)&#8321;&#8320; under pseudo gas&#8208;phase conditions generates the weakly coordinated 16 valence electron complex [Mn(CO)&#8325;]&#8314;, which binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest ligand available in this system. Three isomers were characterized by low&#8208;temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers is a new route to generate reactive metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8211;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes are key intermediates in C&#8211;H activation and, until now, analysis of these species has been restricted to either the solution OR the solid state. Here we present a synthetic methodology that converts Mn2(CO)10 in a noncoordinating solvent environment to [Mn(CO)5]+ at room temperature, and this species binds n&#8208;pentane as the strongest interacting ligand available. Three isomers of the n&#8208;pentane &#963;&#8208;complexes were studied in detail by solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy at low temperature. Two isomers of [Mn(CO)5(n&#8208;pentane)]+ crystallize from solution at room temperature and their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The oxidation of metal complex dimers in solution to generate reactive metal cations, which bind alkanes as the strongest available ligand, is a new and probably general approach to generate metal&#8208;alkane &#963;&#8208;complexes.

         <title>Facile N&#9552;N Bond Cleavage of Cis&#8208;Azobenzene with Bis&#8208;silylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpectedly easy N&#9552;N bond scission of cis&#8208;azobenzene using two bis&#8208;silylenes with different spacers and distinct SiII&#183;&#183;&#183;SiII distances is reported. While both bis&#8208;silylenes enable C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#8208;bond activation of trans&#8208;azobenzene, the cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated activation of cis&#8208;azobenzene leads to bis&#8208;silamines (Si&#9552;N) and related novel products. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the mechanism and nature of the intermediates of the N&#9552;N cleavage products.








Abstract
The very different features of cooperative disilicon(II)&#8208;mediated N&#9552;N bond activation of trans&#8208; vs. cis&#8208;azobenzene are reported, employing two bis&#8208;silylenes with distinct intramolecular Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si distances, PhN(LSi:)&#8322; 1 (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(tBuN)&#8322;, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 2.9&#160;&#197;) and XT(LSi:)&#8322; 2 (XT&#160;=&#160;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl, Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si: 4.3&#160;&#197;). While trans&#8208;azobenzene reacts with both bis&#8208;silylenes to form C&#9472;H and N&#9552;N &#960;&#160;bond activation products, the cis&#8208;isomer undergoes only N&#9552;N bond scission. Thus, the reaction of 1 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at room temperature affords the unprecedented N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 4, featuring a bis&#8208;silaimine with terminal and bridging Si&#9552;N moieties. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with cis&#8208;azobenzene at &#8211;30 &#176;C in THF allows for the isolation of the [1+2] cycloaddition intermediate 6, containing a three&#8208;membered SiN&#8322; ring (siladiazirane), which rearranges to the N&#9552;N bond cleavage product 8 at room temperature. Compound 6 reacts with one additional equivalent of cis&#8208;azobenzene to form bis&#8208;silaazirane 7 with two SiN&#8322; rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support stepwise Si(II)&#183;&#183;&#183;Si(II) cooperative activation mechanisms and provide insights into the role of bis&#8208;silylenes for selective N&#9552;N cleavage reactions.

         <title>Helical Columnar Liquid Crystal Exhibiting Both Polarization Retention and Ferroelectric Switching at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A star&#8208;shaped liquid crystal containing a polar 1,2,3&#8208;triazole group demonstrates a helical columnar assembly formed through triazolyl hydrogen bonding, resulting in stable axial macrodipoles. These macrodipoles can be ferroelectrically switched and consistently maintain a parallel arrangement even after the field is removed. The ferroelectric properties are operable at room temperature.








Abstract
Ferroelectric columnar liquid crystals (FCLCs) with switchable bistable axial polarizations are promising candidates for high&#8208;density ferroelectric random&#8208;access memory (FeRAM). However, FCLCs simultaneously exhibiting uniform polarization arrangement and ferroelectric switching at room temperature (RT) remain elusive. Herein, we report an RT&#8208;operable FCLC based on C3&#8208;symmetric star&#8208;shaped mesogen with polar linkers. Two CLCs, 1 and 2, were synthesized incorporating 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and amide linkers, respectively. 1 undergoes a ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition accompanied by a structural change from helical to a nonhelical columnar phase. Notably, the ferroelectric switching is operable down to RT, with complete retention of its axial macrodipole after removal of the electric field. In contrast, 2 forms only a nonhelical columnar LC phase, displaying paraelectric behavior. The contrasting self&#8208;assembly and dielectric properties are attributed to the differences in the polar unit size. This study demonstrates that the mesogen extension with a bulky 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker enables the realization of an&#160;FCLC operable at RT, offering significant potential for high&#8208;density FeRAM applications.

         <title>An Atmosphere&#8208;Responsive Protective Strategy Based on Deciphering the Anode Degradation Mechanism in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the intrinsic degradation mechanism of lithium anodes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and proposes a water&#8208;responsive protective layer to prevent harmful side reactions. The designed protection strategy responds to environmental composition, ensuring anode stability and battery operation, which provides guidance for the practical application and development of advanced and durable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, with high energy density and CO2 utilization, are considered a promising candidate for Mars exploration. However, they continue to face challenges such as limited cycle life and significant polarization caused by anode degradation, which is often overlooked and whose underlying mechanism remains unclear. This work revealed the anode failure mechanism, identifying a water&#8208;triggered degradation process, which depletes active lithium content, and developed an atmosphere&#8208;induced protective strategy. The degradation is triggered by trace water and sustained by the CO2 component, which results in transforming active lithium into Li2CO3. Thus, a strategy was provided to respond to the water molecules brought by the semi&#8208;hermetic system and high charging voltage. The protective layer was in situ polymerized and can interact with water molecules, leading to further polymerization, thereby inhibiting side reactions, significantly extending the battery's lifespan. The Li&#8211;CO2 batteries can achieve stable cycling exceeding 1000&#160;h, more than twice the time compared to the unprotected case. This study revealed the fundamental mechanism of anode degradation in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, providing a theoretical basis for the development of subsequent anode protection strategies. Additionally, it offers a viable method for anode protection in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

High defective Fe2O3 nanoparticles on Cu synthesis by plasma introduced multifunctional oxygen vacancies achieving 100% NH3 selectivity through a plasma&#8208;electrochemical system capable of directly reducing air to gaseous NH3.








Abstract
Current ammonia (NH&#8323;) synthesis is hindered by challenges including N&#8322; activation, NH&#8323; separation and process complexity. Here, we report a plasma&#8208;electrochemical process for the production of gaseous ammonia from air generated NOx, decoupled from processes employing liquid phase intermediaries such as NO&#8323;&#8315; and final product (NH4+). Importantly, this process uses air for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions and directly produces gaseous NH&#8323; which facilitates efficient product separation. For NOx reduction to NH&#8323;, we propose a universal strategy combining plasma pretreatment and wet chemical calcination to introduce multifunctional oxygen vacancies. The resulting highly defective Fe&#8322;O&#8323; nanoparticles on Cu achieves a significant ammonia production rate of 628 nmol&#183;s&#8315;&#185;&#183;cm&#8315;2, along with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Family of Chiral Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a Fused Sidechain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain was synthesized and used as efficient ligands in three copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reactions at the catalyst loading of 1&#160;mol%, including SN2&#8242; silylation, conjugate silylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and silylation of azadienes.








Abstract
Although a considerable number of chiral nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been developed yet it is highly necessary to develop new NHCs bearing multiple sites for facile modifications of both electronic nature and steric hindrance. Herein, we uncover a new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain, whose precursors are synthesized by a simple five&#8208;step route. The synthesis includes Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling or nucleophilic addition/oxidation, chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinolines, bromination at C8, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, and cyclization with methyl orthoformate. Among nine prepared NHCs, YC&#8208;NHC8 is the optimal ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric SN2&#8242; silylation, YC&#8208;NHC3 works as the best ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate silylation of simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and YC&#8208;NHC9 serves as the most suitable ligand for copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric silylation of azadienes. Remarkably, these three reactions are successfully run under a catalyst loading of 0.1&#160;mol%, indicating that YC&#8208;NHCs may have the potential to be broadly used in efficient asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts With Improved Metal Loading for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>

Replacing Zn atoms with Fe in Fe1&#8211;Zn1&#8211;N&#8211;C, a porphyrin MOF&#8208;pyrolyzed porous carbon involving single&#8208;atom Fe and Zn sites, affords FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C with improved single&#8208;atom Fe loading. The resulting FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C exhibits an exceptionally high ammonia synthesis rate under mild conditions (1 atm, 300 &#176;C), significantly outperforming all other counterparts, the traditional dominant fused iron and Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.








Abstract
Ammonia synthesis is a cornerstone in the chemical industry. Given that the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process requires very high temperature and pressure, it is imperative to develop catalysts capable of facilitating ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. In this work, a post&#8208;metal replacement strategy is developed to improve the Fe loading in single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;implanted N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts. Starting from the Zn&#8211;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C material with single&#8208;atom Zn and Fe sites coexisting in N&#8208;doped porous carbon pyrolyzed from porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the replacement of single&#8208;atom Zn with Fe sites is performed, which significantly increases the Fe loading from 1.33 to 2.39 wt%. This effectively suppresses the migration and agglomeration of Fe, yielding Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C with high metal loading (FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C). Notably, the FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a catalytic rate of 558&#160;&#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 300 &#176;C for ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure, far surpassing the performance of the traditional dominant fused iron and even Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Inverted Chiroptical Properties of Hybrid Metal Halides Through Reversible Chiral Induction Driven by External and Internal Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible chiral induction strategy has achieved chiroptical property inversion of chiral hybrid metal halides driven by external and internal chirality transfer from a single chiral reagent. Both externally and internally induced chiral crystals exhibit significant chiroptical response, photoluminescence, and second harmonic generation. The multi&#8208;path chirality transfer provides new insights for construction of functional chiral materials.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) are commonly constructed by introducing pairs of enantiomorphic chiral precursors through a single chirality transfer pathway, which may limit the regulation of chiral structural diversity and chiroptoelectronic properties. Herein, we propose a new strategy for achieving reversible chiral induction of OIHMHs with inverted chiroptical properties through external and internal chirality transfer pathways, by utilizing a single chiral reagent R&#8208;/S&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA). Specifically, R&#8208;MBA can externally induce chiral enrichment of M&#8208;DMA4(Bi0.486In0.511Sb0.003)Cl7 (M&#8208;DMA4(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl7, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylammonium cation) without integrating into structure. Conversely, R&#8208;MBA can insert into structure, internally inducing the formation of DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi0.634In0.362Sb0.004)Cl6 (DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl6), which reverses&#160;the structural arrangements and inverts both linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. Both externally and internally induced chiral OIHMHs exhibit significant chiroptical responses with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and second harmonic generation (SHG). Moreover, the externally induced centimeter&#8208;sized rhombic single crystal enables morphology&#8208; and angle&#8208;dependent inverted circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of &#8764;0.02, through single crystal anisotropy. The internal induction enhances SHG intensity by nine&#8208;fold and increases PLQY to 98.9%. This multi&#8208;path chirality transfer, based on a single chiral reagent, can significantly broaden the structural scope of functional chiral OIHMH materials and facilitate the regulation of chiroptoelectronic properties.

         <title>Lattice Water Deprotonation Enables Potassium&#8208;Ion Chemistries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abnormal water deprotonation in a lattice has been predicted in a chained model by density functional theory calculations and further verified by isotropic tracing and experimental electrochemical investigations. The lattice water deprotonation reaction in the initial charging process enables thereafter reversible potassium&#8208;ion insertion/desertion.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a key process in clean energy applications and usually occurs on the surface of catalytic materials. Here, we report the anomalous partial water splitting, namely, water deprotonation behavior within the lattice of hydrated materials modeled by Fe1&#8208;xMgx(C2O4) &#8226; 2H2O (x&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.25&#8211;0.43), which triggers the otherwise inactive framework into an excellent cathode material for potassium ion storage. Density functional theory suggests that redox&#8208;active lattice Fe sites can split crystal water into hydroxyls and hydrogens in the initial charge, rendering thereafter reversible K&#8208;ion chemistries, whereas lattice Mg sites are inactive but stabilize the entire framework. Our experiments validated the as&#8208;predicted electrochemical behavior, and the isotopic tracing unambiguously confirmed the hydrogen evolution from crystal water. This intriguing &#8220;water deprotonation in lattice&#8221; phenomenon may open a new path for the design of cathode materials by electrolysis&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.

         <title>closo&#8208;Carboranyl Analogs of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines: Direct Synthesis from Alkenes via EnT&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to directly synthesize closo&#8208;carboranyl analogs of medicinal chemically important &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines from alkenes is reported. This reaction is enabled by the first formation of closo&#8208;carboranyl radicals by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis and its unique mechanistic features. Several analogs of known bioactive compounds were obtained after downstream modifications.








Abstract
closo&#8208;Carboranes are icosahedral carbon&#8211;boron clusters with unique properties and broad applicability. They particularly stand out in the context of drug development as privileged structural motifs for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and as highly hydrophobic bioisosteres for the rotational volume of phenyl rings. Herein, we unveil the synthesis of N&#8208;protected carboranyl analogs of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines&#8212;widely found structural motifs in biologically active molecules&#8212;via a one&#8208;step alkene difunctionalization approach. Key for our success were the enabling mechanistic characteristics of energy transfer catalysis which we have used for the first time to generate closo&#8208;carboranyl radicals. Downstream modifications gave a series of analogs of amino acids and known N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists.

         <title>Synergistic Ru Species on Poly(heptazine imide) Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with H2O beyond 800 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst is assembled by precisely anchoring Ru SAs and NPs on PHI via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#9472;N bonds, creating a build&#8208;in electron field (BIEF) that directs charge separation and rushes electron migration to Ru NPs, together with an Ru SA&#8208;induced impurity level to extend optical harvesting. The catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for CO2 reduction with H2O, affording a record&#8208;high AQE beyond 800&#160;nm, while generating the valuable oxidation product H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion with H2O to carbonaceous fuels is a desirable strategy for CO2 management and solar utilization, yet its efficiency remains suboptimal. Herein, efficient and durable CO2 photoreduction is realized over a RuNPs/Ru&#8208;PHI catalyst assembled by anchoring Ru single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) onto poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) via the in&#8208;plane Ru&#8208;N4 coordination and interfacial Ru&#8208;N bonds, respectively. This catalyst shows an unsurpassed CO production (32.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1), a record&#8208;high apparent quantum efficiency (0.26%) beyond 800&#160;nm, and the formation of the valuable H2O2. Ru SAs tune PHI's electronic structure to promote in&#8208;plane charge transfer to Ru NPs, forming a built&#8208;in electron field at the interface, which directs electron&#8208;hole separation and rushes excited electron movement from Ru&#8208;PHI to Ru NPs. Simultaneously, Ru SAs introduce an impurity level in PHI to endow long&#8208;wavelength photoabsorption, while Ru NPs strengthen CO2 adsorption/activation and expedite CO desorption. These effects of Ru species together effectively ensure CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The CO2 reduction on the catalyst is revealed to follow the pathway CO2&#8594; *CO2&#8594; *COOH&#8594; *CO&#8594; CO, based on the intermediates identified by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and further supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover&#8208;Induced Br&#248;nsted Acidity Enables Controllable Hydrocracking of Polyolefin Waste to Liquid Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/NbOx nanorod catalyst enables efficient polyolefin hydrocracking, achieving 95% yield of liquid fuels (C5&#8211;20) under mild conditions. Operando spectroscopy and DFT reveal Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated via hydrogen spillover, as key catalytic sites, exhibiting a near&#8208;linear correlation with hydrocracking activity.








Abstract
Efficient upcycling of polyolefin waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to over&#8208;cracking and the lack of sufficient acidity in non&#8208;zeolitic catalysts. Here, we report a Ni/niobium oxide nanorod (Ni/NbOx) catalyst that achieves 95% selectivity to C5&#8211;20&#8203; alkanes at full polyethylene (PE) conversion under mild conditions (240&#160;&#176;C), with minimal gaseous products (4%). The catalyst reaches a high liquid fuel formation rate of 1274 gliquid&#8203; gNi&#8722;1&#8203; h&#8722;1, rivaling noble metal systems. Its performance is governed by the morphology and crystallinity of NbOx nanorods, which provide sufficient acidity without micropore confinement, mitigating diffusion limitations and over&#8208;cracking. Detailed operando infrared spectroscopy and computational studies reveal, for the first time, that Br&#248;nsted acid sites, generated in situ via hydrogen spillover on the (110) facet, are the key catalytic sites in niobium oxide&#8208;based catalysts. The density of these acid sites exhibits a linear correlation with hydrocracking activity. The catalyst also demonstrates high efficiency across diverse polyolefin feedstocks and excellent reusability, offering a scalable and cost&#8208;effective solution for plastic upcycling.

A novel enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers was enabled by a chiral cobalt complex and a chiral iron complex coordinated with the same ligand. The protocol delivered various chiral 2H&#8208;azirines and its derivatives under thermal or photolytic conditions with excellent efficiency (0.05 mol% catalyst loading). Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the conformational change of intermediates regulates the lateness of the transition states.








Abstract
A metal&#8208;controlled enantiodivergent rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto oxime ethers has been developed. Switching the metal catalyst from Co(II) to Fe(II) with an identical ligand completely reverses the asymmetric induction. Both enantiomers of chiral 2H&#8208;azirines and its derivatives are accessible under thermal or photolytic conditions. The cobalt&#8208;based reaction is highly efficient even at 0.05 mol% catalyst loading. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments and density functional theory calculations, reveal that distinct electronic properties of cobalt and iron modulate intermediate conformations, thereby altering the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Cooperativity of Electron Transfer Coupled Spin Transitions in a Tetranuclear Fe/Co Prussian Blue Analogue Revealed by Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopies show that irradiation of a square Fe/Co Prussian blue analogue induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast spin crossover, and coupled equilibria between all states trigger a second electron transfer coupled to spin crossover in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit on a ns timescale. This represents a unique case of cooperative two&#8208;step switching on a molecular level.








Abstract
Cooperative intermolecular interactions, usually observed in solid state, can confer useful properties to stimuli&#8211;responsive spin transition materials. Here, we demonstrate for the first time intramolecular cooperativity between the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits of a molecular cyanido&#8208;bridged square Fe2Co2 Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in solution, which upon single photon excitation sequentially undergo electron transfer coupled spin transition (ETCST) from a diamagnetic low&#8208;spin (LS) to a paramagnetic high&#8208;spin (HS) state. Ultrafast UV&#8211;vis and IR pump&#8208;probe spectroscopies show that irradiation into the IVCT band of the LS state induces electron transfer within one Fe&#8211;Co subunit followed by fast (360 fs) SCO to an intermediate HS/LS species and a further ETCST event in the other Fe&#8211;Co subunit then occurs on a ns timescale. Kinetic analysis reveals that this cooperative switching of the two Fe&#8211;Co subunits is caused by two coupled equilibria favouring the second ETCST step, and the free energy landscape for the square Fe2Co2 system is determined experimentally.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Divergent Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes With Quinones for the Synthesis of Diverse Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions between bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and quinones yield diverse polycyclic molecules. Specifically, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs afford bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, monosubstituted variants undergo cascade transformations to benzoxepines, disubstituted BCBs enable the stereoselective assembly of tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofurans, while strong Lewis acids induce the formation of halogenated cyclobutane derivatives through a ring&#8208;opening reaction.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) are highly strained hydrocarbons with unique structural properties and intrinsic reactivity, making them valuable building blocks for constructing complex molecular architectures. Herein, we report the Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed divergent reactions of BCBs with quinones, yielding a diverse array of polycyclic molecules. Using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as a catalyst, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs efficiently undergo formal (3&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition reactions with quinones, producing highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes featuring a caged framework. Monosubstituted BCB ketones undergo a sequential cascade involving Alder&#8208;ene reaction, 4&#960; electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening, and [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction, yielding fused benzoxepines efficiently. Disubstituted BCB esters, ketones, and amides undergo a tandem isomerization and (3&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition process, stereoselectively yielding tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofuran products. Notably, strong Lewis acids such as SnCl&#8324; and BiBr&#8323; directly participate in the ring&#8208;opening reactions of monosubstituted BCB ketones, generating halogenated cyclobutane derivatives. Additionally, the synthetic potential of these approaches has been further highlighted through scale&#8208;up experiments and a range of transformations. This study demonstrates the tunability of reaction pathways based on the diverse substitution patterns of BCBs, providing efficient methods for the synthesis of a range of polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Giant Birefringence Enabled by the Highly Anisotropic Linear IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br) Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel, easily grown birefringent crystals featuring linear interhalogen birefringence&#8208;active groups, IX&#8322;&#8315; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), namely [H&#8208;4AP][ICl&#8322;], [HDMA]&#8322;[ICl&#8322;]&#183;Cl, [H&#8208;4AP][IBr&#8322;], and [HDMA]&#8322;[IBr&#8322;]&#183;Br, exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions, while achieving an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap. 








Abstract
Birefringent crystals are essential for polarized optical devices, yet achieving large birefringence through rational design remains challenging. The key lies in constructing birefringence&#8208;active groups (BAGs) with giant polarization anisotropy and optimal spatial arrangements. Here, we report the successful construction of linear interhalogen BAGs, IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), enabling giant polarization anisotropy. This was accomplished by simple halogenation of IO3&#8722; groups in an aqueous solution. Four novel birefringent crystals were synthesized: [H&#8208;4AP][ICl2] (1, 4AP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;aminopyridine), [HDMA]2[ICl2]&#183;Cl (2, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylamine), [H&#8208;4AP][IBr2] (3), and [HDMA]2[IBr2]&#183;Br (4). In all these compounds, the linear IX2&#8722; BAG adopts parallel arrangements, effectively maximizing synergistic polarization anisotropy. As a result, compounds 1&#8211;4 exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible (0.647, 0.585, 0.836, and 0.782 at 546&#160;nm) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions (0.510, 0.356, 0.762, and 0.509 at 1064&#160;nm), surpassing commercial birefringent crystals and many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. Furthermore, these compounds achieve an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap among linear BAG&#8208;based materials. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the IX2&#8722; BAGs play a dominant role in this exceptional birefringence. This study demonstrates the remarkable potential of linear interhalogen anions for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.

         <title>Generation, Capture, Storage, and Release of Singlet Oxygen from a Perylene Diimide&#8208;Based Metallacage for Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop a metallacage capable of generating, capturing, storing, and releasing singlet oxygen through a reversible process. The system also features a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for dissolved oxygen due to reversible photoinduced electron transfer (PET) upon irradiation and heating. This work paves the way for designing metallacage&#8208;based smart materials for diverse photocatalytic and biological applications.








Abstract
The controlled generation and utilization of singlet oxygen (1O2) are crucial for its diverse applications but remain challenging due to its high reactivity and short&#8208;lived nature. Here, we report a box&#8208;shaped metallacage prepared via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using tetrapyridyl perylene diimide (PDI) and tetracarboxylate anthracene as building blocks. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation, the PDI faces act as photosensitizers to generate 1O2, which reacts with the anthracene pillars to form a peroxidized metallacage, where 1O2 is captured and stored as anthracene peroxides. Heating releases 1O2 quantitatively, restoring the original metallacage structure. Both states are stable at room temperature, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Additionally, photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from anthracene pillars to PDI faces quenches the emission of the metallacage, while oxidation of anthracene inhibits PET, yielding bright fluorescence for the peroxidized metallacage. This reversible emission change enables the metallacage to function as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for dissolved oxygen, with a detection limit of 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 mg&#160;L&#8722;1. This study demonstrates a metallacage that can generate, capture, store, and release 1O2 for oxygen sensing, offering insights for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials.

         <title>Surface Transformation in Lanthanum Nickelate for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the reconstruction mechanism of catalysts and designing methods to promote reconstruction are crucial for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) research. By employing a ferric ion surface pre&#8208;etching method, rapid reconstruction of the LaNiO3 catalyst is observed at low OER potentials, thus achieving high OER activity and stability.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based perovskite oxides are identified as promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in view of their low cost, highly tunable structure, and potential high activity. However, the performance and catalyst design are hindered by their sluggish surface reconstruction kinetics. We introduce a ferric ion pre&#8208;etching strategy to enhance the surface reconstruction of typical LaNiO3. The hydrolysis of ferric ions generates hydrated protons that corrode the La&#8208;O terminal sites, inducing lattice distortion and lowering the energy barrier for reconstruction. Concurrently, ferric ion substitution for Ni creates crucial active sites after OER reconstruction, and enables the low&#8208;activity LaNiO3 to become highly active and superior to the benchmark RuO2 and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal substantial surface transformation from corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing NiO6 at 1.43&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the surface pre&#8208;etched sample (LNFeIII&#8208;spe). This reconstruction is initiated by the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and transitions to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), underscoring the transformation of distinct OER mechanisms.

         <title>Bridging the Interlayer Binding to Ordered &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Units for Constructing High&#8208;Performing Light Polarization Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, two cases of alkali metal guanidine&#8208;formates 1Na and 2K were synthesized by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units, where 1Na maintains large birefringence while overcoming the layered growth habit. The evaluation of 1Na from synthesis to growth to preliminary optical devices was completed, and its optical properties, strong interlayer interaction, and the source of crystal structure stability were analyzed through theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The light polarization modulation involves the capacity to respond selectively to light&#8208;mater interaction and is dependent on the optical anisotropy of crystalline materials. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated component is almost typically utilized to produce such materials in the short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region; however, the conflicting link between high optical anisotropy and strong layered habit is difficult to reconcile. As a result, many anisotropic crystals are limited to tiny crystals rather than processing optical devices. This study designs crystals with beneficial but easy&#8208;to&#8208;grow layered structure and strong optical anisotropy by bridging the interlayer binding to ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. To this end, two new hybrid crystals Na2[C(NH2)3][HCOO]3 (1Na) and K2[C(NH2)3][HCOO]3 (2K) are reported by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The strong interlayer interaction and stable crystal structure of 1Na have been found to be caused by the orbital hybridization and Lewis acidity of Na+ and [HCOO] groups. This allows for the easy growth of centimeter&#8208;large, high optical quality 1Na single crystals, providing crystal assurance for all&#8208;around testing for a practical crystal. Using the most accurate minimal deviation angle method, the birefringence is measured to be 0.174&#8211;0.258 @253&#8208;1013&#160;nm, surpassing all reported crystals with the same components of [HCOO] or [C(NH2)3] in the applied short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region as well as the corresponding commercial crystals. More importantly, preliminary Glan&#8211;Taylor prism is designed to test its light polarization ability. This work will serve as a guide for future research on innovative short&#8208;wave ultraviolet birefringent crystals.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stable Gold Nanoparticles with Tunable Surface Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 27, July 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were achieved through in situ free&#8208;radical polymerization, resulting in a single&#8208;loading structure with controllable morphology and tunable surface properties. The crosslinked polymer shell surrounding the nanoparticles contributes to enhanced stability, excellent biocompatibility, and prolonged blood circulation in mice.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), as a class of functional nanomaterials, have attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications owing to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, colloidal solutions of Au NPs are thermodynamically unstable because of their high surface energy, resulting in poor stability and biocompatibility in physiological environments. Herein, we present a novel strategy for coating Au NPs using in situ polymerization to form a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network polymer shell around each particle. This approach enables the creation of an ultra&#8208;stable core&#8208;shell structure that effectively improves biocompatibility and stability, even in complex biological environments. The surface characteristics of the polymer shell can also be precisely tailored by carefully selecting the monomers to meet biomedical application requirements. These properties enable prolonged circulation within the bloodstream and enhanced tumor targeting in mice. This strategy offers an ultra&#8208;stable, aqueous&#8208;based, and biocompatible polymer shell for Au NPs, paving the way for the surface modification of gold nanomaterials in biomedical applications.

         <title>Taxonomy of Chemical Bondings: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

         <dc:description>
The recent focus on supramolecular and nanosized systems produced a major increase in the types of observed noncovalent interactions and in the diversity of terms used to designate them. A hierarchical categorization (taxonomy) of terms used to designate electrophile&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interactions is proposed here. Core elements of this classification are some recent IUPAC definitions referring to the electrophile.








Abstract
The concept of the chemical bond is fundamental to chemistry, governing atomic interactions that define all known matter. Despite this central role, the classification and most convenient naming of chemical bonds remain subjects of debate due to the diverse theoretical models and experimental observations. Modelings from quantum mechanical calculations and heuristic principles from experimental observations offer valuable and complementary insights, but sometimes the match and coalescence of these different approaches into a common terminology is not immediate. This paper describes a hierarchical categorization of noncovalent interactions based on the electrophilic atom involved, aligning with IUPAC definitions of hydrogen bonding (HB), halogen bonding (HaB), chalcogen bonding (ChB), and pnictogen bonding (PnB). The resulting taxonomy may avoid some ambiguities that arise from naming interactions based on single chemical/physical features. The proposed categorization that moves from more general and comprehensive terms to more specific and descriptive terms may ensure clarity, comprehensiveness, consistency with periodic trends, and invariancy over evolving understanding of the chemical bonds so that findings can be communicated and stored effectively via both human and machine based protocols.
