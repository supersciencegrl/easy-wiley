         <title>The Growth Mechanism of a Conductive MOF Thin Film in Spray&#8208;based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy (LBL&#8208;LPE) method is widely used in preparing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) thin films with merits of controlling thickness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation for superior performances in applications. The LBL&#8208;LPE growth mechanism related to the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation is critical but very challenging to study. In this work, a novel &#8220;in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limiting and self&#8208;repairing&#8221; thin&#8208;film growth mechanism is demonstrated by the combination study of the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation of Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;xC thin film via microscopic analysis techniques and electrical measurements. This mechanism results a desired high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientation at its bottom for the first time, and is very helpful for optimizing the LBL&#8208;LPE method, understanding the growth cycle&#8208;dependent properties of MOF thin film, and inspiring the investigations of the biomimetic self&#8208;repairing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO  2  , while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (  Ni&#8722;N  5  &#8722;C  ) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97% over &#8722;0.8 ~ &#8722;2.4 V  vs.  RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4 V  vs.  RHE reached a maximum of 1.23 A cm  &#8722;2  (turnover frequency of 69.7 s  &#8722;1  ) with an FE of 99.6%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100 hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N  4  site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N  5  site has   an increase and a decrease in the d  z  2 and d  xz/yz  orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N  5  catalytic site is more superior to activate CO  2  molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8211;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Enantiodivergence in Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation with &#946;&#8208;Alkenyl Allylic Boronates</title>

Abstract
We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;&#8208;alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenyl&#8208;substituted chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;&#8208;vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with R absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with S absolute configuration. Unusual substrate&#8208;catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.

&lt;p&gt;We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;-alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6-Di-9-anthracenyl-substituted chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;-vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;-2-propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; absolute configuration. Unusual substrate-catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Crystal Packing by Terminal tert&#8208;Butylation for Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Emission and Efficacious Charge Transport in an Anthracene&#8208;Based Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal with a unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif has been developed by delicate crystal engineering through terminal tert&#8208;butylation. Appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling/electron&#8208;phonon coupling originating from the unique crystal packing induces a remarkably strong solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum efficiency, &#934;F=74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1).







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with combinative high carrier mobility and efficient solid&#8208;state emission are full of challenges but urgently pursued for developing new emerging optoelectronics. Herein, by delicately regulating the crystal packing of an anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal via terminal tert&#8208;butylation, we developed a superior high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;di(6&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnaphthyl)anthracene (TBU&#8208;DNA). The unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif of TBU&#8208;DNA enables its appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling and electron&#8208;phonon coupling, thus resulting in remarkably high solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;F&#8776;74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, OLETs based on TBU&#8208;DNA show an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest EQE values for single component OLETs reported till now. This work presents a crystal engineering strategy via exquisite molecular design to realize high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to Tetra&#8208; and Tri&#8208;Substituted Fluoro&#8208; and Chloro&#8208;Borylalkenes via Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generated bench&#8208;top stable fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes and their application to the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes via the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported. To demonstrate their synthetic utility, the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes were transformed to fluoroalkene derivatives and all&#8208;carbon substituted alkenes.







Abstract
Reported herein is the efficient synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes by the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction of ketones and aldehydes with bench&#8208;top stable halo&#8208;diborylmethanes. The substrate scope is broad and the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction proceeds from a diverse range of ketones and aldehydes including biologically relevant molecules with fluoro&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes, providing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes in good yields with high stereoselectivity. The utilities of the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes are highlighted by further modifications to afford fluoroalkene derivatives or all&#8208;carbon substituted alkene.

         <title>High&#8208;Power Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous All Organic Redox Flow Battery Enabled with a Pair of Anionic Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) operating upon a pair of judiciously designed anionic viologen and TEMPO derivatives, endows the near&#8208;neutral electrolyte systems with compatibility to the cation&#8208;exchange membrane (CEM), high cell voltage, excellent cycling stability and record&#8208;high power density.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are regarded as a promising alternative for low&#8208;cost and durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the narrow potential gap, chemical lability and membrane fouling in most AORFBs constitute formidable roadblocks for practical applications. Herein, a pair of anionic organic molecules, namely (PPBPy)Br2 and PSS&#8208;TEMPO, are proposed. The (PPBPy)Br2 in anolyte reveals remarkable electrochemical stability without degradation after 1000&#8197;cycles, while PSS&#8208;TEMPO in catholyte presents a capacity decay rate as low as 0.012&#8201;%/cycle. At near&#8208;neutral conditions, the (PPBPy)Br2/PSS&#8208;TEMPO flow cell exhibits a high voltage of 1.61&#8197;V, extremely low permeability across cation&#8208;exchange membrane and thus excellent cycling stability. Notably, a highest peak power density of 509&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved among reported all&#8208;organic aqueous RFBs. The molecular engineering strategies demonstrated here could provide a credible example of high&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Lactonization of Enynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein the first oxidation of enynyl boronates for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, including spiro&#8208;, and fused&#8208;butanolides as well as butenolides that are prevalent in nature products and bioactive molecules. The asymmetric version of this oxidation was also achieved in the presence of chiral ketone and Oxone. This process successively involves the oxidation of C(sp)&#8722;B bond, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond, and the lactonization.







Abstract
Oxidation of C&#8722;B bonds is extensively used in organic synthesis, materials science, and chemically biology. However, these oxidations are usually limited to the oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;B and C(sp2)&#8722;B bonds. The C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation is rarely developed. Herein we present a novel strategy for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones via the oxidation of enynyl boronates. This process successively involves the C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond and the lactonization. This protocol provided various &#947;&#8208;lactones and unsaturated butenolides efficiently that are prevalent in numerous nature products and bioactive molecules. Most importantly, asymmetric oxidative lactonization of enynyl boronates was also achieved, providing chiral &#947;&#8208;lactones in high enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. The versatile transformations and ubiquity of &#947;&#8208;lactones shed light on the importance of this strategy in the construction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Unravelling the Reactivity of Framework Lewis Acid Sites towards Methanol Activation on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al Lewis acid sites that are bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations. The high reactivity of these framework&#8208;associated Al sites leads to the preferable formation of methoxy species in methanol reaction at lower temperature, which contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons at high temperature as active C1 species.







Abstract
Understanding the acid sites on zeolites is vital for the establishment of catalyst structure&#8211;activity relationship and exploration of their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the identification of active framework Lewis acid sites on ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites. The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al that is bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined by using one&#8208; dimensional (1D) 31P and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 31P&#8208;{27Al} NMR spectroscopy of trimethylphosphine oxide probe molecule. 2D 13C&#8208;{27Al} NMR correlation experiments allow the observation of favorable formation of methoxy species on the framework&#8208;associated Al Lewis acid sites in methanol reaction at low temperature, which is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These methoxy species contribute to the further conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons as active C1 species. The results provide new insights into the Lewis acidity of zeolites.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Circulating Vector for Aptamers Based upon Polyphosphodiester&#8208;Backboned Molecular Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottlebrush polymer&#8208;aptamer biohybrid, termed PSP pacDNA, is prepared using solid&#8208;phase and graft&#8208;onto methodologies. Consisting of a polyphosphodiester backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains, the PSP pacDNA suppresses non&#8208;specific interactions with the cell and improves the plasma pharmacokinetics of the aptamer. Combined with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer, the PSP pacDNA produces a pronounced anticoagulation effect in vivo.







Abstract
Aptamers face challenges for use outside the ideal conditions in which they are developed. These difficulties are most palpable in vivo due to nuclease activities, rapid clearance, and off&#8208;target binding. Herein, we demonstrate that a polyphosphodiester&#8208;backboned molecular brush can suppress enzymatic digestion, reduce non&#8208;specific cell uptake, enable long blood circulation, and rescue the bioactivity of a conjugated aptamer in vivo. The backbone along with the aptamer is assembled via solid&#8208;phase synthesis, followed by installation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains using a two&#8208;step process with near&#8208;quantitative efficiency. The synthesis allows for precise control over polymer size and architecture. Consisting entirely of building blocks that are generally recognized as safe for therapeutics, this novel molecular brush is expected to provide a highly translatable route for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A 3D Peptide/[60]Fullerene Hybrid for Multivalent Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent ligand presentation is a powerful strategy for the development of specific binders and inhibitors. Peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids have now been synthesized that exploit the complete substitution of the fullerene scaffold to afford globular structures presenting twelve copies of a peptide ligand for the recognition of E&#8208;selectin.







Abstract
Fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts offer an excellent opportunity for multivalent protein recognition. In contrast to monofunctionalized fullerene hybrids, peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts display multiple copies of a peptide in close spatial proximity and in the three dimensions of space. High affinity peptide binders for almost any target can be currently identified by in vitro evolution techniques, often providing synthetically simpler alternatives to natural ligands. However, despite the potential of peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts, these promising conjugates have not been reported to date. Here we present a synthetic strategy for the construction of 3D multivalent hybrids that are able to bind with high affinity the E&#8208;selectin. The here synthesized fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids and their multivalent recognition of natural receptors constitute a proof of principle for their future application as functional biocompatible materials.

         <title>Near Infrared Light Induced Radical Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near infrared irradiation can be sufficient to initiate radical polymerization when absorbed by gold nanorods, exploiting the photothermal effect to transfer energy to a thermal initiator molecule. A water&#8208;soluble monomer is readily polymerized in aqueous environments affording water&#8208;soluble polymers with tuneable molecular weights, including by irradiation through biological tissue.







Abstract
We introduce a gold nanorod (AuNR) driven methodology to induce free radical polymerization in water with near infrared light (800&#8197;nm). The process exploits photothermal conversion in AuNR and subsequent heat transfer to a radical initiator (here azobisisobutyronitrile) for primary radical generation. A broad range of reaction conditions were investigated, demonstrating control over molecular weight and reaction conversion of dimethylacrylamide polymers, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We underpin our experimental data with finite element simulation of the spatio&#8208;temporal temperature profile surrounding the AuNR directly after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. Critically, we evidence that polymerization can be induced through biological tissues given the enhanced penetration depth of the near infrared light. We submit that the presented initiation mechanism in aqueous systems holds promise for radical polymerization in biological environments, including cells.

         <title>Closed Aromatic Tubes&#8212;Capsularenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenes can now be incorporated into closed tubes&#8212;capsularenes. These rigid, electron deficient, thermally stable, and tubular molecules with three arenes or acenes at a close distance can lend themselves to the construction of organic electronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name capsularenes. First, we prepared vase&#8208;shaped molecular baskets 4&#8211;7. The baskets comprise a benzene base fused to three bicycle[2.2.1]heptane rings that extend into phthalimide (4), naphthalimide (6), and anthraceneimide sides (7), each carrying a dimethoxyethane acetal group. In the presence of catalytic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the acetals at top of 4, 6 and 7 change into aliphatic aldehydes followed by their intramolecular cyclization into 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (1H NMR spectroscopy). Such ring closure is nearly a quantitative process that furnishes differently sized capsularenes 1 (0.7&#215;0.9&#8197;nm), 8 (0.7&#215;1.1&#8197;nm;) and 9 (0.7&#215;1.4&#8197;nm;) characterized by X&#8208;Ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction, UV/Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and thermogravimetry. With exceptional rigidity, unique topology, great thermal stability, and perhaps tuneable optoelectronic characteristics, capsularenes hold promise for the construction of novel organic electronic devices.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Lanthanide Molecular Probes for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we developed clickable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling. In combination with metabolic labeling, these NIR Ln (Ln=Yb, Er) complexes enabled NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of proteins, glycans, and nucleic acids in cells. Furthermore, they were applied for multicolor imaging and NIR click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM). By combining these Ln probes with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), we achieved the first dual&#8208;modal NIRF&#8208;SIMS imaging.







Abstract
We report here the development of clickable and highly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules. These azide&#8208; or alkyne&#8208;functionalized Ln complexes are hydrophilic and fluorogenic, exhibiting a strong increase of NIR fluorescence upon conjugation with biomolecules. Metabolic labeling of biomolecules with azide or alkyne, followed by click labeling with the Ln complexes, enables NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans in cells. Furthermore, multicolor imaging is performed by combining click&#8208;labeling with the Ln complexes and immunostaining. In addition, the Ln complexes is compatible with click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM), which enables high&#8208;resolution NIRF imaging of cellular glycoproteins. Finally, the Ln complexes can be used for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging, thus achieving the first example of dual&#8208;modal imaging combining NIRF and SIMS microscopies.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Structure&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Hyperbranched Polymers by a &#8220;Latent&#8221; Inimer Strategy Based on Diels&#8211;Alder Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer, containing both a furan&#8208;protected maleimide (FMI) monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. Due to the dynamic nature of the r&#8208;DA reaction of FMI, the release of maleimide (MI) and the subsequent copolymerization of MI can be regulated by tuning the temperature and stereochemistry during its SCVCP.







Abstract
An efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (LI&#8208;Br), containing a furan&#8208;protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (r&#8208;DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the r&#8208;DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star&#8208;shaped and long&#8208;chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoviologens&#8208;appendant metallacycles M1 (rhomboid) and M2 (hexagonal) were synthesized and utilized in electrochromism and photocatalysis, as reported in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209054) by Gang He et&#8197;al. The highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states of the selenoviologens (SeV2+) originate from the metallacyclic effect. Their properties were validated by femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), demonstrating the vital role of the metallacycle in organic photocatalytic reactions.

A self&#8208;assembled glucose oxidase (GOx) nanoparticle that falls into the sea and dissociates into several enzymes is depicted in the picture illustrating the Research Article by Peng Huang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202208583). After dissociation, GOx regains its catalytic activity and catalyzes the oxidization of glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2. It's like someone pressing the&#160;&#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2&#8242;&#8242;&#160;switch that crosses the sea surface.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of a Xe(IV) Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;WOF4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;WOF4, was synthesized in CFCl3  solvent by reaction of the weak fluoride&#8208;ion donor and strong oxidative fluorinating agent, XeF4, with the moderate&#8208;strength fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor, WOF4. The compound is the only transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of Xe(IV) and was characterized at low temperatures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4  coordinate trans to the W=O bond through a W&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Fb  bond. The XeF3  moiety of F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;WOF4  acquires a degree of [XeF3]+  character upon coordination that is reflected by its stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF4  and [XeF3]+. Calculations show W&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Fb  is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8211;Fb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;W angle. The calculations show F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;MOF4  (M = Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;MoOF4.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and
Fluorination of Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically
Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8208;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Cyclopolymerization of 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;Nonadiyne Derivatives to Synthesize Low Band Gap Conjugated Polyacetylenes Containing Fused Bicyclic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopolymerization is a powerful method for synthesizing polyacetylenes containing four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered rings. However, the structure of the repeat unit only consists of mono&#8208;cycloalkene due to the single cyclization of diyne monomers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel cascade cyclopolymerization to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings from triyne monomers containing bulky dendrons via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. These dendrons provided solubility and stability to the rigid bicyclic polyacetylene backbone. In addition, we controlled the regioselectivity of the catalyst approach by altering its structure and synthesized polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings with high molecular weights of up to 120 kg/mol. Interestingly, the resulting polymers showed narrower band gaps (down to 1.6 eV) than polymers with mono&#8208;cycloalkene repeat units due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface passivation technology provides noble&#8208;metal materials with limited chemical stability, especially under highly acidic condition. To design effective strategy to enhance stabilility of noble&#8208;metal particles, an understanding of their surface anticorrosion mechanism at the atomic level is desirable by using two&#8208;dimensional (2D) noble&#8208;metal coordination polymer (CP) as an ideal model for their interfacial region. With the protection of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole (TBI), we isolated two Ag&#8208;based 2D CPs, {Ag14(TBI)12X2}n (S&#8208;X, where S denotes sheet and X = Cl or Br). These compounds exhibited excellent chemical stability upon immersion in various common solvents, boiling water, boiling ethanol, 10% hydrogen peroxide, concentrated acid (12 M HCl), and concentrated alkali (19 M NaOH). Systematic characterization and DFT analyses demonstrate that the superior stability of S&#8208;X was attributed to the hydrophobic organic shell and dynamic proton buffer layer acting as a double protective&#8220;shield&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  N  &#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamide unit is one of the privileged skeletons for drug development. Direct  N  &#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing  N  &#8208;(hetero)&#8208; aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulted from the previous condensation method. Although a number of catalytic systems have been developed, most known methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for coupling of sulfonamides with both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor (hetero)aryl halides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8208;5 mol% copper salts and oxalamides at 100  o  C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the action of 10 mol% Cu  2  O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide to afford  N  &#8208;aryl sulfonamides in excellent diversity. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula precisely calculated from mass spectroscopy. However, the complete structure determination by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution, which correlates well to their crystallographic structures. Besides, SANS also allows the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self&#8208;assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide&#8208;range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an  in&#8208;situ  phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full&#8208;scale phase&#8208;diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods. Moreover, the phase transition was accompanied by considerable aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity change for building a functional surface. This strategy allows for a conceptual advance of accessing a wide range of distinct self&#8208;assembled structures and functions in real time.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrotrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.</dc:description>

This minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2-to-HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrotrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Functionalities for Modulating Surface Potentials in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing materials with high triboelectric is an efficient way of improving output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Herein, we synthesized a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but various functional groups ranging between electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing. These COFs form an ideal platform for clarifying the contribution of each group to TENG performance because the pore wall is perturbed in a predesigned manner. Kelvin probe force microscopy and computational data suggest that surface potentials and electron affinities of COFs can be improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, with the highest values observed for fluorinated COF. The TENG with fluorinated COF delivered an output voltage and current of 420 V and 64 &#181;A, respectively, which are comparable to other reported materials. This strategy can be used to efficiently screen suitable frameworks as TENG materials with excellent output performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Radical SAM Enzymes Are Necessary and Sufficient for the In Vitro Production of the Oxetane Nucleoside Antiviral Agent Albucidin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxetanocin A and albucidin are two oxetane natural products. While the biosynthesis of oxetanocin A has been described, less is known about albucidin. In this work, the albucidin biosynthetic gene cluster is identified in  Streptomyces  . Heterologous expression in a nonproducing strain demonstrates that the genes  alsA  and  alsB  are necessary and sufficient for albucidin biosynthesis confirming a previous study ( Myronovskyi  et al  .  Microorganisms  2020  ,  8  , 237 ). A two&#8208;step construction of albucidin 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphate from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine monophosphate (2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP) is shown to be catalyzed  in vitro  by the cobalamin dependent radical  S  &#8208;adenosyl&#8208; l &#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which catalyzes elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. Isotope labelling studies show that AlsB catalysis begins with stereospecific H&#8208;atom transfer of the C2&#8242;&#8208;  pro&#8208;R  hydrogen from 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP to 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, and that the eliminated one&#8208;carbon fragment originates from C3&#8242; of 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport materials (HTMs) remain highly desirable for stable and efficient n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) but rarely succeed. Here, we propose a molecular assembly strategy to overcome the limited optoelectronic properties of organic HTMs by precisely designing a linear organic small molecule BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F from the atomic to the molecular levels. BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility and decreased energy disorder. The resultant pero&#8208;SCs showed a promising efficiency of 23.12% (certified 22.48%), which is the highest certified value of pero&#8208;SCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs, to date. These devices also showed a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 22.50% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 20.17% for 15.64&#8208;cm2 module. For the first time, the pero&#8208;SCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs realized ultralong stabilities with T80 lifetimes over 1200 h under operation or thermal aging at 85 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative (3+2) Cycloadditions between Indoles and Vinyldiazo Species Enabled by a Red&#8208;Shifted Chromium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct dearomative photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents is described. The transformation is enabled by the development of a novel oxidizing Cr(III) photocatalyst, its specific reactivity attributed to increased absorptive properties over earlier Cr analogs and greater stability than Ru counterparts. A variety of fused indoline compounds are synthesized using this method, including densely functionalized ring systems that are feasible due to base&#8208;free conditions. Experimental insights corroborate a cycloaddition initiated by nucleophilic attack at C3 of the indole radical cation by the vinyldiazo species.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficiency separation of C6 alkanes, particularly the mono&#8208; and dibranched isomers by using porous solids, is of paramount significance in the petrochemical industry and, remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we report the complete separation of linear/monobranched hexanes from their dibranched isomers through selective size&#8208;exclusion by a microporous MOF, Zn&#8208;tcpt (H3tcpt = 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine), with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of hms nets. Importantly, its adsorption capacity and selectivity are notably higher than those of the previously reported adsorbents that can split mono&#8208; and dibranched alkane isomers. Dynamic breakthrough measurements verify the excellent separation of C6 alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt, and the size&#8208;exclusion based separation mechanism has been confirmed by ab initio materials modeling. The high&#8208;efficiency separation of alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt can be attributed to its optimal pore dimensions as well as high porosity.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoxazole Nucleosides as Building Blocks for a Plausible Proto&#8208;RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The question of how RNA, as the principal carrier of genetic information evolved is fundamentally important for our understanding of the origin of life. The RNA molecule is far too complex to have formed in one evolutionary step, suggesting that ancestral proto&#8208;RNAs (first ancestor of RNA) may have existed, which evolved over time into the RNA of today. Here we show that isoxazole nucleosides, which are quickly formed from hydroxylamine, cyanoacetylene, urea and ribose, are plausible precursors for RNA. The isoxazole nucleoside can rearrange within an RNA&#8208;strand to give cytidine, which leads to an increase of pairing stability. If the proto&#8208;RNA contains a canonical seed&#8208;nucleoside with defined stereochemistry, the seed&#8208;nucleoside can control the configuration of the anomeric center that forms during the in&#8208;RNA transformation. The results demonstrate that RNA could have emerged from evolutionarily primitive precursor isoxazole ribosides after strand formation  .</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Anisotropic Facet of Lead Chromate Photocatalysts to Promote Spatial Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes correlates closely with the anisotropic facets of PbCrO4 crystals. Charge&#8208;separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relationship with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. An apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation was achieved after optimizing the anisotropic facets of the PbCrO4 crystals.







Abstract
A crucial issue in artificial photosynthesis is how to modulate the behaviors of photogenerated charges of semiconductor photocatalysts. Here, using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as an example, we conducted the morphology tailoring from parallelepiped (p&#8208;PbCrO4) to truncated decahedron (t&#8208;PbCrO4) and elongated rhombic (r&#8208;PbCrO4), resulting in exposed anisotropic facets. The spatial separation of photogenerated charges closely correlates to the anisotropic facets of crystals, which can only be realized for t&#8208;PbCrO4 and r&#8208;PbCrO4. The charge&#8208;separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relation with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. The r&#8208;PbCrO4 gives an apparent quantum efficiency of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation using Fe3+ ions as electron acceptors. Moreover, the oxidation reverse reaction from Fe2+ to Fe3+ ions was completely blocked with &#8764;100&#8201;% of Fe3+ conversion achieved on the anisotropic PbCrO4 crystals.

         <title>A Plurizyme with Transaminase and Hydrolase Activity Catalyzes Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PluriZyme with transaminase and esterase activities was constructed by combining computational and laboratory design methods. The enzyme can perform cascade reactions in a single protein scaffold. Experimental evidence is presented for the catalytic efficiency of both the native transaminase and the artificial esterase active site and their synergistic action to transform &#946;&#8208;keto esters into enantiopure &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Engineering dual&#8208;function single polypeptide catalysts with two abiotic or biotic catalytic entities (or combinations of both) supporting cascade reactions is becoming an important area of enzyme engineering and catalysis. Herein we present the development of a PluriZyme, TR2E2, with efficient native transaminase (kcat: 69.49&#177;1.77&#8197;min&#8722;1) and artificial esterase (kcat: 3908&#8211;0.41&#8197;min&#8722;1) activities integrated into a single scaffold, and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR2E2 (pHopt: 8.0&#8211;9.5; Topt: 60&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3&#8208;(R)&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;&#8208;keto ester into the &#946;&#8208;keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently into the &#946;&#8208;amino acid (e.e. &gt;99&#8201;%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR2E2 PluriZyme was proven with a set of &#946;&#8208;keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.

         <title>A Specialized Polythioamide&#8208;Binding Protein Confers Antibiotic Self&#8208;Resistance in Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A central contributor to the self&#8208;resistance of an anaerobic antibiotic producer is identified. CtaZ, a new member of the GyrI&#8208;like superfamily, confines the gyrase inhibitor closthioamide in a ligand&#8208;optimized pocket. Genome mining uncovered CtaZ homologs encoded in the genomes of diverse bacteria, including numerous pathogens.







Abstract
Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is central to the development of anti&#8208;infective therapies and genomics&#8208;based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain regarding the resistance strategies employed against novel types of antibiotics from less&#8208;explored producers such as anaerobic bacteria, among them the Clostridia. Through the use of genome editing and functional assays, we found that CtaZ confers self&#8208;resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI&#8208;like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand&#8208;optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing both a new role for a GyrI&#8208;like domain in self&#8208;resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids in uncovering related drug&#8208;resistance mechanisms.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at the Electron&#8208;Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8722;C Coupling via a Carboranyl Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of carboranes was demonstrated by the photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron&#8208;vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. This strategy enables facile construction of highly efficient blue emitters and drug candidates for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).







Abstract
Functionalization of carboranes in a vertex&#8208;specific manner is a perennial challenge. Here, we report a photocatalytic B&#8722;C coupling for the selective functionalization of carboranes at the boron site which is most distal to carbon. This reaction was achieved by the photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that the reaction more easily occurs at the boron site bearing higher electron density owing to the lower energy barrier for a single&#8208;electron transfer to generate a carboranyl radical. By using this strategy, a number of functionalized carboranes could be accessed through alkylation, alkenylation, and heteroarylation under mild conditions. Moreover, both a highly efficient blue emitter with a solid&#8208;state luminous efficiency of 42&#8201;% and a drug candidate for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) containing targeting and fluorine units were obtained.

         <title>Identification and Structure Analysis of an Unusual Halohydrin Dehalogenase for Highly Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Bio&#8208;Nitration of Epoxides</title>

         <dc:description>
An unusual halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHamb was identified for highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides. Enantiopure &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols containing nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenters were synthesized on preparative scale by whole&#8208;cell biotransformation. The enzyme structure was also solved and analyzed, providing a possible understanding of the chemoselectivity control mechanism in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.







Abstract
We report the discovery of an unusual halohydrin dehalogenase, HHDHamb, that can work under relatively low acidic conditions and extremely low temperatures for the bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides using nitrite as a nitrating agent. The bio&#8208;nitration strategy exhibits high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, catalyzing the kinetic resolution of various epoxides to enantiopure &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenters in up to 41&#8201;% isolated yield and &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). Additionally, the bio&#8208;nitration method displays a high reaction efficiency and can be performed on a gram scale. We also solved the crystal structure of HHDHamb to understand the possible structural determinants of chemoselectivity control in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Chiral Allylboronates by Asymmetric 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly 1,1&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselective alkenylboration of undirected and unactivated alkenes has been developed, which allows chiral allylboronates to be efficiently synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes, alkenyl bromides and B2pin2. This method is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, readily available starting materials, mild and convenient reaction conditions, scalability and practicality.







Abstract
We report herein a modular catalytic method for the efficient enantioselective synthesis of chiral allylboronates from abundant feedstock chemicals through an asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes. This protocol is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, mild and convenient reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, scalability and practicality. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of key intermediates of complex drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that &#946;&#8208;H elimination is a highly regioselective step and the reversible homolysis and convergance to the lower energy pre&#8208;reductive elimination intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Dihydroazulene&#8208;Based Photofluorochromic AIE System for Rewritable 4D Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dihydroazulene&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission system is developed and systematically investigated. The light&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and heat&#8208;driven closing processes endow it with controllable and quantitively described photofluorochromic properties. Accordingly, a rewritable 4D information encryption system with dynamic patterns is demonstrated, which shows a considerable data&#8208;storage capacity and multiple characteristics.







Abstract
Dynamic patterns based on luminescent materials play an essential role in the digital age. However, it is still challenging to develop highly emissive photofluorochromic materials with dynamic behaviors to store information with multiple characteristics. Here, we report a series of dihydroazulene&#8208;based compounds which show typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. Moreover, the photo&#8208;switching ability of the dihydroazulene units, undergoing light&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening, enables photofluorochromic properties. The photofluorochromism also shows quantitively described responses to time and temperature via a reverse ring&#8208;closing process. Ultimately, a rewritable 4D information system, embedded with a quick response code, dot matrix with microstructures, color matrix of fluorescence, and time/temperature&#8208;dependent intensity change, is established with dynamic patterns. This work not only develops a dynamic AIE skeleton with photofluorochromic properties but also provides a new strategy for information encryption and cybernetics.

         <title>Leveraging Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to Explore Structure&#8211;Property Relationships of Protein Immobilization in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal titration calorimetry was leveraged to systematically study how the structural properties of MOFs, such as hydrophobicity, pore size, and topology, influence the thermodynamics of protein immobilization by using a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs as the host and insulin as the model protein probe. The thermodynamics of binding can elucidate a major driving force for protein encapsulation, which could not be revealed in bulk adsorption studies.







Abstract
Proteins immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) often show extraordinary stability. However, most efforts to immobilize proteins in MOFs have only been exploratory. Herein, we present the first systematic study on the thermodynamics of protein immobilization in MOFs. Using insulin as a probe, we leveraged isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate how topology, pore size, and hydrophobicity of MOFs influence immobilization. ITC data obtained from the encapsulation of insulin in a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs reveals that MOFs provide proteins with a hydrophobic stabilizing microenvironment, making the encapsulation entropically driven. In particular, the pyrene&#8208;based NU&#8208;1000 tightly encapsulates insulin in its ideally sized mesopores and stabilizes insulin through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, resulting in the most enthalpically favored encapsulation process among this series. This study reveals critical insights into the structure&#8211;property relationships of protein immobilization.

         <title>Diborylmethyl Group as a Transformable Building Block for the Diversification of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established an efficient protocol for the preparation of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their use in homologative coupling with nitrogen nucleophiles to generate various nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes. The diborylmethyl group installed onto the nitrogen atom served as a versatile synthetic handle, allowing for the programmed diversification of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
The development of new approaches to installing diverse carbon fragments to a nitrogen atom has attracted considerable attention in chemical science. While numerous strategies have been devised to forge C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds, one conceptually powerful and straightforward approach is to insert a transformable sp3&#8208;carbon unit onto a nitrogen atom for modular diversification. Here we describe the successful synthesis of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their applications to the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes through their homologative coupling with a variety of nitrogen nucleophiles including biologically relevant molecules. This process exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, and the usefulness of the obtained compounds is demonstrated by the modular diversification of the diborylmethyl group to access various nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Route to Dewar 1,3,5&#8208;Triphosphabenzene and Subsequent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable iron&#8208;catalyzed route to a Dewar phosphabenzene is presented. This species isomerizes in the presence of base to form the 1,3,5&#8208;phosphabenzene, which then spontaneously rearranges to a novel triphospha(tricyclo) species. Onward coordination chemistry of all three phosphines is explored along with an extensive study into the reactivity of the Dewar phosphabenzene.







Abstract
The application of an alkyne cyclotrimerization regime with an [Fe(salen)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo (1) catalyst to triphenylmethylphosphaalkyne (2) yields gram&#8208;scale quantities of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(triphenylmethyl)&#8208;Dewar&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene (3). Bulky lithium salt LiHMDS facilitates a rearrangement of 3 to the 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene valence isomer (3&#8242;), which subsequently undergoes an intriguing phosphorus migration reaction to form the ring&#8208;contracted species (3&#8242;&#8242;). Density functional theory calculations provide a plausible mechanism for this rearrangement. Given the stability of 3, a diverse array of unprecedented transformations was investigated. We report novel crystallographically characterized products of successful nucleophilic/electrophilic addition and protonation/oxidation reactions.

         <title>Enhanced Solar Evaporation Using a Scalable MoS2&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Highly Efficient Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) was successfully constructed with a hydrophilic polyacrylamide as its skeleton and commercial MoS2 as the solar absorbent through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. The SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination.







Abstract
Interfacial photo&#8208;vapor conversion has been suggested as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable technology for seawater desalination. However, the conversion performance was still limited by some drawbacks, like salt accumulation and poor mechanical stability. Herein, a scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) with good mechanical stability and salt resistance was successfully constructed through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. With the high porosity (92.63&#8201;%), the SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination. Most importantly, the SMoS2&#8208;PH could maintain high and stable photothermal properties for 15&#8197;days on the surface of seawater. We believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial MoS2 make the SMoS2&#8208;PH a promising device for full&#8208;scale seawater desalination.

         <title>A Modular Co&#8208;assembly Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Perovskite Oxides with Abundant Surface Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular co&#8208;assembly method is developed to synthesize a series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxide/C composites and mesoporous perovskite oxides. Notably, the rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure of mesoporous La2Zr2O7 endow 94&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan.







Abstract
The ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with well&#8208;defined mesostrcture and versatile metal sites are attractive, but their successful synthesis faces challenges of complicated assembly dynamics and pore collapse in crystalline calcination. Here, we propose an energy balance concept to reveal interplay relationship in assembly process and realize regulation of porous structure for mesoporous perovskite oxides. A series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with unique porous structure were prepared by a modular co&#8208;assembly method. Mesoporous La2Zr2O7 shows 94&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Experiments reveal that rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure promote interaction between mesoporous La2Zr2O7 and HMF and reduce catalytic energy barrier. This work provides the insight into molecule co&#8208;assembly and developing multiple component ordered mesoporous materials.

         <title>Selective Confinement of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Hydrates by a Capped Metallo&#8208;Cage under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of a hydrated rare&#8208;earth metal ion in a hydrophobic cavity was demonstrated under aqueous conditions by a cooperative system of a synthetic coordination cage and a tripodal capping anion. By the cooperation of the cage cavity and the caps, selective recognition and separation of early lanthanoid ions were achieved.







Abstract
The properties of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in aqueous media often depend on their various hydration modes, which allow them to exist as monomeric or oligomeric species with different coordination numbers. Capturing rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in a confined cavity can fix their hydration modes and thus enable their intrinsic properties to be distinguished. However, the isolation of ionic species from bulk aqueous media is not an easy task due to competitive interaction with bulk water.

     alt="Selective Confinement of Rare-Earth-Metal Hydrates by a Capped Metallo-Cage under Aqueous Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encapsulation of a hydrated rare-earth metal ion in a hydrophobic cavity was demonstrated under aqueous conditions by a cooperative system of a synthetic coordination cage and a tripodal capping anion. By the cooperation of the cage cavity and the caps, selective recognition and separation of early lanthanoid ions were achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of rare-earth-metal ions in aqueous media often depend on their various hydration modes, which allow them to exist as monomeric or oligomeric species with different coordination numbers. Capturing rare-earth-metal ions in a confined cavity can fix their hydration modes and thus enable their intrinsic properties to be distinguished. However, the isolation of ionic species from bulk aqueous media is not an easy task due to competitive interaction with bulk water. Here, we report the encapsulation of hydrated rare-earth-metal ions in a hydrophobic cavity of a synthetic cage. Cap-like counter anions located at the cage's portals play an important role in capturing the rare-earth metals at a fixed position via electrostatic interactions. Preferential encapsulation of early lanthanoid (III) ions was observed even though all the rare-earth metals have the same hydration number and geometry, as visualized by the competitive inclusion of a dye molecule. Accordingly, the early lanthanoid ion was selectively extracted from a mixture of two rare-earth-metal ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cocrystallization Enabled Spatial Self&#8208;Confinement Approach to Synthesize Crystalline Porous Metal Oxide Nanosheets for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach has been developed to synthesize crystalline porous two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets. The mechanism is proposed and various crystalline porous metal oxides nanosheets can be obtained. The resulting crystalline porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets show exceptional sensing performance towards 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.







Abstract
Crystalline metal oxide nanosheets show exceptional catalytic performance owing to the large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and quantum confinement effect. However, it is still a challenge to develop a facile and general method to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Herein, we report a cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Taking the synthesis of SnO2 as an example, the solvent evaporation from KCl and SnCl2 solution induces the cocrystallization of KCl and K2SnCl6, and the obtained composite with encapsulated K2SnCl6 can be in situ converted into SnO2 nanosheets confined in KCl matrix, after water washing to remove KCl, porous SnO2 nanosheets can be obtained. Notably, a series of metal oxide nanosheets can be obtained through this general and efficient green route. In particular, porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets with improved surface O&#8722; species and abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit superior gas sensing performance to 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.

         <title>Polystyrene&#8208;based Macromolecular Ammonium Halides for Tuning Color and Exchange Kinetics of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium halide&#8208;containing polymers offer a convenient halide source for anion exchange with CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs), tuning their emission color from purple to red while simultaneously allowing formation of stable nanocomposite films. The polymer and its solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation state provide a handle to control inter&#8208;NC anion exchange kinetics, providing a simple solution&#8208;processable route to all&#8208;perovskite white emissive solutions and films.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis anion exchange of all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 NCs, where X=Cl, Br, and/or I) provides a rapid and simple means of tuning their band gap and photoluminescence emission wavelengths. Here we report color&#8208;shifting of CsPbX3 nanocrystals induced by a macromolecular source of halide ions, specifically using polystyrene with ammonium halides as pendent groups. This strategy for introducing new halides to the perovskite nanocrystals gave access to perovskite&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as solutions, thin films, or free&#8208;flowing powders. Spectroscopic measurements of the halide&#8208;exchanged nanocrystal products revealed high photoluminescence quantum yields across the visible spectrum, with exchange kinetics that were tunable based on the solution environment, suggesting an aggregation&#8208;inhibited exchange process that affords access to multi&#8208;colored solutions and films.

         <title>Gauging Radical Stabilization with Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical stabilization by carbenes is explored computationally. A donor/acceptor frontier orbital picture based on the allyl radical is presented, and allows one to understand and predict radical stabilization in organic radicals, carbene complexes of the transitions metals, as well as of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
Carbenes, including N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, are used extensively to stabilize open&#8208;shell transition metal complexes and organic radicals. Yet, it remains unknown, which carbene stabilizes a radical well and, thus, how to design radical&#8208;stabilizing C&#8208;donor ligands. With the large variety of C&#8208;donor ligands experimentally investigated and their electronic properties established, we report herein their radical&#8208;stabilizing effect. We show that radical stabilization can be understood by a captodative frontier orbital description involving &#960;&#8208;donation to&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation from the carbenes. This picture sheds a new perspective on NHC chemistry, where &#960;&#8208;donor effects usually are assumed to be negligible. Further, it allows for the intuitive prediction of the thermodynamic stability of covalent radicals of main group&#8208; and transition metal carbene complexes, and the quantification of redox non&#8208;innocence.

         <title>In Situ Periodic Regeneration of Catalyst during CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to maintain the high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction towards C2+ products over a copper catalyst. A positive potential pulse is applied periodically for a short time in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. As a result the surface structure and oxidation state of the Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method.







Abstract
Developing electrocatalytic reactions with high&#8208;efficiency can make important contributions to carbon neutrality. However, poor long&#8208;term stability of catalysts is a bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, an &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to give long&#8208;term high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to generate C2+ products over Cu catalyst by applying a positive potential pulse for a short time periodically in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. The high Faradaic efficiency (81.2&#8201;%) and current density (22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) could be maintained completely at least 36&#8197;h, while the activity and selectivity decreased continuously without using the PR&#8208;C method. Control experiments and operando characterization demonstrated that the surface structure and oxidation state of Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method, which was beneficial for CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Discrete Macrocycles with Fixed Chirality and Two Distinct Sides: Dipole&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle has enabled the synthesis of a series of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with various dipolar structures. Analysis of their enantiomers by chiroptical spectroscopy revealed that dipolar electronic distribution led to weak dissymmetry in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses, thus demonstrating the importance of reducing the nonsymmetry of macrocycles.







Abstract
Control of symmetry is fundamental in molecular design with aimed properties. Herein we report a set of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with variable dipolar structures based on a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle, pillar[5]arene. Incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing ester groups formed an explicit two&#8208;sided structure, leading to increase in response wavelength and luminescence efficiency. On the other hand, chiroptical measurement of separated enantiomers revealed that such a dipolar character diminished dissymmetry of the electronic transitions. By suppressing the dipole, the dissymmetry factor for luminescence was enhanced from 0.4&#215;10&#8722;3 to 5.1&#215;10&#8722;3 in a less dipolar methoxy&#8208;substituted molecule, which was larger than reported pillar[5]arene derivatives without C5&#8208;symmetry around one order of magnitude.

         <title>Discovery of the Biosynthetic Pathway of Beticolin 1 Reveals a Novel Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Dependent Oxygenase for Anthraquinone Ring Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 required for anthraquinone ring cleavage is discovered during elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, in which iron is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water based on its crystal structure. Moreover, Thr299 and His58 mediate Kcx377 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Thus, this work updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.







Abstract
This study used light&#8208;mediated comparative transcriptomics to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of beticolin 1 in Cercospora. It contains an anthraquinone moiety and an unusual halogenated xanthone moiety connected by a bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane. During elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, a novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 responsible for anthraquinone ring cleavage was discovered. More importantly, the discovery of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 is well supported by experimental evidence: (i)&#8197;crystal structure and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that its reactive site is built by an atypical iron ion coordination, where the iron ion is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water; (ii)&#8197;Kcx377 is mediated by His58 and Thr299 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Therefore, we believed this study updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties in Turbostratic Carbon for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations is fabricated by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid, which is directly applied for HO2&#8722; synthesis in alkaline media through an O2 reduction reaction. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a green route for decentralized H2O2 synthesis, where a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active two&#8208;electron pathway. Here, we report the fabrication of a boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations (CNB&#8208;ZIL) by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored B&#8722;N moiety in CNB&#8208;ZIL, where interfacial B&#8722;N species in a homogeneous distribution tend to segregate into hexagonal boron nitride domains at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on the experimental observations, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established. The CNB&#8208;ZIL electrocatalysts with optimal interfacial B&#8722;N moieties exhibit a high HO2&#8722; selectivity with small overpotentials in alkaline media, giving a HO2&#8722; yield of &#8776;1787&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective de novo Construction of Chiral Arenes through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization approach to centrally chiral unfunctionalized arenes is developed through the enantioselective de novo construction of the arene ring by oxidative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of polycyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenediones. Catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether, this external oxidant&#8208;free protocol gives rise to diversely substituted chiral arenes with outstanding enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.0&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.).







Abstract
Central chirality in arene derivatives arising out of unsymmetrically substituted arene ring is a fascinating yet rarely explored research topic. Here, we report a desymmetrization approach to centrally chiral unfunctionalized arenes, which is enabled by the enantioselective de novo construction of the arene ring. This operationally simple protocol is based on a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between polycyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenediones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, and doesn't usually require any external oxidant. Catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether, this reaction proceeds via dienamine intermediate and greatly simplifies the access to diversely substituted chiral arenes with outstanding enantioselectivities.

         <title>High&#8208;Field NMR, Reactivity, and DFT Modeling Reveal the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Surface Hydroxyl Network
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl network of gamma&#8208;Al2O3 was studied over a 300&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C dehydroxylation temperature range. High&#8208;field MAS NMR, IR and DFT were harnessed to provide an unprecedented qualitative and quantitative assessment of the AlOH network, with impact on understanding of alkane conversion catalysts.







Abstract
Aluminas are strategic materials used in many major industrial processes, either as catalyst supports or as catalysts in their own right. The transition alumina &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 is a privileged support, whose reactivity can be tuned by thermal activation. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 at three different dehydroxylation temperatures. The principal [AlOH] configurations are identified and described in unprecedented detail at the molecular level. The structures were established by combining information from high&#8208;field 1H and 27Al solid&#8208;state NMR, IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, as well as selective reactivity studies. Finally, the relationship between the hydroxyl structures and the molecular&#8208;level structures of the active sites in catalytic alkane metathesis is discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Aluminas are strategic materials used in many major industrial processes, either as catalyst supports or as catalysts in their own right. The transition alumina &#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a privileged support, whose reactivity can be tuned by thermal activation. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of &#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at three different dehydroxylation temperatures. The principal [AlOH] configurations are identified and described in unprecedented detail at the molecular level. The structures were established by combining information from high-field &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al solid-state NMR, IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, as well as selective reactivity studies. Finally, the relationship between the hydroxyl structures and the molecular-level structures of the active sites in catalytic alkane metathesis is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Coordination Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Capacity Ammonium Storage in Amorphous Manganese Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous manganese phosphate material is prepared using an electrochemical method for aqueous NH4+ ion storage. The electrode displays an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 299.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in NH4Ac electrolyte. Acetate ions can coordinate with the Mn sites and tailor the surface properties of the electrode, leading to the enhanced NH4+ adsorption capability.







Abstract
Ammonium (NH4+) ion as charge carrier is attracting attention in aqueous batteries. Yet, most NH4+ host materials are still limited by the relatively low capacities. Here, we fabricated a manganese phosphate (MP&#8208;20) for NH4+ ion storage. MP&#8208;20 displays a high capacity of 299.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte, outperforming other reported NH4+ host materials. Spectroscopy studies suggest a new NH4+/H+ co&#8208;insertion mechanism. We surprisingly discover that the NH4Ac electrolyte plays an important role in improving the charge storage capability of the materials. Experimental and computational results indicate acetate ions can form coordination bonds with the Mn atoms, tailoring the electronic structure of the Mn atoms and the surrounding O atoms, and therefore facilitating the NH4+ storage process. Our findings provide a new NH4+ host material and propose the important role of the electrolyte&#8208;electrode coordination effect in aqueous ammonium batteries.

         <title>From Ensemble Electrochemistry to Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry: Altered Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of LaNiO3 nanocube (NC)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) were systematically studied at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels. The selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, offering the scope of new catalytic approaches to be developed.







Abstract
Selective electrochemical production of valued chemicals is of significant importance but remains a great challenge in chemistry. Conventional approaches for enhancing reaction selectivity focus on the improvement of the catalysts themselves. In this work, we systematically studied the reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of LaNiO3 nanocubes (LaNiO3 NCs) catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry (NIE). We find that the selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, due to the significantly enhanced mass transport at single nanoparticles. This discovery offers the scope of new catalytic approaches for engineering electrochemical reactions in general.

A novel geminal N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline 1 degrades white phosphorus (P4) furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208; diphosphapyrrole 2. The latter further reacts readily with P4 and 1 to afford the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing species 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4 depending on the molar ratio of the reactants. Moreover, the products 3 and 4 can be converted into each other when treated with 1 and P4, respectively.







Abstract
White phosphorus (P4) undergoes degradation to P2 moieties if exposed to the new N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline PhNSi2 1 (Si=Si[N(tBu)]2CPh), furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole 2 and the two novel functionalized Si=P doubly bonded compounds 3 and 4. The pathways for the transformation of the non&#8208;aromatic 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole PhNSi2P2 2 into 3 and 4 could be uncovered. It became evident that 2 reacts readily with both reactants P4 and 1 to afford either the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing product [PhNSi2P2]2P2 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4, depending on the employed molar ratio of 1 and P4 as well as the reaction conditions. Compounds 3 and 4 can be converted into each other by reactions with 1 and P4, respectively. All new compounds 1&#8211;4 were unequivocally characterized including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In addition, the electronic structures of 2&#8211;4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

A highly robust bismuth MOF shows an unusual concerted structural response involving changes in inorganic building units upon binding of guest species at different sites. The MOF is an active catalyst for the Strecker reaction.







Abstract
Bismuth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as heterogeneous catalysts are scarce, and there is little knowledge on the influence of the MOF features on their resulting activity and behavior. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity in the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Strecker reaction with ketones of three new MOFs prepared with the combination of indium or bismuth and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid. One of them, denoted BiPF&#8208;7, is very robust and chemically stable, and demonstrates a high activity in the formation of the desired &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. The interaction of the catalytic substrates with the metal centers in this MOF has been crystallographically characterized, showcasing a concerted framework adaptability process that involves structural changes in framework components that are not directly involved in the binding of the guests.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as heterogeneous catalysts are scarce, and there is little knowledge on the influence of the MOF features on their resulting activity and behavior. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity in the one-pot multicomponent Strecker reaction with ketones of three new MOFs prepared with the combination of indium or bismuth and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-methanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid. One of them, denoted BiPF-7, is very robust and chemically stable, and demonstrates a high activity in the formation of the desired &#945;-aminonitriles. The interaction of the catalytic substrates with the metal centers in this MOF has been crystallographically characterized, showcasing a concerted framework adaptability process that involves structural changes in framework components that are not directly involved in the binding of the guests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Molybdenum&#8208;N3 Sites for Selective Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 to CO is reported over single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety. Density functional theory studies and experimental studies provide additional evidence to support the observed activity. A high and stable conversion of CO2 is attained up to 30.4&#8201;% with a 100&#8201;% CO selectivity.







Abstract
The design of efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is desired yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report that single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety enable remarkable CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation to CO, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by a high and stable conversion of CO2 reaching about 30.4&#8201;% with a CO selectivity of almost 100&#8201;% at 500&#8201;&#176;C and very low H2 partial pressure. Atomically dispersed MoN3 is calculated to facilitate CO2 activation and reduces CO2 to CO* via the direct dissociation path. Furthermore, the highest transition state energy in CO formation is 0.82&#8197;eV, which is substantially lower than that of CH4 formation (2.16&#8197;eV) and accounts for the dominant yield of CO. The enhanced catalytic performances of Mo/NC originate from facile CO desorption with the help of dispersed Mo on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Mo/NC), and in the absence of Mo nanoparticles. The resulting catalyst preserves good stability without degradation of CO2 conversion rate even after 68&#8197;hours of continuous reaction. This finding provides a promising route for the construction of highly active, selective, and robust single&#8208;atom non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

         <title>Deep Learning for Additive Screening in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive engineering has significantly improved the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices, and is promising for further enhancing perovskite devices&#8217; efficiency. A key challenge is to choose suitable additive for perovskite. The approach based on deep learning helps to predict the suitable additives, giving rising to high&#8208;performance near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Additive engineering with organic molecules is of critical importance for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronic devices. However, experimentally finding suitable additives is costly and time consuming, while conventional machine learning (ML) is difficult to predict accurately due to the limited experimental data available in this relatively new field. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning method that can predict the effectiveness of additives in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with a high accuracy up to 96&#8201;% by using a small dataset of 132 molecules. This model can maximize the information of the molecules and significantly mitigate the duplicated problem that usually happened with previous models in ML for molecular screening. Very high efficiency PeLEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency up to 22.7&#8201;% can be achieved by using the predicated additive. Our work opens a new avenue for further boosting the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Promoted by a Ru1Cu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) was achieved over a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires. Single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF to afford DHMF. This work offers a catalyst design model for highly efficient ECH of biomass via single&#8208;atom alloying.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents an elegant route toward sustainable value&#8208;added chemicals production that circumvents the use of fossil fuel and hydrogen. However, the reaction efficiency is hampered by the high voltage and low activity of electrodes (Cu, Bi, Pb). Herein, we report a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires that exhibits an electrochemical reduction of HMF to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with promoted productivity (0.47 vs. 0.08&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and faradic efficiency (FE) (85.6 vs. 71.3&#8201;%) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V (vs. RHE) compared with Cu counterpart. More importantly, the FE (87.5&#8201;%) is largely retained at high HMF concentration (100&#8197;mM). Kinetic studies by using combined electrochemical techniques suggest disparate mechanisms over Ru1Cu and Cu, revealing that single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF via an electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) mechanism.

         <title>Linker Scissoring Strategy Enables Precise Shaping of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Chromatographic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;linker scissoring&#8221; strategy is used to control the shape of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles from nanoplate to nanorod by surface conformational pairing. Both structure and shape influenced the separation ability of MOF stationary phases in gas chromatography by affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic diffusion factors.







Abstract
Precise shaping of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is significant in both fundamental coordination chemistry and practical applications, such as catalysis, separation, and biomedicine. Herein, we demonstrated a linker scissoring strategy for precisely shaping MOFs through surface conformational pairing. In this strategy, the bidentate linkers which were designed according to the original tetratopic ligands and the coordination environment of MOF surfaces, were utilized as the covering agents. The shape of these covering agents and the surface conformation of metals onto MOFs restricted them to coordinate on specific MOF facets thus precisely controlling the shape of the MOFs. Different shapes of PCN&#8208;608 from nanoplate (PCN&#8208;NP) to nanorod (PCN&#8208;NR) have been targeted by adding different bidentate linkers. The universality of this strategy was demonstrated by controlling the shapes of the NU&#8208;MOFs from nanoplate to nanorod. This strategy provides a new guiding principle to synthesize MOF nanocrystals with controlled shapes.

Activated graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 catalysts showed a remarkable nitrogen fixation apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% under 365&#8197;nm light and high stability as solar nitrogen fertilizer. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and forms effective active sites. Graphene embedding controlled bond breakages and improved photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Currently, nitrogen fertilizers feed half of the global population, but their use is limited by energy consumption and transportation. Therefore, it is important to study photocatalysts for use in solar nitrogen fertilizers. Herein, a new type of graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 (Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) photocatalyst (GSCe) is investigated. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and the formation of active sites by ultraviolet light in water. Moreover, embedding graphene effectively controls activation and improves nitrogen fixation. GSCe exhibited a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% and stability under 365&#8197;nm light with solar&#8208;level intensity. GSCe also performed well as a solar ammonia fertilizer for crop cultivation. This investigation opens up opportunities for nitrogen fixation photocatalysts to be used as environmentally friendly solar nitrogen fertilizers.

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MG8, a novel polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome, with robust PET degradation activity, was discovered and characterized. It was further repurposed into a covalent binder of PET through genetic code expansion, enabling its use to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report a bioinformatic workflow and subsequent discovery of a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase, which we named MG8, from the human saliva metagenome. MG8 has robust PET plastic degradation activities under different temperature and salinity conditions, outperforming several naturally occurring and engineered hydrolases in degrading PET. Moreover, we genetically encoded 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP) in place of the catalytic serine residue of MG8, thereby converting a PET hydrolase into a covalent binder for bio&#8208;functionalization of PET. We show that MG8(DAP), in conjunction with a split green fluorescent protein system, can be used to attach protein cargos to PET as well as other polyester plastics. The discovery of a highly active PET hydrolase from the human metagenome&#8212;currently an underexplored resource for industrial enzyme discovery&#8212;as well as the repurposing of such an enzyme into a plastic functionalization tool, should facilitate ongoing efforts to degrade and maximize reusability of PET.

         <title>Scalable, Chemoselective Nickel Electrocatalytic Sulfinylation of Aryl Halides with SO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by electrochemistry, the conversion of aryl halides to sulfinates using an inexpensive Ni catalyst at room temperature is reported. The use of SO2 stock solution at controlled concentration represents a convenient sulfur source. The sulfinate intermediates can be derivatized into sulfonyl fluorides, sulfonamide, and sulfone in a one&#8208;pot fashion. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up in batch and flow.







Abstract
Simple access to aryl sulfinates from aryl iodides and bromides is reported using an inexpensive Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic protocol. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, uses stock solution of simple SO2 as sulfur source, and can be scaled up in batch and recycle flow settings. The limitations of this reaction are clearly shown and put into context by benchmarking with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based methods.

         <title>Organic Sulfonium&#8208;Stabilized High&#8208;Efficiency Cesium or Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic sulfonium bromide was introduced as a new X&#8208;type ligand to synthesize cesium or methylammonium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). The purified PNCs exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) without post&#8208;treatments and showed high ambient stability. The CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene, and the composite exhibited a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new X&#8208;type ligand, i.e., organic sulfonium bromide, for high&#8208;efficiency CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). We first confirmed the facile synthesis of the titled ligands in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at room temperature. By reacting dodecylmethylsulfide with allyl bromide, (3&#8208;bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane, and 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane, respectively, three representative ligands (named DAM, DSM, and DMM) are acquired. All of them result in CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 PNCs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and decent ambient stability (no less than 90&#8201;% PLQY after 2&#8197;months) using a room&#8208;temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation technique. Among them, DSM and DMM endow CsPbBr3 PNCs with higher thermal/light stability arising from the cross&#8208;linkable or bidentate ligand structure. Further, DSM&#8208;CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene through in situ thermal polymerization and the composite shows a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8&#8201;%.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultra&#8208;Microporosity for Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation at High Temperature and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;microporous zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is used for CO2 capture over C2H2 to obtain highly pure C2H2 directly. The material not only shows high separation performance at low temperatures but also at high temperatures and humidities.







Abstract
Separation of CO2/C2H2 to obtain pure C2H2 presents a challenge for the chemical industry. CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents are favored because of the convenient separation process. However, there are only a few CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO2 from CO2/C2H2, and there is almost no research on CO2/C2H2 separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO2/C2H2 at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO2 with almost no C2H2 taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO2/C2H2, and highly pure C2H2 is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333&#8197;K with 18.12&#8201;% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.

However, there are only a few CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and there is almost no research on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;-Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with almost no C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and highly pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333&#8197;K with 18.12&#8201;% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chromophore&#8208;Inspired Design of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polymers for Dual Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal photoredox platform was developed through the synergistic construction of triphenylpyrylium&#8208;mimic ligands and reductive metal ions in a metal&#8211;organic polymer. This novel strategy enabled the integration of significant photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) events for the efficient photocatalysis of various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation. PYTC+=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium.







Abstract
2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyrylium (TPT+) functions as a classic organic photocatalyst and exhibits a noteworthy absorption in the visible range, strongly oxidizing excited states, and a somewhat unstable structure. Inspired by the nuclear chromophore and dual catalysis strategy, herein, we report a universal photoredox platform constructed by TPT+&#8208;mimic bridging ligands and reductive metal ions on the basis of metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems for various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Significant photoinduced electron transfer and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer events are both integrated and regulated by the spatial and kinetic confinement effects of the structurally confined microenvironments, effectively improving the efficiency of electron transfer and radical&#8211;radical coupling processes in photocatalysis. This package deal provides a promising way for the design of novel photocatalysts and the development of versatile and sustainable synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Bonding Oxidation Group and Titanium Cluster to Synthesize a Porous Crystalline Catalyst for Selective Photo&#8208;Oxidation Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium&#8208;cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been prepared through the covalent&#8208;coupling between the Ti&#8208;cluster and an oxidation group. The resulting nanosheets can be applied for highly selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass HMF into FDCA.







Abstract
The selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is important due to its substitute&#8208;role in polyester&#8208;fabrication. Here, a titanium&#8208;cluster based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling between Ti6&#8208;NH2 and benzotrithiophene tricarbaldehyde (BTT). The integration of them endows the nanosheet with a visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and suitable photo&#8208;oxidation ability. Specifically, its photo&#8208;selectivity for HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA can be &gt;95&#8201;% with &#8776;100&#8201;% conversion, which is more than 2, 5, and 10 times higher than MOF&#8208;901 (43&#8201;%), Ti6&#8208;NH2 (19&#8201;%) and under&#8208;darkness (9&#8201;%), respectively. Notably, an O2&#8208;based mechanism is proposed and the vital roles of Ti6&#8208;NH2 and BTT are verified by DFT calculations. This work might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline&#8208;catalysts for selective biomass&#8208;valorization.

         <title>Dual Cooperatively Grown J&#8208;aggregates with Different Nucleus Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular aggregation system is studied in which the two J&#8208;aggregates are both assembled cooperatively. A series of variable&#8208;temperature experiments indicate that the different nucleus sizes of J1 and J2 account for the difference in their elongation temperatures. Despite the thermodynamic stability of J2 at around room temperature, the smaller nucleus size and higher elongation temperature facilitate the J1 formation from thermal treatment.







Abstract
A molecule featuring two distinct cooperatively grown J&#8208;aggregates is investigated. Interestingly, when cooling a hot monomer solution, the thermodynamically less stable J1 is exclusively formed even at a particularly slowed temperature dropping rate, which transforms to the more stable J2 at room temperature with very slow kinetics. This observation is ascribed to the differed nucleus sizes of J1 and J2. During the cooling process, smaller J1 nuclei are formed first at a higher temperature, favored by the entropy effect. At intermediate temperatures, the elongation of J1 out&#8208;competes the nucleation of J2. Then, below the elongation temperature of J2, the formation of this thermodynamically stable aggregate is hindered kinetically, due to the depletion of monomer by the slow dissociation of J1. Additional evidence proving the larger nucleus size of J2 is also identified with the varied&#8208;temperature spectral analyses and mathematic simulations.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Supramolecule via Hydrogen Bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking for Ultrahigh Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust two&#8208;dimensional organic supramolecular network is achieved via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility and rapid ion transport channels for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge Zn&#8211;organic batteries with record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh capacity and outstanding cyclability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, the reported electrode materials for ZIBs are facing shortcomings including low capacity and unsatisfactory cycling stability etc. Herein, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;quione (HATNQ) is reported for aqueous ZIBs. The HATNQ electrodes delivered an ultrahigh capacity (482.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability of &gt;10&#8201;000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The capacity sets a new record for organic cathodes in aqueous ZIBs. The high performances are ascribed to the rich C=O and C=N groups that endowed HATNQ with a 2D layered supramolecular structure by multiple hydrogen bonds in plane with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility, and rapid ion transport for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge batteries. Moreover, the 2D supramolecular structure boosted the storage of Zn2+/H+, particularly the storage of Zn2+, due to the more favorable O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N coordination in HATNQ.

The capacity sets a new record for organic cathodes in aqueous ZIBs. The high performances are ascribed to the rich C=O and C=N groups that endowed HATNQ with a 2D layered supramolecular structure by multiple hydrogen bonds in plane with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions out-of-plane, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility, and rapid ion transport for fast-charge and -discharge batteries. Moreover, the 2D supramolecular structure boosted the storage of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, particularly the storage of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, due to the more favorable O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N coordination in HATNQ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bioremediation. The discovery of MG8, an efficient polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase enzyme from the human saliva metagenome, is reported by Worawan Bhanthumnavin, Chayasith Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202203061). Aside from its plastic degradation capability, MG8 was further engineered via genetic code expansion into a covalent binder of PET plastic and can be used to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters.

The site&#8208;selective functionalization of carboranes with multiple B&#8722;H sites is a long&#8208;standing challenge. In their Research Article (e202205672), Deshuang Tu, Changsheng Lu, Hong Yan, and co&#8208;workers developed an efficient reaction protocol for the selective alkylation, alkenylation, and heteroarylation of carboranes under mild conditions via boron&#8208;vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals generated by photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of boron&#8208;substituted carborane carboxylic acids.

         <title>Radical Brook Rearrangements: Concept and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical Brook rearrangement is a unique molecular arrangement, but it is not highly explored in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of radical Brook rearrangements and highlights the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements.







Abstract
The Brook rearrangement has already become established as one of the most important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and has been applied in the generation of complexes, drug discovery, material science, and natural products synthesis. Compared to the widely known ionic mechanism, the radical Brook rearrangement is less explored because of the difficulty in generating alkoxyl radical species. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of the radical Brook rearrangement and highlights recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements. We hope this survey will inspire further developments in this emerging area.

         <title>Capture, Storage, and Release of Oxygen by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging materials for oxygen capture and storage with significant benefits for the broader community. This Minireview assesses and discusses the fundamental chemistry for both selective and reversible MOFs for the role of oxygen capture from air. In addition, we describe the current state of play for oxygen storage by MOFs, as well as engineering solutions to aid in the release of oxygen once captured.







Abstract
Oxygen is a critical gas for medical and industrial settings. Much of today's global oxygen supply is via inefficient technologies such as cryogenic distillation, membranes or zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promise a superior alternative for oxygen separation, as their fundamental chemistry can in principle be tailored for reversible and selective oxygen capture. We evaluate the characteristics for reversible and selective uptake of oxygen by MOFs, focussing on redox&#8208;active sites. Key characteristics for separation can also be seen in MOFs for oxygen storage roles. Engineering solutions to release adsorbed oxygen from the MOFs are discussed including Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and the highly efficient Magnetic Induction Swing Adsorption (MISA). We conclude with the applications and outlooks for oxygen capture, storage and release, and the likely impacts the next generation of MOFs will have on industry and the broader community.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology with many unique advantages. This Minireview highlights the recent advances in material design and cutting&#8208;edge devices. Particular attention is paid to a few research directions toward practical applications of OSCs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant progress in recent years. Innovations in material design and device optimization have improved the power conversion efficiencies to over 19&#8201;%. In this Minireview, based on recent advances, we discuss molecular design strategies to tune the absorption spectrum, energy level, and intermolecular aggregation as well as highlight the role of molecular electrostatic potential in decreasing energy loss. Then, we introduce the latest progress in four types of OSCs composed of different donor:acceptor combinations: polymer donor:small&#8208;molecule acceptor, all&#8208;polymer, all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule, and small&#8208;molecule donor:polymer acceptor. Finally, the challenges of OSCs in practical applications, including material cost, stability, and multi&#8208;function integration, are discussed.

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Chemistry with Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Fad or the Future?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) continue to generate interest within and beyond the chemistry community. Their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions for sustainable chemistry. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) debuted with a promise of a superior sustainability footprint due to their low vapor pressure. However, their toxicity and high cost compromise this footprint, impeding their real&#8208;world applications. Fortunately, their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.

         <title>Fused Hybrids of a [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complex with a NiII Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly fused porphyrinoids with wavy structures have been synthesized by the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 complexes with NiII porphyrins and a subsequent oxidative fusion reaction with FeCl3. The fused hybrids with cycloheptatriene linkages exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced absorption bands in the near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
[22]Smaragdyrin BF2 complex (S)&#8208;NiII porphyrin (P) fused hybrids were synthesized through Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of brominated S with borylated P and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction with FeCl3 as the first example of directly fused porphyrinoids bearing cycloheptatriene linkage. These fused hybrids have been fully characterized, including their X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Owing to the cycloheptatriene linkage, these fused hybrids adopt waving structures. These fused hybrids display red&#8208;shifted and enhanced Q&#8208;like bands and characteristic redox potentials, depending upon the constitution and the linking position.

         <title>Stable Monodisperse Pb1&#8722;xCdxS Quantum Dots for NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging by Aqueous Coprecipitation of Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly monodisperse and stable Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs are prepared by a simple aqueous method with Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 clusters as building blocks. They emit at 1100&#8197;nm in the NIR&#8208;II window with 17.72&#8201;% PLQY in water. Fine lymphography, angiography and dual&#8208;channel bioimaging at low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) excitation can be successfully achieved by using these ternary QDs. The excellent stability makes this material very competitive in practical applications.







Abstract
Aqueous lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized by traditional methods are unstable, so that they are usually coated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) to prevent oxidation, which are complicated and not satisfactory for mass production. Here, stable ternary Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs were synthesized by in situ coprecipitation of Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 bimetallic clusters in an aqueous solution, which possess a uniform size of 4.0&#177;0.2&#8197;nm and the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission at 1100&#8197;nm with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 17.72&#8201;%. Stored at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in colloidal form, the PLQY of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs remained at 90.9&#8201;% of the initial value after 15&#8197;days, while stored as powder, the spectra did not change after 5&#8197;months. The high PLQY and good water compatibility of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs provide a good performance in vivo vasculature imaging and lymphatic system imaging at a very low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Multienzyme Redox System with Cofactor Regeneration for Cyclic Deracemization of Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multienzyme cyclic deracemization system with cofactor regeneration was established for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. Chiral sulfoxides were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% yield with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), styrene monooxygenase (SMO), and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).







Abstract
Optically pure sulfoxides are noteworthy compounds applied in a wide range of industrial fields; however, the biocatalytic deracemization of racemic sulfoxides is challenging. Herein, a high&#8208;enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) was combined with a low&#8208;enantioselective styrene monooxygenase (SMO) for the cyclic deracemization of sulfoxides. Enantiopure sulfoxides were obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% yield and with &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee) through dynamic &#8220;selective reduction and non&#8208;selective oxidation&#8221; cycles. The cofactors of MsrA and SMO were subsequently regenerated by the cascade catalysis of three auxiliary enzymes through the consumption of low&#8208;cost D&#8208;glucose. Moreover, this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step&#8221; cyclic deracemization strategy exhibited a wide substrate scope toward various aromatic, heteroaromatic, alkyl and thio&#8208;alkyl sulfoxides. This system proposed an efficient strategy for the green synthesis of chiral sulfoxide.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Iodonium Reagent via Dyotropic Rearrangement and Its Utilization in Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel hypervalent iodonium salt was developed with the exploitation of a dyotropic rearrangement of iodine and chlorine functions in fluoroalkyl chains from HFO&#8208;1234yf gas. The electrophilic reagent enabled the direct and metal&#8208;free introduction of a special fluoroalkyl group into aniline derivatives and N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic compounds. Detailed experimental and computational data were collected and used to propose a mechanistic description of this unique rearrangement.







Abstract
[1,2]&#8208;shift of atoms in alkyl fragments belongs to the class of dyotropic rearrangements. Various atoms, including halogens can be involved in the migration, however participation of iodine is unprecedented. Herein, we report our experimental and DFT studies on the oxidation triggered dyotropic rearrangement of iodo and chloro functions via butterfly&#8208;type transition state to demonstrate the migrating ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodane centre. With the exploitation of dyotropic rearrangement we designed and synthesized a novel fluoroalkyl iodonium reagent from industrial feedstock gas HFO&#8208;1234yf. We demonstrated that the hypervalent reagent serves as an excellent fluoroalkylation agent for various amines and nitrogen heterocycles.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Supported Perfluororhodacyclopentanes: High Nucleophilicity of the M&#8722;CF Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by a PBP&#8208;pincer ligand was synthesized. The Rh&#8722;CF bond showed high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis thanks to the strong &#963;&#8208;donation from the boryl group.







Abstract
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by PBP pincer ligand PBP&#8208;RhIII(CF2)4 (2) was prepared from PBP&#8208;RhI&#8208;PPh3 (1) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). By scXRD analysis, it was revealed that the Rh&#8722;CF bond trans to the boryl ligand was largely elongated compared to the one in the apical position.

&lt;p&gt;Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by a PBP-pincer ligand was synthesized. The Rh&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; bond showed high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis thanks to the strong &#963;-donation from the boryl group.

&lt;p&gt;Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by PBP pincer ligand PBP-Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) was prepared from PBP-Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). By scXRD analysis, it was revealed that the Rh&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; bond trans to the boryl ligand was largely elongated compared to the one in the apical position.

         <title>Periphery&#8208;Core Strategy to Access a Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecule Bearing Multiple Heteroatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bowl&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with up to four sulfur atoms and two embedded B&#8722;N bonds has been synthesized by a periphery&#8208;core strategy, whereby the bottom of the bowl is closed in the final step. The incorporation of sulfur and nitrogen atoms enriches the electronic density of the buckybowl and results in a strong intermolecular interaction with C60 fullerene.







Abstract
Most of the bowl&#8208;shaped molecules are synthesized via a core&#8208;periphery strategy with the bowl rim closed at the final stage. However, the construction of heteroatom&#8208;doped buckybowls by the periphery&#8208;core method with the bowl bottom sealed by inserting new atoms in the last step is quite limited. Herein we report the synthesis of a bowl&#8208;shaped compound containing four sulfur atoms and two embedded N&#8722;B bonds with the ratio of carbon atom and heteroatom as low as four through a periphery&#8208;core strategy. Crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of a bowl&#8208;shaped structure. The multiple heteroatoms alter the molecular electronic structure, thus resulting in the distinct aromaticity when compared with its all&#8208;carbon congener. The electron&#8208;rich buckybowl shows a strong interaction with the electron&#8208;deficient fullerene C60 by forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex in toluene.

A CuI&#8208;phosphine catalytic system activates 1,1&#8208;diborylalkenes stereoselectively. The energetically preferred formation of (Z)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;borylalkenyl copper(I) species and the subsequent coupling reaction with allyl bromides allow the exclusive formation of (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes. This new methodology is applicable to various 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolboryl)alkenes which can be efficiently coupled with different types of allyl halides. The (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes with bromide functionality are treated with NaOtBu to promote cyclization/aromatization patterns via enyne intermediates.

         <title>Topochemical Cycloaddition Reaction between an Azide and an Internal Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes are generally unreactive in solution&#8208;phase 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. However, a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction involving an internal alkyne has now been achieved by using a cyclitol&#8208;derived monomer containing an azide and an internal alkyne group. Heating the crystals results in the monomer undergoing a topochemical polymerization to yield trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked&#8208;polycyclitol.







Abstract
Here we report the synthesis of a trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymer using a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. A cyclitol&#8208;derived monomer having an azide and an internal alkyne group was designed. The four hydroxy groups present in this monomer dictate its crystal packing such that the monomer molecules are arranged head&#8208;to&#8208;tail, thereby placing the internal alkyne and the azide units of adjacent molecules proximally. Although the alignment of the reactive groups in the monomer crystal is not favourable for a topochemical reaction, a reactive orientation can be achieved by the rotation of the reactive groups. Upon heating the crystals, the monomer underwent topochemical polymerization to yield the trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked&#8208;polycyclitol. This study demonstrates a new synthetic strategy for cycloaddition reaction between non&#8208;polarized internal alkynes and azides to yield trisubstituted triazoles.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange as a Route for Endosomal Escape of Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric nanogels with judiciously placed disulfide bonds have been synthesized and tested for cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Comparison with their non&#8208;disulfide counterparts shows that disulfide moieties play a key role in endosomal escape.







Abstract
Endosomal entrapment has remained the major bottleneck for cytosolic delivery of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems. Uncovering fundamentally new pathways for endosomal escape is therefore highly sought. Herein, we report that disulfide bonds can enhance endosomal escape through contacts with cellular exofacial thiols, in addition to facilitating cellular uptake. Our results are supported through comparative analysis of polymeric nanogels with variable accessibility to disulfide bonds by placing these functionalities at the core or the shell of the nanogels. The findings here inform future chemical design of delivery vehicles.

A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne.







Abstract
A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne. The synthesis of allylic boronate esters can be accomplished in the presence of a wide range of functional groups, including, esters, nitriles, alkyl halides, sulfonyl esters, acetals, protected terminal alkynes, aryl halides, and silyl ethers. Mechanistic experiments reveal the importance of subtle ligand effects on the performance of the palladium co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence from Chiral Perovskite Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral perovskite scintillators emit circularly polarized radioluminescence with a controlled propagation pathway, enabling a new style of X&#8208;ray imaging, which potentially reduces the optical crosstalk.







Abstract
Scintillators display radioluminescent properties when irradiated by high&#8208;energy photons and therefore play an essential role in radiation detection. The current inventory of scintillators is overwhelmingly represented by achiral structures, where the radioluminescence propagates isotropically after generation. Herein, we demonstrate that chiral perovskites of (R&#8208;3AP)PbBr3Cl&#8901;H2O (R&#8208;3APP) and (S&#8208;3AP)PbBr3Cl&#8901;H2O (S&#8208;3APP) emerge as a new type of scintillator displaying a distinct property of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL). A high quantum yield of 27.6&#8201;%, high luminescence dissymmetric factors (glum) of 4&#215;10&#8722;2, and high X&#8208;ray absorption coefficients were observed for these compounds. As proof of concept, we fabricated a polarized scintillator pair by assembling chiral scintillator crystals, which provides a new strategy to attenuate optical crosstalk between the scintillators by precisely controlling the radioluminescence propagation and improves the X&#8208;ray imaging quality at the boundary region.

         <title>Giant Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption by Heptazine Organometalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic donors covalently attached to an s&#8208;heptazine acceptor afford photo&#8208;stable materials that possess outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections in the technologically important near&#8208;infrared III region of the spectrum, and exceptional four&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections in the recently proposed 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm window.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) is of increasing interest for applications in technologically important &#8220;windows&#8221; of the electromagnetic spectrum (near&#8208;infrared III, NIR&#8208;III, 1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm; and the new 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm region); however, few molecules exist that display strong MPA at these long wavelengths. We herein report the syntheses of the first 2,5,8&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine&#8208;cored organometallic complexes, together with organic analogues. The complexes exhibit outstanding 3PA cross&#8208;sections in the NIR&#8208;III and exceptional 4PA cross&#8208;sections in the new 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm window. We demonstrate that replacing organic donor groups by organometallic units results in an order of magnitude increase in 3PA, the &#8220;switching on&#8221; of 4PA, and a dramatic improvement in photo&#8208;stability. Our results highlight the impressive outcomes possible with an &#8220;organometalation&#8221; approach to NLO materials design.

         <title>Desymmetric Cyanosilylation of Acyclic 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bifunctional complex containing both a hydrogen bond donor and a Lewis acidic magnesium center was discovered to be a stereoselective cyanosilylation catalyst for structurally flexible acyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones. Stereochemically defined vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereocenters can be obtained and further derived to polyfunctionalized molecules.







Abstract
Diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal stereocenters from easily available starting materials is a challenging task. Here, we report that a bifunctional catalyst prepared from dibutylmagnesium and a pipecolinol&#8208;derived tetradentate ligand can enable an asymmetric cyanosilylation of 1,3&#8208;diketones to forge a pair of neighboring and acyclic tetrasubstituted carbons. The high stereoselectivity results from the rigid conformation of the diketone in the catalyst pocket, where the Lewis acidic magnesium center, together with the free hydroxyl group as a putative hydrogen bond donor, bind with both carbonyls. Consequently, stereochemically well&#8208;defined cyanohydrin silyl ethers with a diverse collection of substituents were prepared. Their rapid derivatization to molecules of higher complexity, such as heterocycles, triols, and fused rings, were also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a silyliumylidene cation complex stabilized by a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand is reported. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the highly electrophilic SiII center is stabilized by a dative Ni&#8594;Si &#963;&#8208;interaction and &#960;&#8208;donations from the amino&#8208; and Ni&#8208;moieties. Due to the energetically close frontier orbitals localized on Si and Ni atoms, this silyliumylidene complex presents competitive reactivity at Si and Ni sites.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial alkaloids from Bipolaris Fungi represent notable challenges to the field of chemical synthesis owing to their reactive, electron&#8208;rich bispyrrole architectures. Herein we explore the chemical reactivity of this unusual alkaloid framework resulting in the total synthesis of bipolamines D, E, G, and I and a discussion surrounding possible biosynthetic relationships within this family.







Abstract
indolizidine alkaloids of unusual biosynthetic origin have recently been characterized from several species of fungi within the Pleosporaceae family. Possessing distinct polycyclic architectures with two embedded electron&#8208;rich pyrroles as well as reported antibacterial activity against gram positive and negative pathogens, these natural products represent attractive targets for total synthesis. Herein we survey the differential functionalization of a chemically sensitive bispyrrole framework resulting in the preparation of multiple bipolamine alkaloids, work which sheds light on their innate chemical reactivity and potential biosynthetic relationships.

         <title>On the Bonding Nature in the Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Core&#8208;Shell Syngenetic &#963;&#8208;Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the chemical bond in a stable crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster. It involves a 3c&#8211;2e Th3 core bond and a multicenter (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. The resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies from the BLW method further confirm that this novel 3c&#8211;2e Th3 core bond is delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.







Abstract
A unique thorium&#8208;thorium bond was observed in the crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster [{Th(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2}3{K(THF)2}2]&#8734;, though the claim of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity for Th3 bond has been questioned. Herein, a new type of core&#8211;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the stability of this tri&#8208;thorium cluster. The model involves a 3c&#8211;2e bond in the Th3 core and a multicentered (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. To differentiate the strengths of the 3c&#8211;2e bond and the charge&#8208;shift bond, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method which falls into the ab initio valence bond (VB) theory is employed to construct a strictly core/shell localized state and its contributing covalent resonance structure for the Th3 core bond. By comparing with the &#963;&#8208;aromatic H3+ and nonaromatic Li3+, the computed resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies confirm that this Th3 core bond is truly delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative Cyclization Enabled by Asymmetric Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;ligand cooperation permits catalytic enantioselective dearomatization of 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. This work is facilitated by the development of a divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligands. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are realized. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative nature of the catalysis and the observed stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dearomatization is achieved via metal&#8208;chiral ligand cooperation. A new and divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphines is developed to allow rapid access to these ligands, which in turn facilitate the application of this chemistry to a broad substrate scope including 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are achieved via selective acceleration of one enantiomer formation enabled by hydrogen bonding between substrate and ligand remote basic group. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative catalysis and substantiate the reaction stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>Piezochromic Tetracoordinate Boron Complex: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetracoordinate boron complex shows polymorphism&#8208;dependent luminescence. Impressively, Y&#8208;phase crystals showed rare piezochromic luminescent properties: pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission. This phenomenon is due to a cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and changes in the charge&#8208;transfer behavior during compression.







Abstract
Achieving blueshifted and enhanced emission from purely organic luminophors remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a tetracoordinate boron complex with polymorphism (Y&#8208;phase and O&#8208;phase)&#8208;dependent luminescence. Impressively, the Y&#8208;phase crystals exhibited rare piezochromic luminescent properties such as pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission. The results of theoretical and experimental tests demonstrated that this phenomenon results from the cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and alterable charge transfer (CT) behavior during compression. This work provides an ideal model to investigate the optoelectronic properties of boron complexes. Importantly, manipulating the CT behavior through the electrophilicity of boron atoms may become a new principle for the design of piezochromic materials with blueshifted and enhanced emission.

         <title>Multifunctional Charge and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Effects of Second&#8208;Sphere Imidazolium Pendants Promote Capture and Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Water Catalyzed by Iron Porphyrins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants enable the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from through&#8208;space charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Charge effects are the dominant contributor to observed improvements in CO2 conversion with hydrogen bonding effects augmenting CO2 capture affinity, resulting in effective homogeneous electrocatalytic CO2RR in water.







Abstract
Microenvironments tailored by multifunctional secondary coordination sphere groups can enhance catalytic performance at primary metal active sites in natural systems. Here, we capture this biological concept in synthetic systems by developing a family of iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which promotes multiple synergistic effects to enhance CO2RR and enables the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from each type of interaction. Fe&#8208;ortho&#8208;im(H), which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO2 binding affinity by 25&#8208;fold and CO2RR activity by 2000&#8208;fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe&#8208;TPP). Comparison with monofunctional analogs reveals that through&#8208;space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO2RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.

         <title>Facile Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids into &#945;&#8208;Amino Phosphonates by Decarboxylative Phosphorylation using Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile conversion of &#945;&#8208;amino acids to the respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates via their redox active esters using organophotoredox catalysis is reported. A novel photocatalytic phosphorylation combines radical&#8211;polar crossover with Arbuzov&#8208;type reactivity, providing an operationally simple, high yielding and general synthetic approach for the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates.







Abstract
Amino phosphonates exhibit potent inhibitory activity for a wide range of biological processes due to their specific structural and electronic properties, making them important in a plethora of applications, including as enzyme inhibitors, herbicides, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents. While the traditional synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates has relied on the multicomponent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction, we herein describe a novel and facile conversion of activated derivatives of &#945;&#8208;amino acids directly to their respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonate counterparts via a decarboxylative radical&#8211;polar crossover process enabled by the use of visible&#8208;light organophotocatalysis. The novel method shows broad applicability across a range of natural and synthetic amino acids, operates under mild conditions, and has been demonstrated to successfully achieve the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a M&#246;bius Helicene Carbon Nanohoop
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#246;bius helicene nanohoop: A chiral helicene carbon nanohoop with M&#246;bius topology is obtained by integrating stereogenic [6]helicene unit with a planar &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation into radially&#8208;conjugated [7]cycloparaphenylene. The new carbon nanohoop preserves the favorable optoelectronic properties typical for cycloparaphenylenes while [6]helicene endows it with configurational stability and chiroptical properties, such as circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We present the first helicene carbon nanoohop that integrates a [6]helicene into [7]cycloparaphenylene. The [6]helicene endows the helicene carbon nanohoop with chiroptical properties and configurational stability typical for higher helicenes, while the radially conjugated seven para&#8208;phenylenes largely determine the optoelectronic properties. The structure of the helicene carbon nanoohop was unambiguously characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray analysis that revealed that it possesses a topology of a M&#246;bius strip in the solid state and in solution. The chirality transfers from the [6]helicene to the para&#8208;phenylenes and leads to a pronounced circular dichroism and bright circularly polarized luminescence, which is affected by the structural topology of the nanohoop.

         <title>Reactions of Frustrated Lewis Pairs with Chloro&#8208;Diazirines: Cleavage of N=N Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes are known to lead to rapid loss of N2, reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines prompt N=N double bond cleavage, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R3PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C6F5)2. A detailed DFT mechanistic study shows that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond.







Abstract
The reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes leads to the rapid loss of N2. In contrast, in this work, we reported reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines which led to the reduction of the N=N double bond, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R3PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C6F5)2. A detailed DFT mechanistic study showed that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond, followed by subsequent group transfer reactions to nitrogen and capture of the halide anion.

         <title>3D Printed CO2&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers and Post&#8208;Printing Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable CO2&#8208;based triblock polycarbonates with tailored thermal and mechanical properties were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy. By dispersing NaCl particles in polymer solutions, thixotropic inks can be formulated and 3D printed. Subsequent removal of the filler yields porous structures. The alkene pendant groups on the polymer backbone can be further modified via UV&#8208; induced thiol&#8208;ene surface functionalization and crosslinking.







Abstract
We report the facile synthesis and 3D printing of a series of triblock copolymers consisting of soft and hard blocks and demonstrate that alkene pendant groups of the hard block can be covalently modified. The polymers are prepared using a salenCo(III)TFA/PPNTFA binary catalyst system and 1,2&#8208;propanediol as a chain transfer agent, providing an efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy to tailor polymer thermal and mechanical properties. Thixotropic inks suitable for direct ink write printing were formulated by dissolving the block copolymers in organic solvent and dispersing NaCl particles. After printing, porous structures were produced by removing solvent and NaCl with water to give printed structures with surfaces that could be modified via UV&#8208;initiated thiol&#8208;ene click reactions. Alternatively, a tetra&#8208;thiol could be incorporated into the ink and used for cross&#8208;linking to give objects with high solvent resistance and selective degradability.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Encoded Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassay with Tunable Detection Range for COVID&#8208;19 Serum Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed strategy for chip&#8208;based sandwich immunoassays integrated with color/size dual&#8208;barcoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) is presented. RCA based on beads of various sizes allows for a tunable detection range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1.







Abstract
Serological assay for coronavirus 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) patients including asymptomatic cases can inform on disease progression and prognosis. A detection method taking into account multiplex, high sensitivity, and a wider detection range will help to identify and treat COVID&#8208;19. Here we integrated color&#8208;size dual&#8208;encoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) into a bead&#8208;based fluorescence immunoassay implemented in a size sorting chip to achieve high&#8208;throughput and sensitive detection. We used the assay for quantifying COVID&#8208;19 antibodies against spike S1, nucleocapsid, the receptor binding domain antigens. It also detected inflammatory biomarkers including interleukin&#8208;6, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, procalcitonin, C&#8208;reactive protein whose concentrations range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Use of different size beads integrating with RCA results in a tunable detection range. The assay can be readily modified to simultaneously measure more COVID&#8208;19 serological molecules differing by orders of magnitude.

         <title>A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe is designed, which shows a reversible switch in the PA ratio (PA690/PA825) in response to the redox cycle between &#8901;OH and H2S. The probe allows the non&#8208;invasive and dynamic imaging of the redox fluctuation in mice during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation and the subsequent N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;inflammation process.







Abstract
Reversible imaging probes that allow for the dynamic visualization of the redox cycle between hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are vital to probe the redox imbalance&#8208;involved pathological process in vivo. Herein, we report a reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging nanoprobe (1&#8208;PAIN) for the real&#8208;time imaging of &#8901;OH/H2S redox cycle in vivo. 1&#8208;PAIN displays a low PA ratio between 690 and 825&#8197;nm (PA690/PA825), which significantly increases by &#8776;5&#8208;fold upon oxidation by &#8901;OH, and is switched back to the initially low PA690/PA825 value upon reduction by H2S. 1&#8208;PAIN could dynamically report on the hepatic &#8901;OH production in mice during the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation process, and visualize hepatic H2S generation during the N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;induced anti&#8208;inflammation process. 1&#8208;PAIN can act as a useful tool to probe the redox state in living biology, beneficial for the study of redox imbalance&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Cytochrome P450Blt Enables Versatile Peptide Cyclisation to Generate Histidine&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing Crosslinked Tripeptide Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome&#8197;P450Blt generates A&#8722;N&#8722;B and A&#8722;O&#8722;B crosslinked tripeptides within MRYxH and MRYxW peptides. Removal of the minimal leader peptide allows isolation of these cyclic tripeptides, with sequences further varied by incorporation of a range of residues at the position within the cyclic tripeptide. Biarylitide P450s therefore show potential as biocatalysts for the generation of a diverse range of cyclic tripeptide building blocks.







Abstract
We report our investigation of the utility of peptide crosslinking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes from biarylitide biosynthesis to generate a range of cyclic tripeptides from simple synthons. The crosslinked tripeptides produced by this P450 include both tyrosine&#8208;histidine (A&#8722;N&#8722;B) and tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (A&#8722;O&#8722;B) crosslinked tripeptides, the latter a rare example of a phenolic crosslink to an indole moiety. Tripeptides are easily isolated following proteolytic removal of the leader peptide and can incorporate a wide range of amino acids in the residue inside the crosslinked tripeptide. Given the utility of peptide crosslinks in important natural products and the synthetic challenge that these can represent, P450 enzymes have the potential to play roles as important tools in the generation of high&#8208;value cyclic tripeptides for incorporation in synthesis, which can be yet further diversified using selective chemical techniques through specific handles contained within these tripeptides.

         <title>Tetrazine Linkers as Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Tags for General Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Functionalization and C60 Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous UiO&#8208;68 tetrazine metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is used for post&#8208;synthetic ligation chemistry. The central tetrazine rings act as tags for straightforward framework functionalization by a one&#8208;step reaction with alkene, alkyne dienophiles or fullerene. This approach respects the structural integrity of the parent MOF and offers opportunities for functionalization as well as the integration of C60 in crystalline materials.







Abstract
The value of covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification in expanding the chemistry and pore versatility of reticular solids is well documented. Here we use mesoporous crystals of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;68&#8208;TZDC to demonstrate the value of tetrazine connectors for all&#8208;purpose inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder ligation chemistry. Our results suggest a positive effect of tetrazine reticulation over its reactivity for quantitative one&#8208;step functionalization with a broad scope of alkene or alkyne dienophiles into pyridazine and dihydropyridazine frameworks. This permits generating multiple pore environments with diverse chemical functionalities and the expected accessible porosities, that is also extended to the synthesis of crystalline fulleretic materials by covalent conjugation of fullerene molecules.

A photothermally selective AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP laminated nanofiber film with Janus structure is prepared by fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly method. The two sides of AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP reveal different photothermal performances. Such lightweight, breathable and conductive nanofiber&#8208;hybrid textile enables applications in thermoregulatory garments that possess the performances of heat preservation in winter and cooling in summer.







Abstract
Given health threat by global warming and increased energy consumption in regulating body temperature, it is an urgent need to construct smart temperature&#8208;regulating materials. Herein, a novel fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly (FACA) method is proposed to construct nanofiber materials with asymmetric photothermal properties. The silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) with opposite thermal radiation are assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film, imparting AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP film with Janus structure that can realize the AgNWs side consistently keeps temperature of ca. 11&#8201;&#176;C lower than the side of PVDF&#8208;HFP nanofiber regardless of the irradiation directions under 1 sun, suggesting the adjustable photothermal regulation. Such photothermally selective hybrid nanofiber film provides great potential as fabrics to achieve all&#8208;weather smart clothes, promoting controllable and comprehensive utilization of solar energy.

         <title>How Subtle Changes Can Make a Difference: Reproducibility in Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of complex systems often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and narrow windows of suitable conditions. In this Scientific Perspective, we report on unexpected observations made in our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. We draw attention to often overlooked details and aim to initiate an open discussion on reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The desire to construct complex molecular systems is driven by the need for technological (r)evolution and our intrinsic curiosity to comprehend the origin of life. Supramolecular chemists tackle this challenge by combining covalent and noncovalent reactions leading to multicomponent systems with emerging complexity. However, this synthetic strategy often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and a narrow window of suitable conditions. Here, we report on unsuspected observations of our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. Based on the effects of pathway complexity, minute amounts of water in organic solvents or small impurities in the supramolecular building block, we discuss potential pitfalls in the study of complex systems. This article is intended to draw attention to often overlooked details and to initiate an open discussion on the importance of reporting experimental details to increase reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Nonsubstituted Quinoline&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidant&#8208;free locking of a dynamic imine bridge to construct the ultrastable nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is reported. This methodology features high efficiency, generality, retention of crystallinity and topology. The enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation facilitates photocatalytic organic transformations mediated by superoxide anion radicals.







Abstract
Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant&#8208;free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post&#8208;synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine&#8208;linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ&#8208;COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.

         <title>Multistate Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching through Stimuli&#8208;Induced Co&#8208;Conformation Regulations of Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using topologically chiral [2]catenanes as not only the chiral platform but also the switching scaffold, the first construction of a novel bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence switching system was successfully realized.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum), topologically chiral [2]catenanes were employed as the key platform to construct a novel multistate CPL switching system. Taking advantage of the precise co&#8208;conformation regulations of the resultant pyrene&#8208;functionalized [2]catenanes under different external stimuli, reversible transformations between three emission states with different CPL performances, i.e. the initial &#8220;closed&#8221; form with a |glum| value of 0.012, the &#8220;open&#8221; form with an almost complete turn&#8208;off of CPL emission, and the &#8220;protonated&#8221; form with a boosted |glum| value of 0.022, were successfully realized. This study demonstrates the successful construction of not only the first topological chirality&#8208;based CPL switch, but also a novel bidirectional CPL switch, thus providing a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Ester Electrolyte with Boosted Stability Against Li for High&#8208;Performance Li metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with NO3&#8722; readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath that reduces the polarity of solvent and therefore boosts the stability of electrolyte against Li metal. The electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The Li plating/stripping reversibility in Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;%.







Abstract
In traditional non&#8208;flammable electrolytes a trade&#8208;off always exists between non&#8208;flammability and battery performance. Previous research focused on reducing free solvents and forming anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. However, the contribution of solvated anions in boosting the stability of electrolyte has been overlooked. Here, we resolve this via introducing anions into Li+ solvation sheaths using anions with similar Gutmann donor number (DN) to that of solvents. Taking trimethyl phosphate fire&#8208;retardant (DN=23.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (DN=22.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as an example, NO3&#8722; is readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath and reduces the polarity of solvent. This results in boosted stability of electrolyte against Li. The developed non&#8208;flammable electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The reversibility of Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;% and the lifespan of practical LMBs was extended by &gt;100&#8201;%.

         <title>The N&#1013;&#8208;Rule for Serine, but Not Cysteine Catalytic Triads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;containing catalytic triads are almost exclusively N&#1013;&#8208;configured (the histidine N&#1013; atom is next to the nucleophile). This is in stark contrast to cysteine catalytic triads (and noncatalytic triads). It is argued that the effect stems from the pKa difference of the histidine nitrogen atoms. The N&#1013;&#8208;triads are evolutionarily selected for at the cost of stability to help overcome the much larger Ser&#8208;His pKa gradient than that of the Cys&#8208;His pair.Serine&#8208;containing catalytic triads are almost exclusively N&#1013;&#8208;configured (the histidine N&#1013; atom is next to the nucleophile).

Abstract
Catalytic triads, composed of a serine or cysteine nucleophile, a histidine, and a third triad residue (typically Asp/Glu/Asn), are common in enzyme active sites and catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions. Two types of triads can be distinguished: We refer to them as N&#948;&#8208; or N&#1013;&#8208;configured, depending on whether the histidine imidazole N&#948; or N&#1013; atom is close to the nucleophile O&#947;/S&#947;. In this study, we have analyzed triad configuration. In structural triads, the more stable N&#948;&#8208;configuration predominates. For catalytic triads, the configuration depends on the nucleophile. When it is a cysteine residue, both configuration types occur, depending on the family. However, when the nucleophile is a serine residue, the less stable N&#1013;&#8208;configuration is almost exclusively found. We posit that the energetically less favored conformation is selected for in serine triads to facilitate the otherwise difficult proton transfer from the nucleophile to the histidine residue.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Single Au Atoms on Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction towards CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms in Au1&#8208;S2 low&#8208;coordination structure on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were prepared by a rational complex&#8208;exchange route. Endowed with much faster interfacial electron transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 photosensitizer and more appropriate binding strength with *CO intermediates, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms surpass Au nanoparticles counterpart in CO2 photoreduction, leading to CH4 product with both high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to hydrocarbon fuels such as CH4 is promising and sustainable for carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, lack of proper binding strengths with reaction intermediates makes it still a challenge for photocatalytic CO2 methanation with both high activity and selectivity. Here, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms (Au1&#8208;S2) on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets was synthesized by a complex&#8208;exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au1/ZnIn2S4 catalyst exhibits a CH4 yield of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity as high as 77&#8201;%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au1/ZnIn2S4 with Au1&#8208;S2 structure not only display fast carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH3 intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Stereoselective Three&#8208;Step One&#8208;Pot Cascade Combining Amino&#8208; and Biocatalysis to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Nitro Alcohols
</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic cascades offer a simple and efficient way to rapidly build structural complexity. A three&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process is reported in which a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;mediated asymmetric conjugate addition, and a bioreduction step were combined to access chiral nitro alcohols from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives in good overall yields and excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The combination of small&#8208;molecule catalysis and enzyme catalysis represents an underexploited area of research with huge potential in asymmetric synthetic chemistry due to both compatibility of reaction conditions and complementary reactivity. Herein, we describe the telescopic synthesis of chiral nitro alcohols starting from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives through the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step chemoenzymatic cascade combination of a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysed asymmetric conjugate addition, and ketoreductase&#8208;mediated reduction to access the corresponding target compounds in moderate to excellent overall isolated yields (36&#8211;80&#8201;%) and high diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios (up to &gt;97&#8201;:&#8201;3). This represents the first example of the combination of an organocatalysed asymmetric conjugate addition via iminium ion activation and a bioreduction step catalysed by ketoreductases.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids to Derivatize or Degrade Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;driven direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acid side chains in macromolecules was explored as a robust post&#8208;polymerization modification strategy. Multiple transformations of copolymers were achieved, including derivatization with olefin units, functionalization with pendent alkenes, and backbone degradation. These decarboxylative processes were rapid, selective, and displayed high atom economy.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;mediated direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acids with an acridine photocatalyst is a convenient and powerful method to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals in polymer chains. Advantageously, this process proceeds under mild conditions, without preactivation of the acid groups. We utilize decarboxylation in the presence of a hydrogen atom donor to form statistical acrylate&#8208;ethylene and acrylate&#8208;propylene copolymers, which are challenging to obtain by direct polymerization. We additionally show that decarboxylation of methacrylic acid units within polymethacrylates can trigger degradation of the polymer backbones. Moreover, a dual catalytic approach, which combines the function of an acridine photocatalyst with that of a cobaloxime catalyst, is leveraged to furnish unique copolymers with pendent alkenes. Our work indicates that direct decarboxylation is a versatile technique for the synthesis of functional materials with tailored compositions and properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibility of generating unidirectional, controlled rotary motion by chemical conversion is a major challenge. This Review provides an overview of approaches to the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of various classes of atropisomers that can perform controlled switching or directional rotational motion under the influence of a chemical stimulus. Future strategies and challenges for the development of autonomous molecular motors are also provided.







Abstract
Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are major steps towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light&#8208;induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are major steps towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light-induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task. In this Review, an overview of approaches towards the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of different classes of atropisomers which can undergo controlled switching or rotation under the influence of a chemical stimulus is presented. They are categorized as molecular switches, rotors, motors, and autonomous motors according to their type of response. Furthermore, we provide a future perspective and challenges focusing on building sophisticated molecular machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Bond Microenvironments and Reaction Pathways of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) in water electrolysis is critical to guide the future design, performance optimization, and broad applications of single&#8208;atom catalysts. This Review summarizes the most recent progress in tailoring the bond microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts on different supports and discusses the reaction pathways, mechanisms, and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) are commonly stabilized and influenced by neighboring atoms in the host; disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of SASs in water electrolysis is one of the grand challenges originating from the tremendous wealth of support materials with complex structures. Through a multidisciplinary view of the design principles, synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlations, this timely Review is dedicated to summarizing the most recent progress in tailoring bond microenvironments on different supports and discussing the reaction pathways and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis. The essence and mechanisms of how SAS structures influence electrocatalysis and the critical requirements for future developments are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are also provided to stimulate the practical, widespread utilization of SAS catalysts in water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.

         <title>Reconstruction of Highly Dense Cu&#8722;N4 Active Sites in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Characterized by Operando Synchrotron Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando synchrotron radiation identifies the reconstruction process of highly dense Cu&#8722;N4 sites transform to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and then to Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under potential&#8208;driver, which could regulate the d&#8208;band center of metal atom and balance the competition of rate&#8208;determining step for ORR, thus optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance.







Abstract
The emerging star of single atomic site (SAS) catalyst has been regarded as the most promising Pt&#8208;substituted electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the metal loading in SAS directly affects the whole device performance. Herein, we report a dual nitrogen source coordinated strategy to realize high dense Cu&#8722;N4 SAS with a metal loading of 5.61&#8197;wt% supported on 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes/graphene structure wherein simultaneously performs superior ORR activity and stability in alkaline media. When applied in H2/O2 AEMFC, it could reach an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.90&#8197;V and a peak power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Operando synchrotron radiation analyses identify the reconstruction from initial Cu&#8722;N4 to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and the subsequent Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under working conditions, which gradually regulate the d&#8208;band center of central metal and balance the Gibbs free energy of *OOH and *O intermediates, benefiting to ORR activity.

         <title>Proton Chemistry Induced Long&#8208;Cycle Air Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) battery was developed in acidic electrolyte. The Pb/PTO batteries display excellent cycle stability during repeated self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging process because the self&#8208;charging behavior in acidic medium can effectively avoid the formation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrode.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries usually suffer from capacity loss after self&#8208;charging cycles due to the formation of basic salts on cathodes in the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Here, air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries based on proton chemistry are developed in acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of H+ uptake/removal endows the battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. Owing to the high standard electrode potential of oxygen in acid electrolyte, the discharged cathodes are spontaneously oxidized by oxygen in air along with H+ extraction and thus achieve self&#8208;charging without external power supply. Notably, the air self&#8208;charging mechanism involved H+&#8208;based redox can effectively avoid the generation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrodes and thus guarantee long&#8208;term self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging cycles of Pb/PTO batteries. This work provides a promising strategy for designing long&#8208;cycle air self&#8208;charging systems.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Isolation of An Aza&#8208;Triangulene and Its Cation in Crystalline Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene and its cation were synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. The cation is an isoelectronic structure of triangulene, showing a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of about 0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives is challenging due to their intrinsic high spin nature. Herein, we report solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (i.e., aza&#8208;triangulene) (NT) and its cation (NT+) in single&#8208;crystal form. Notably, the cation NT+ can be regarded as an isoelectronic structure of the corresponding all&#8208;carbon triangulene. Both NT and NT+ show reasonable stability due to kinetic blocking by bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl substituents, and intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Bond length analysis, magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the neutral NT has a doublet ground state with a zwitterionic character, while the cation NT+ exhibits a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of +0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This study provides a rational strategy to access high&#8208;spin systems by heteroatom doping of pure &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.

&lt;p&gt;A nitrogen-doped triangulene and its cation were synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. The cation is an isoelectronic structure of triangulene, showing a triplet ground state with a singlet-triplet energy gap of about 0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives is challenging due to their intrinsic high spin nature. Herein, we report solution-phase synthesis and isolation of a nitrogen-doped triangulene (i.e., aza-triangulene) (&lt;b&gt;NT&lt;/b&gt;) and its cation (&lt;b&gt;NT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) in single-crystal form. Notably, the cation &lt;b&gt;NT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; can be regarded as an isoelectronic structure of the corresponding all-carbon triangulene. Both &lt;b&gt;NT&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;NT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; show reasonable stability due to kinetic blocking by bulky and electron-withdrawing aryl substituents, and intramolecular donor-acceptor interaction. Bond length analysis, magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the neutral &lt;b&gt;NT&lt;/b&gt; has a doublet ground state with a zwitterionic character, while the cation &lt;b&gt;NT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a triplet ground state with a singlet-triplet energy gap of +0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides a rational strategy to access high-spin systems by heteroatom doping of pure &#960;-conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Directed Reversal of 13C NMR Chemical Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding behavior of carbonyl carbon in sulfur and selenium substituted H&#8208;bonded amides. Solution phase NMR spectroscopy corroborated with various computational studies explains the physical origin of such unusual behavior.







Abstract
The deshielding or downfield 13C NMR chemical shift of amide carbonyl carbon upon H&#8208;bonding is a widely observed phenomenon. This downfield shift is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler for H&#8208;bonding. However, the very first observation of an upfield 13C NMR of thiocarbonyl carbon in thioamides upon H&#8208;bonding encouraged us to explore the physical origin of the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding. Careful NMR analysis shows that sulfur and selenium&#8208;centered H&#8208;bonds (S/SeCHBs) induce a shielding effect on the 13CC=S(Se) while changing from amides to thioamides or selenoamides. In addition, natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis shows that the &#963;11 and &#963;22 components of the isotropic shielding tensor (&#963;) have a crucial role in this unusual shielding.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Effects for the Regioselective Zincation of Diazines Using TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (X=Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important N&#8208;heterocycles such as pyrimidines were regioselectively zincated using bimetallic bases of type TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br) and subsequently quenched with electrophiles. Trapping of key organometallic intermediates has shed light on their complex solution constitution and helped to explain the high regioselectivity observed as well as the stoichiometry of the base used.







Abstract
A new method for regioselective zincations of challenging N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates such as pyrimidines and pyridazine was reported using bimetallic bases TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br). Reactions occurred under mild conditions (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, using 1.75 equivalents of base without additives), furnishing 2&#8208;zincated pyrimidines and 3&#8208;zincated pyridazine, which were then trapped with a variety of electrophiles. Contrasting with other s&#8208;block metalating systems, which lack selectivity in their reactions even when operating at low temperatures, these mixed Li/Zn bases enabled unprecedented regioselectivities that cannot be replicated by either LiTMP nor Zn(TMP)2 on their own. Spectroscopic and structural interrogations of organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions have shed light on the complex constitution of reaction mixtures and the origins of their special reactivities.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Functional Evaluation of IORs, Sulfonolipid&#8208;based Inhibitors of Cell Differentiation in Salpingoeca rosetta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and modular synthesis of the rosette&#8208;inhibitor sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A and chemical probes was achieved via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivatives and alkyl zinc reagents of choice. Synthesized congeners and bifunctional probes allowed to determine structure&#8208;activity relation to profile binding partners in producer and recipient for the first time.







Abstract
The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S.&#8197;rosetta. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid&#8208;containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR&#8208;1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes, allowed quantification of IOR&#8208;1A, localization studies within S.&#8197;rosetta cells, and evaluation of structure&#8208;activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and S.&#8197;rosetta. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within S.&#8197;rosetta.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Plus Reversible Supramolecular Adhesives Achieved by Regulating Intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new class of reversible supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive systems by integrating adhesive chains with cyclometalated platinum(II) units in the same covalent skeleton. By manipulating intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, the organoplatinum(II) adhesives exhibit stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa.







Abstract
Surface adhesion has a great contradiction in high strength and good reversibility given their mutually exclusive requirements of fixed crosslinked networks and dynamic chain motion. Herein, we demonstrate a supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive system regulated by intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions that can simultaneously achieve high&#8208;strength and excellent reversible adhesion to various substrates. Upon alternating temperature, the assembly of suitably substituted organoplatinum(II) molecules can switch between well&#8208;ordered and disordered states via tuning PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, resulting in stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa and a large on&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;25. Along with the switch of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII contacts, the surface adhesion of organoplatinum(II) adhesives can be monitored by their changes in electrical signals. This study will open up new inspirations for developing high&#8208;performance reversible adhesives.

         <title>Synergistic Charge Percolation in Conducting Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance In Vivo Sensing of Neurochemical and Neuroelectrical Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach that endows conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;based fiber&#8208;microsensors with an interiorly constructed synergistic charge percolation highway for (i)&#8197;selective and sensitive sensing of a target neurochemical (vitamin C) and (ii)&#8197;high&#8208;fidelity sensing of neuronal activities. This strategy is validated through in vivo applications in the nervous system.







Abstract
Challenges remain in establishing a universal method to precisely tune electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for multifunctional neurosensing with high selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and general approach to achieving synergistic charge percolation in conducting polymers (i.e., poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) by incorporating conductive catalysts (i.e., carbon nanotubes, CNTs) and post&#8208;processing. The approach shows synergistic effects: (i)&#8197;CNTs and post&#8208;processing together promote PEDOT ordered interconnection for highly efficient charge percolation that accelerates electrochemical kinetics; (ii)&#8197;CNTs catalyze the electrooxidation of vitamin C for selective electrochemical sensing; (iii)&#8197;CNTs enhance the charge storage/injection capacity of PEDOT:PSS. The prepared CNT&#8208;PEDOT:PSS fiber mechanically matches with neural tissues and is proved to be a biocompatible versatile microsensor capable of high&#8208;performance neurosensing in vivo.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Macrocyclic Triangles into Helicity&#8208;Opposite Nanotwists by Competitive Planar over Point Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar chirality emerging from the restriction rotation of achiral edges in macrocyclic triangles containing chiral vertices has led to chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to solution systems, where chiroptical properties are exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerging planar chirality arising from intermolecular stacking controls the chiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
While helix has elegant biomimetic structures and functionalities, it still remains a big question how the nanoscale helicity evolved from the molecular chiral building blocks across length scales. Herein, macrocyclic triangles composed of achiral edges and chiral vertices were rationally designed, in which the planar chirality emerged due to the restriction of edge rotation by intermolecular stackings and led to a unique chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to the solution systems where the chiroptical property is exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerged planar chirality was found to control the chiral self&#8208;assembly, resulting the nanotwist with the handedness determined by the planar chirality. Our work unveiled the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of macrocyclic conformers for the first time and provided a deep understanding on the macrocyclic chirality evolution including the excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Chemokine Conjugates for In Vivo Targeting of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for selective targeting of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in preclinical models of cancer. We demonstrate that this new chemical design is compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic payloads, opening avenues in the preparation of future theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Increased levels of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are indicators of poor prognosis in most cancers. Although antibodies and small molecules blocking the recruitment of macrophages to tumors are under evaluation as anticancer therapies, these strategies are not specific for macrophage subpopulations. Herein we report the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for effective targeting of defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. Our constructs exploit the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in TAMs to target these cells selectively over other macrophages and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cathepsin&#8208;activatable chemokines are compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic cargos, opening new avenues in the design of targeted theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Photocatalytic Removal of the Greenhouse Gas Nitrous Oxide by Liposomal Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled liposome microreactors mimic the spatial separation of redox reactions seen in respiration and photosynthesis. Catalytic reduction of the climate heating gas N2O to benign N2 by encapsulated enzyme is driven by irradiation of external carbon dots through an electron transfer pathway defined by a membrane&#8208;spanning cytochrome and redox&#8208;cycling of internal methyl viologen.







Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse and ozone&#8208;reactive gas for which emissions are growing rapidly due to increasingly intensive agriculture. Synthetic catalysts for N2O decomposition typically contain precious metals and/or operate at elevated temperatures driving a desire for more sustainable alternatives. Here we demonstrate self&#8208;assembly of liposomal microreactors enabling catalytic reduction of N2O to the climate neutral product N2. Photoexcitation of graphitic N&#8208;doped carbon dots delivers electrons to encapsulated N2O Reductase enzymes via a lipid&#8208;soluble biomolecular wire provided by the MtrCAB protein complex. Within the microreactor, electron transfer from MtrCAB to N2O Reductase is facilitated by the general redox mediator methyl viologen. The liposomal microreactors use only earth&#8208;abundant elements to catalyze N2O removal in ambient, aqueous conditions.

         <title>Programming and Dynamic Control of the Circular Polarization of Luminescence from an Achiral Fluorescent Dye in a Liquid Crystal Host by Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MCELDs (Molecular&#8208;machine&#8208;based CPL&#8208;emitting LC devices) are prepared by mixing molecular motors and BODIPYs in liquid crystal mixtures. This system shows robust CPL switching, orthogonal excitation on molecular motors and fluorescent dyes, tunable CPL color and programmable CPL control.







Abstract
Circular polarized light is utilized in communication and display technologies and a major challenge is to develop systems that can be switched between left and right circular polarized luminescence with high degrees of polarization and enable multiple addressable stable states. Luminescent dyes in Liquid Crystal (LC) cholesteric phases are attractive systems to generate, amplify and modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In the present study, we employ light&#8208;driven molecular motors as photo&#8208;controlled chiral dopants in LCs to switch the handedness of the LC and the circular polarization of luminescence from an achiral dye embedded in the mesogenic material. Tuning of the color of the CPL and the retention time of the photoprogrammed helicity is demonstrated making use of a variety of motors and dyes. The flexibility offered by the design based on inherently chiral unidirectional rotary motors provides full control over CPL non&#8208;invasively by light, opening possibilities for pixilated displays with externally addressable polarization.

         <title>Anticancer Approach Inspired by the Hepatotoxic Mechanism of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids with Glycosylated Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA&#8208;induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold&#8208;catalyzed  5  &#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclization using a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer&#8208;targeting glycosylated gold&#8208;based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro-PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA-induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold-catalyzed  5  -  endo  -  dig  cyclization using a gold-based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell-based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer-targeting glycosylated gold-based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free C&#8211;H Activation: Strategic Approaches towards Realizing the Full Potential of C&#8211;H Activation in Sustainable Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds is considered as one of the most attractive techniques in synthetic organic chemistry because it bears the potential to shorten synthetic routes as well as to produce complementary product scopes compared to traditional synthetic strategies. However, many current methods employ silver salts as additives, leading to stoichiometric metal waste and thereby preventing the full potential of C&#8211;H activation to be exploited. Therefore, the development of silver free protocols has recently received increasing attention. Mechanistically, silver can serve various roles in C&#8722;H activation and thus, avoiding the use of silver requires different approaches based on the role it serves in a given process. In this review, we present the comparison of silver&#8208;based and silver&#8208;free methods. Focusing on the strategic approaches to develop silver&#8208;free C&#8211;H activation, we provide the reader with the means to develop sustainable methods for C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo Olefin Metathesis in Microalgae Upgrades Lipids to Building Blocks for Polymers and Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable sources are key to future chemicals production. Microalgae are promising renewable resources as they fixate atmospheric carbon dioxide to organic molecules by photosynthesis, with sunlight as energy. Thereby they produce unsaturated fatty acids as established raw materials for the industrial production of chemical building blocks. Although these renewable feedstocks are generated inside cells, their synthetic catalytic upgrading to useful products requires  ex vivo  transformations. A synthetic catalysis inside living photoautotrophic cells has remained elusive. Here we show that a catalytic conversion of renewable substrates can be realized directly inside living microalgae. Organometallic catalysts are internalized and remain active inside the photoautotrophic cells, enabling  in vivo  catalytic olefin metathesis as new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformation. Stored lipids are converted  in vivo  to alkenes and long&#8208;chain dicarboxylates as valuable building blocks for polymers. This is a key step towards the long&#8208;term goal of producing desired renewable chemicals in microalgae as living &#8220;cellular factories&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) Tags for Site&#8208;selective Conjugation, On&#8208;resin Protein&#8208;Protein Coupling, and Purification of Protein Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective functionalization of proteins has broad application in chemical biology, but can be limited when mixtures result from incomplete conversion or the formation of protein containing side products. It is shown here that when proteins are covalently tagged with pyridyl&#8208;tetrazines, the Ni&#8208;IDA resins commonly used for His&#8208;tags can be directly used for protein affinity purification. These Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry tags (ABC&#8208;tags) serve a dual role by enabling affinity&#8208;based protein purification through metal chelation and still maintain their rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging can be applied in conjunction with a range of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods, and is demonstrated for a range of proteins tagged at the C&#8208;terminus, N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions. ABC&#8208;tagged proteins can also be purified from complex mixtures including cell lysate. Importantly, the combination of siteselective conjugation and clean&#8208;up with ABC&#8208;tagged proteins also allows for facile on&#8208;resin reactions for cleanly preparing proteinprotein conjugates in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Ion Adsorption Enables Ampere&#8208;Level CO2 Electroreduction over Silver Hollow Fiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO  2  into valuable feedstocks is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. However, it remains a challenge to possess a large current density, a high faradaic efficiency and excellent stability for practical applications of CO  2  utilization. Herein, we report a facile tactic that enables exceedingly efficient CO  2  electroreduction to CO by virtue of low&#8208;coordination chloride ion (Cl  &#8208;  ) adsorption on a silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) electrode. A CO faradaic efficiency of 92.3% at a current density of one ampere per square centimeter (1 A&#8729;cm  &#8208;2  ) in 3.0 M KCl with a sustained performance observed during a 150&#8208;hour test was achieved, which is better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a low&#8208;coordination Cl  &#8208;  adsorption on surface of Ag HF, which not only suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also facilitated the CO  2  reduction kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale chemical imaging of human cell membrane using Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lack of appropriate tools for visualizing cell membrane molecules at the nanoscale in a noninvasive and label&#8209;free fashion limits our understanding of many vital cellular processes. Here, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the molecular distribution in pancreatic cancer cell (BxPC&#8208;3) membranes in ambient conditions without labelling with&#160; a spatial resolution down to&#160;  ca.&#160;  2.5 nm. TERS imaging reveals segregation of phenylalanine&#8208;,&#160;histidine&#8208;, phosphatidylcholine&#8208;, protein&#8208; and cholesterol&#8208;rich BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane domains at the nm length&#8208;scale. TERS imaging also showed a cell membrane region where cholesterol is mixed with protein. Interestingly, the higher resolution TERS imaging revealed that the molecular domains observed on the BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane are not chemically &#8220;pure&#8221; but also contain other biomolecules. These results demonstrate the potential of TERS for non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free imaging of cell membranes with nanoscale resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Recognition of Dicyanoaurate(I) by a Bambusuril Macrocycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicyanoaurate(I) anion, [Au(CN)  2  ]  &#8211;  , plays a central role in the current industrial production of gold, as its extraction from crude ore samples represents the most money&#8208;consuming step. Herein, we present the strongest host&#8208;guest recognition of dicyanoaurate anion using the bambusuril receptor in water, a highly competitive solvent. The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)  2  ]  &#8211;  differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)  2  ]  &#8211;  over [Ag(CN)  2  ]  &#8211;  .</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Diffusion Aided by a Chirality Change of Self&#8208;Assembled Oligomers under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality switching of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures is of potential interest for designing functional materials but is restricted by the strong interaction between the embedded molecules. Here, we report on an unusual approach based on reversible chirality changes of self&#8208;assembled oligomers using variable&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations. Six functionalized diazomethanes each self&#8208;assemble into chiral wheel&#8208;shaped oligomers on Ag(111). At 130 K, a temperature far lower than expected, the oligomers change their chirality even though the molecules reside in an embedded self&#8208;assembled structure. Each chirality change is accompanied by a slight center&#8208;of&#8208;mass shift. We show how the identical activation energies of the two processes result from the interplay of the chirality change with surface diffusion, findings that open the possibility of implementing various functional materials from self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Zn&#8208;S Batteries in Aqueous Media Through Cosolvent&#8208;Catalyst Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery with high energy density represents a promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, but its application is severely hindered by the poor reversibility of both S cathode and Zn anode. Herein, we develop a &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte containing tetraglyme (G4) and water as co&#8208;solvents and I2 as additive. The G4&#8208;I2 synergy could activate efficient polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple and shield the cathode from water, thus facilitating the conversion kinetics of S and suppressing the interfacial side reactions. Simultaneously, it could stabilize Zn anode by forming an organic&#8208;inorganic interphase upon cycling. With boosted electrodes reversibility, the Zn&#8208;S cell delivers a high capacity of 775 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1, and retains over 70 % capacity after 600 cycles at 4 A g&#8722;1. The advances can also be readily generalized to other ethers/water hybrid electrolytes, showing the universality of the &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte design strategy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By designing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based AIEgen&#8208;ligand with reduced symmetry, we obtained two alkaline&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based MOFs (LIFM&#8208;102 and LIFM&#8208;103) with dense packing structures and low porosity as proved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and CO  2  sorption data. Excitingly, the desolvated MOFs with rigid environment and reduced lattice free solvent exhibit high quantum yields (QY, 64.9% and 79.4%) and excellent two&#8208;photon excited photoluminescence (TPA cross section, 2946.6 GM and 2899.0 GM), while maintaining the external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties suitable for anticounterfeit fields. The effect of ligand conformation was validated by comparing the structure and fluorescence properties of the samples before and after desolvation and further verified by theoretical calculations. This work expands the study on TPE&#8208;cored materials to symmetry&#8208;reduced ligand and might bring forward novel structures and excellent photoluminescent properties in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Arene Activation through Iminium Ions: Product Diversity from Intramolecular Photocycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde&#8208;derived iminium ions 1 form benzoxacyclic products 2 in a photochemical reaction cascade (n=0,1). Structurally different products 3 (meta photocycloaddition) and 4 (aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction) are observed depending on two key substituents (R, R1).







Abstract
While 2&#8208;alk&#8208;&#969;&#8208;enyloxy&#8208;sustituted benzaldehydes do not display any photochemical reactivity at the arene core, the respective iminium perchlorates were found to undergo efficient reactions either upon direct irradiation (&#955;=366&#8197;nm) or under sensitizing conditions (&#955;=420&#8197;nm, 2.5&#8197;mol% thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one). Three pathways were found: (a)&#8197;Most commonly, the reaction led to benzoxacyclic products in which the olefin in the tether underwent a formal, yet unprecedented carboformylation (13 examples, 44&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). The cascade process occurred with high diastereoselectivity and was found to be stereoconvergent. (b)&#8197;If a substituent resides in the 3&#8208;position of the benzene ring, a meta photocycloaddition was observed which produced tetracyclic skeletons with five stereogenic centers in excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (2 examples, 58&#8211;79&#8201;% yield). (c)&#8197;If the tether was internally substituted at the alkene, an arene photocycloaddition was avoided and an azetidine was formed in an aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction (2 examples, 95&#8211;98&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Multidentate Chelation Heals Structural Imperfections for Minimized Recombination Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modification of tin perovskites by biocompatible multidentate chelators realized &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; healing of structural imperfections and manipulation of carrier dynamics, delivering an efficiency up to 13.70&#8201;% with enhanced long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#8197;h.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep&#8208;level defects in the perovskite film and under&#8208;optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2&#8208;Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which passivated a variety of deep&#8208;level Sn&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, an efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with a small voltage deficit of &#8776;0.47&#8197;V has been achieved for the GAA&#8208;modified Sn&#8208;PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn&#8208;PSCs over 1200&#8197;hours.

     alt="Multidentate Chelation Heals Structural Imperfections for Minimized Recombination Loss in Lead-Free Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical modification of tin perovskites by biocompatible multidentate chelators realized &#8220;inside-out&#8221; healing of structural imperfections and manipulation of carrier dynamics, delivering an efficiency up to 13.70&#8201;% with enhanced long-term stability over 1200&#8197;h.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin-based perovskite solar cells (Sn-PSCs) have emerged as promising environmentally viable photovoltaic technologies, but still suffer from severe non-radiative recombination loss due to the presence of abundant deep-level defects in the perovskite film and under-optimized carrier dynamics throughout the device. Herein, we healed the structural imperfections of Sn perovskites in an &#8220;inside-out&#8221; manner by incorporating a new class of biocompatible chelating agent with multidentate claws, namely, 2-Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), which passivated a variety of deep-level Sn-related and I-related defects, cooperatively reinforced the passivation efficacy, released the lattice strain, improved the structural toughness, and promoted the carrier transport of Sn perovskites. Encouragingly, an efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with a small voltage deficit of &#8776;0.47&#8197;V has been achieved for the GAA-modified Sn-PSCs. GAA modification also extended the lifespan of Sn-PSCs over 1200&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fano Resonance in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers the first direct observation of the Fano resonance effect in single&#8208;molecule junctions by the charge injection on the nitrogen atom using an EC&#8208;STM&#8208;BJ technique at room temperature, which provides a facile way to manipulate electron tunneling in the single&#8208;molecule junctions and opens a new avenue toward the design of interference&#8208;based molecular electronic devices.







Abstract
The Fano resonance in single&#8208;molecule junctions could be created by interaction with discrete and continuous molecular orbitals and enables effective electron transport modulation between constructive and destructive interference within a small energy range. However, direct observation of Fano resonance remains unexplored because of the disappearance of discrete orbitals by molecule&#8208;electrode coupling. We demonstrated the room&#8208;temperature observation of Fano resonance from electrochemical gated single&#8208;molecule conductance and current&#8211;voltage measurements of a para&#8208;carbazole anion junction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the negative charge on the nitrogen atom induces a localized HOMO on the molecular center, creating Fano resonance by interfering with the delocalized LUMO on the molecular backbone. Our findings demonstrate that the Fano resonance in electron transport through single&#8208;molecule junctions opens pathways for designs of interference&#8208;based electronic devices.

         <title>On Demand Flow Platform for the Generation of Anhydrous Dinitrogen Trioxide and Its Further Use in N&#8208;Nitrosative Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile continuous flow platform for the generation of concentrated dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) solution with accurate and tunable concentration is reported. It unlocks the use of N2O3 in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles in flow and batch.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a powerful and efficient nitrosating agent that comes with an unprecedented atom economy. However, the synthetic application of N2O3 is still underdeveloped mostly due to its inherent instability and the lack of reliable protocols for its preparation. This paper presents an open&#8208;source setup and procedure for the on&#8208;demand generation of anhydrous N2O3 solution (up to 1&#8197;M), which can be further used for reactions under batch and flow conditions. The accuracy and stability of N2O3 concentration are guaranteed with the absence of head&#8208;space in the setup and with the synchronization of the gas flows. The reliability of this protocol is demonstrated by &gt;30 worked examples in the nitrosative synthesis of heterocycles&#8212;a library of structurally diverse benzotriazoles and sydnones. Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the N&#8208;nitrosative steps are also explored.

         <title>Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Interactions Support a Robust Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Gold(I) Complex for OLEDs with Little Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off and Good Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Robust mononuclear AuI emitters are prepared by harnessing intramolecular Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions. The new emitter displays appealing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as well as thermal and photo&#8208;stability, leading to high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off and good operational stability. This work shows the potential of secondary interactions for developing optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
The practical use of luminescent mononuclear gold(I) complexes as optoelectronic materials has been limited by their inferior stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to improve the stability of gold(I) complexes which display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). A highly rigid and groove&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;donating aryl ligand has been used to form dual Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The secondary metal&#8208;ligand interactions have been authenticated by single&#8208;crystal structure, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The TADF AuI complex exhibits appealing emission properties (photoluminescence quantum yield=76&#8201;%; delayed fluorescence lifetime=1.2&#8197;&#956;s) and much improved thermal and photo&#8208;stability. Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promising electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 23&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. An estimated LT50 longer than 77&#8201;000&#8197;h with initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 reveals good operational stability. This work suggests a way for design of stable luminescent gold(I) complexes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to fibrous membrane materials owing to the complex healing mechanism and particular porous structure. In this Minireview self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes are introduced and described in detail in terms of design strategies and preparation methods. The current state of the art, existing challenges, and future outlook for this promising field are systematically summarized.







Abstract
Inspired by the self&#8208;healing function of living organisms, self&#8208;healing materials have been developed in recent decades to very high standards. As a new direction, self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes (SFMs) exhibit both the configuration of a porous structure and self&#8208;healing capability within one material. Different from nonporous self&#8208;healing materials, it is more challenging to introduce self&#8208;healing properties to porous fibrous membrane materials owing to the more complex healing mechanism and microstructure of SFMs. This Minireview focuses on the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, design principles, and preparation strategies of SFMs. The characteristics of SFM self&#8208;healing performance are introduced in detail, and insights and perspectives of SFM preparation and healing mechanisms are put forward. Furthermore, remaining challenges and future developments of SFMs are presented, where the ultimate goal is the design of highly efficient self&#8208;healing and superstable fibrous membranes.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
Achieving wide&#8208;range tunable emission colors, especially in the solid state of single&#8208;fluorophore materials, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a molecular design strategy that affords wide&#8208;range excitation&#8208;dependent emissions spanning over &#8776;230&#8197;nm in crystalline states. Under the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration, we judiciously choose a rotatable acceptor fragment, o&#8208;carborane, to enrich conformational diversities in the crystalline state and generate conformation&#8208;dependent multicolor emissions. We further show that this molecular platform is generalizable in creating crystalline materials with multicolor emissions. Based on these materials, a high&#8208;capacity information storage device and a finite&#8208;state machine were fabricated to showcase multicolor displays and information storage.

         <title>Reductive Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;Bond Formation in Alumaboranes: Facile Scission of Polar Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of rare Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bonds is facilitated employing a peri&#8208;AlI2/BMes2 naphthalene scaffold, which upon reduction forms an alumaborane diethyl ether adduct. Reagents with polar multiple bonds (C=O, C&#8801;N, C=S) undergo complete scission with insertion of the heteroatom into Al&#8722;B bond. The findings help to understand the differences between Al&#8722;C bonds widely employed in aluminum organyls and scarcely studied alumaboranes with Al&#8722;B bonds.







Abstract
We present facile access to an alumaborane species with electron precise Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The reductive rearrangement of 1&#8208;(AlI2), 8&#8208;(BMes2) naphthalene (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) affords the alumaborane species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)(OEt2)&#8208;8&#8208;B(Mes)] with a covalent Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond. The Al&#8722;B &#963;&#8208;bond performs the reductive scission of multiple bonds: S=C(NiPrCMe)2 affords the naphthalene bridged motif B&#8722;S&#8722;Al(NHC), NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, while O=CPh2 is deoxygenated to afford an B&#8722;O&#8722;Al bridged species with incorporation of the remaining &#8801;CPh2 fragment into the naphthalene scaffold. The reaction with isonitrile Xyl&#8208;N&#8801;C (Xyl=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H4) proceeds via a proposed (amino boryl) carbene species; which adds a second equivalent of isonitrile to ultimately form the Al&#8722;N&#8722;B bridged species cyclo&#8208;(1,8&#8208;C10H6)&#8208;[1&#8208;Al(Mes)&#8208;N(Xyl)&#8208;8&#8208;B{C(Mes)=C&#8722;N&#8722;Xyl}] with complete scission of the C&#8801;N triple bond. The latter reaction is supported with isolated intermediates and by DFT calculations.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Fleeting NiIII Bisphenoxyl Diradical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiII(salen) complexes have been one of the most promising avenues for those aiming to generate high valent Ni species. The present work is a result of one such inquisitiveness where a NiII(salen) complex was treated with mCPBA to form a novel NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. Various spectroscopic tools and theoretical calculations further assisted our observation. This proposed three electron oxidized species showed oxidation reactivity.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s and Galactose Oxidases exploit redox active ligands to form reactive high valent intermediates for oxidation reactions. This strategy works well for the late 3d metals where accessing high valent states is rather challenging. Herein, we report the oxidation of NiII(salen) (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;(1R,2R)&#8208;diamine) with mCPBA (meta&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) to form a fleeting NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species, in CH3CN and CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses using UV/Vis, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies revealed oxidation events both on the ligand and the metal centre to yield a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. DFT calculations found the electronic structure of the ligand and the d&#8208;configuration of the metal center to be consistent with a NiIII bisphenoxyl diradical species. This three electron oxidized species can perform hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Visualization of Protein&#8208;Specific Glycation in Living Cells via Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a strategy for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation based on bioorthogonal chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout, which provide a powerful tool for analysing protein glycation and their corresponding biological functions in living cells.







Abstract
Due to the lack of suitable chemical tools, probing the protein&#8208;specific glycation is highly challenging. Herein, we present a strategy based on glycation chemical reporter and proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout for visualizing protein&#8208;specific glycation in living cells. We first developed a bioorthogonal glucose analogue, 6&#8208;azido&#8208;6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (6AzGlc), as a novel glycation chemical reporter. Two types of DNA probes, glycation conversion probe and protein targeting probe, were designed to attach to glycation adducts and target proteins, respectively. After the protein was glycated by 6AzGlc, two DNA probes were sequentially applied to the target protein, triggering proximity&#8208;induced FRET signal readout. This strategy was successfully used to visualize glucose glycation of several proteins, including PD&#8208;L1 and integrin. More importantly, this strategy allowed us to analyze corresponding biological functions of glycated protein in the native environment.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Catalyst for the Fluorination of Acyl Chlorides at Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst was synthesized via thermal decomposition of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). The Co1&#8722;N4@NC catalyst generated a stable Co&#8722;F intermediate in situ through an oxidative fluorination pathway to replace the substitution fluorination of the unstable high&#8208;valent Co system. In the presence of Co&#8722;F intermediates, KF can be used to replace AgF. Co1&#8722;N4@NC exhibited ultrahigh catalytic activity for the fluorination of acyl chlorides.







Abstract
Improving the stability of sensitive catalytic systems is an emerging research topic in the catalysis field. However, the current design of heterogeneous catalysts mainly improves their catalytic performance. This paper presents a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) strategy to improve the cobalt&#8208;catalysed fluorination of acyl chlorides. A stable Co&#8722;F intermediate can be formed through the oxidative fluorination of Co1&#8722;N4@NC SAC, which can replace the unstable high&#8208;valent cobalt catalytic system and avoid the use of phosphine ligands. In the SAC system, KF can be employed as a fluorinating reagent to replace the AgF, which can be applied to various substrates and scale&#8208;up conversion with high turnover numbers (TON=1.58&#215;106). This work also shows that inorganic SACs have tremendous potential for organofluorine chemistry, and it provides a good reference for follow&#8208;up studies on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between catalyst design and chemical reaction mechanisms.

In the presence of Co&#8722;F intermediates, KF can be used to replace AgF. Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NC exhibited ultrahigh catalytic activity for the fluorination of acyl chlorides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the stability of sensitive catalytic systems is an emerging research topic in the catalysis field. However, the current design of heterogeneous catalysts mainly improves their catalytic performance. This paper presents a single-atom catalyst (SAC) strategy to improve the cobalt-catalysed fluorination of acyl chlorides. A stable Co&#8722;F intermediate can be formed through the oxidative fluorination of Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NC SAC, which can replace the unstable high-valent cobalt catalytic system and avoid the use of phosphine ligands. In the SAC system, KF can be employed as a fluorinating reagent to replace the AgF, which can be applied to various substrates and scale-up conversion with high turnover numbers (TON=1.58&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). This work also shows that inorganic SACs have tremendous potential for organofluorine chemistry, and it provides a good reference for follow-up studies on the structure-activity relationship between catalyst design and chemical reaction mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Salinosporamide Family of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein are the total syntheses of salinosporamides and cinnabaramides via a strategy involving rapid construction of the highly decorated pyrrolidinone core of the natural products from the simple amino acid serine. The key to the success of this synthesis was to exploit the innate properties of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone as a stereochemical controller and unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Our first strategy for rapidly accessing pyrrolidinone cores of salinosporamides involved combined use of memory of chirality and dynamic kinetic resolution principles in aldol reactions of the serine&#8208;derived 5&#8208;oxazolidinone substrate, which was ultimately unsuccessful with respect to enantioselectivity. This failure led us to the revised strategy. The influence of the stereocenter in 5&#8208;oxazolidinone enabled selective installation of the C&#8208;2 stereocenter. The intramolecular aldol reaction of the C&#8208;2 stereodefined aldol substrate was successful. An unexpected hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was observed in hydrolyses of the bicyclic aldol products. This unprecedented substrate&#8208;driven hydrolytic dynamic kinetic resolution was utilized in preparing the pyrrolidinone core with excellent efficiency. Through this strategy, the concise total syntheses of salinosporamides A and B as well as cinnabaramides A, E, and F were achieved with high selectivity.

         <dc:description>
Strategies for the construction of bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels as well as recent advances form the focus of this Minireview. The feasibility of these bio&#8208;inspired channels for exploring physiological events, the detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion is presented along with prospects for the future development of this vibrant field.







Abstract
Highly efficient biological ion channels with sophisticated transport characteristics in living organisms have inspired the design of artificial channels that are functionally comparable to those of their natural counterparts and applicable on a much larger scale. Self&#8208;assembly currently offers a facile approach for producing nanoconfined ion channels that exhibit smart ion&#8208;transport properties, including ion selectivity, gating, and rectification, and have shown great potential for various applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of strategies for engineering bio&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled ion channels. We focus on emerging channel assemblies based on different fabrication processes such as supramolecular assembly, nanosystem&#8208;based fabrication, and polymer&#8208;based integration. The applications of these bio&#8208;inspired channels in the exploration of physiological events, detection of molecules/ions, ion separation, and energy conversion are concisely presented. Finally, future developments and challenges of this booming research field are proposed.

         <title>Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self&#8208;Cleaving Ribozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General base knockout in nucleolytic ribozymes using deazaguanosine&#8208;modified mutants paves the way to scale the relative contributions of the four main strategies (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) applied in ribozyme general acid base catalysis.







Abstract
Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid&#8208;base catalysis to perform phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group to attack the scissile phosphate (&#947;&#8208;catalysis). Here, we present an atomic mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, &#8220;general base knockout&#8221; by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 2.7&#8208;fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that &#947;&#8208;catalysis critically depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that &#947;&#8208;catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic factors (&#945; and &#948;). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic contributions (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site guanines.

         <dc:description>Herein, we synthesized new hetero&#8208;halogenated end groups with well&#8208;determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (o&#8208;FCl&#8208;IC and FClF&#8208;IC), and synthesized regioisomer&#8208;free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y&#8208;Cl, Y&#8208;FCl, and Y&#8208;FClF with distinct hetero&#8208;halogenated terminals, respectively. The single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y&#8208;FClF exhibits more compact three&#8208;dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;&#8722;&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y&#8208;FCl. From Y&#8208;Cl to Y&#8208;FCl to Y&#8208;FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical bandgap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6:Y&#8208;FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6:Y&#8208;FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65%, outperforming the PM6:Y&#8208;FCl and PM6:Y&#8208;Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero&#8208;halogens&#8208;based SMAs in binary OSCs.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Cascade Reactions by a Cobalt&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displayed tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive cascade enzymatic activities with both catalase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like properties, specifically generating cytotoxic superoxide radicals from overexpressed H2O2. The nanocatalytic therapy led to a remarkably enhanced antitumor effect in vivo by further integration with doxorubicin.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy, involving the nanozyme&#8208;triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), has demonstrated potential in tumor therapy, but nanozymes still face challenges of activity and specificity that compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a strategy based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions in the TME for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The cobalt&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N&#8208;doped porous carbon (Co&#8208;SAs@NC), displays catalase&#8208;like activity that decomposes cellular endogenous H2O2 to produce O2, and subsequent oxidase&#8208;like activity that converts O2 into cytotoxic superoxide radicals to efficiently kill tumor cells. By incorporation with doxorubicin, the therapy achieves a significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vivo. Our findings show that cascade TME&#8208;specific catalytic therapy combined with chemotherapy is a promising strategy for efficient tumor therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A cobalt-single-atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N-doped porous carbon (Co-SAs@NC), displayed tumor-microenvironment-responsive cascade enzymatic activities with both catalase- and oxidase-like properties, specifically generating cytotoxic superoxide radicals from overexpressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The nanocatalytic therapy led to a remarkably enhanced antitumor effect in vivo by further integration with doxorubicin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocatalytic therapy, involving the nanozyme-triggered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), has demonstrated potential in tumor therapy, but nanozymes still face challenges of activity and specificity that compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a strategy based on a single-atom nanozyme to initiate cascade enzymatic reactions in the TME for tumor-specific treatment. The cobalt-single-atom nanozyme, with Co&#8722;N coordination on N-doped porous carbon (Co-SAs@NC), displays catalase-like activity that decomposes cellular endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and subsequent oxidase-like activity that converts O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into cytotoxic superoxide radicals to efficiently kill tumor cells. By incorporation with doxorubicin, the therapy achieves a significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vivo. Our findings show that cascade TME-specific catalytic therapy combined with chemotherapy is a promising strategy for efficient tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phen&#8208;DC3 Induces Refolding of Human Telomeric DNA into a Chair&#8208;Type Antiparallel G&#8208;Quadruplex through Ligand Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phen&#8208;DC3 is one of the most widely used specific G&#8208;quadruplex ligands. This work reveals that Phen&#8208;DC3 intercalates in an antiparallel chair&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex adopted by human telomeric sequence, with the ligand positioned between two G&#8208;quartets on the one side, and a dynamic yet fully formed G&#8208;quartet capped by a T&#8208;A&#8208;A triad on the other side.







Abstract
Human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures are attractive anticancer drug targets, but the target's polymorphism complicates the drug design: different ligands prefer different folds, and very few complexes have been solved at high resolution. Here we report that Phen&#8208;DC3, one of the most prominent G&#8208;quadruplex ligands in terms of high binding affinity and selectivity, causes dTAGGG(TTAGGG)3 to completely change its fold in KCl solution from a hybrid&#8208;1 to an antiparallel chair&#8208;type structure, wherein the ligand intercalates between a two&#8208;quartet unit and a pseudo&#8208;quartet, thereby ejecting one potassium ion. This unprecedented high&#8208;resolution NMR structure shows for the first time a true ligand intercalation into an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Aza&#8208;Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine&#8208;responsive Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene organic nanoparticles are designed to induce ferroptosis and serve as sonosensitizer. These nanoparticles promote ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy, inducing cancer cell death and tumor growth suppression.







Abstract
The presence of apoptosis inhibition proteins renders the cancer cells resistant to apoptosis, severely compromising the antitumor efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Here, an intelligent anticancer nanoplatform based on an Aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene dye (denoted as Aza&#8208;BDY) is elaborately established for ferroptosis augmented SDT through cysteine (Cys) starvation. After endocytosis by tumor cells, Aza&#8208;BDY serves as both a ferroptosis inducing agent and a sonosensitizer for tumor treatment. The specific Cys response facilitates the disruption of redox homeostasis and initiation of cellular ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the released sonosensitizer causes efficient SDT and augments ferroptosis under ultrasound irradiation. Detailed in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cys depletion and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation significantly induces cancer&#8208;cell death and suppresses tumor proliferation with a high inhibition rate of 97.5&#8201;%.

First explorations of binary Ge/Sb Zintl anions indicated a situation between a &#8220;matching&#8221; one and one that tends to element segregation owing to a mismatch of atom sizes. Extraction of the ternary solid K12Ge3.5Sb6 allowed access to the so far missing P4&#8208;like anion (Ge2Sb2)2&#8722;, as well as to species that show tendencies for spatial separation of Ge and Sb atoms, &#8220;incomplete&#8221; (Ge4Sb12)4&#8722; and &#8220;complete&#8221; (Ge4Sb14)4&#8722;, as confirmed by DFT calculations and described by Stefanie Dehnen et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207232).

A ball&#8208;milling approach allows the efficient activation of calcium metal and thus makes the direct generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents feasible without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. By using this operationally simple method, Koji Kubota, Hajime Ito et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207118) developed a novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reaction mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which is typically difficult using conventional Grignard reagents.

         <title>Strong Anharmonicity&#8208;Induced Low Thermal Conductivity and High n&#8208;type Mobility in the Topological Insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low lattice thermal conductivity and high electron mobility provide promising thermoelectric performance in a 3D topological insulator, Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S. The low thermal conductivity originates from the strong anharmonicity, while the high carrier mobility results from metallic suface states in the topological insulator.







Abstract
Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&#956;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &#956; due to the metallic surface states. TIs with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low &#954;lat. Here, we demonstrate that Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat of 0.46&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 along with high &#956; of &#8776;401&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. BSTS possesses low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra&#8208;low &#954;lat. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the &#954;lat resulting in a promising n&#8208;type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8776;0.6 at 573&#8197;K.

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt;) while maintaining the high carrier mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;) is of the utmost importance for thermoelectrics. Topological insulators (TI) can possess high &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt; due to the metallic surface states. TIs with heavy constituents and layered structure can give rise to high anharmonicity and are expected to show low &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, we demonstrate that Bi&lt;sub&gt;1.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (BSTS), which is a 3D bulk TI, exhibits ultra-low &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.46&#8197;Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; along with high &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;401&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Sound velocity measurements and theoretical calculations suggest that chemical bonding hierarchy and high anharmonicity play a crucial role behind such ultra-low &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt;. BSTS possesses low energy optical phonons which strongly couple with the heat carrying acoustic phonons leading to ultra-low &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt;. Further, Cl has been doped at the S site of BSTS which increases the electron concentration and reduces the &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in a promising n-type thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8776;0.6 at 573&#8197;K.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Binding Sites in a Chemically Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel strategy by engineering abundant supramolecular binding sites into a chemically stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a) to achieve simultaneously high C2H2 storage and selectivity, breaking the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Developing porous materials to overcome the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation remains a challenge. Herein, we report a stable HKUST&#8208;1&#8208;like MOF (ZJU&#8208;50a), featuring large cages decorated with high density of supramolecular binding sites to achieve both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. ZJU&#8208;50a exhibits one of the highest C2H2 storage capacity (192&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and concurrently high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (12) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;50a crystal unveil that the incorporated supramolecular binding sites can selectively take up C2H2 molecule but not CO2 to result in both high C2H2 storage and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures, providing a high C2H2 recovery capacity of 84.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% purity. This study suggests a novel strategy of engineering supramolecular binding sites into MOFs to overcome the trade&#8208;off for this separation.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrochromic Soft Photonic Crystals Based on MXene&#8208;Integrated Blue Phase Liquid Crystals for Bioinspired Visible and Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by controlled in&#8208;situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene&#8208;integrated 3D soft photonic crystals&#160;exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel&#8208;controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free&#8208;standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid&#8208;IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Passivation for Lead&#8208;Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead&#8208;based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) enhancement). A promising 13% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or aminues are selected, with similar effects. This study provides a universal strategy to enhance the crrstalinity and passivate defects while fabricating stable PKSCs with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall Cu Nanoclusters in Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encapsulating ultrasmall Cu nanoparticles inside Zr&#8208;MOFs to form core&#8208;shell architecture is very challenging while of interest for CO  2  reduction. We report for the first time the incorporation of ultrasmall Cu NCs into series of benchmarks Zr&#8208;MOFs without Cu NCs aggregation via a scalable room temperature fabrication approach. The Cu NCs@MOFs core&#8208;shell composites show much enhanced reactivity in comparison to the Cu NCs confined in the pore of MOFs regardless of their very similar intrinsic properties at atomic level. Moreover, introducing polar groups on the MOF structure can further improve both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Cu(I) sites located at the interface between Cu NCs and support serve as the active sites and efficiently catalyze the CO  2  photoreduction. This synergetic effect may pave the way for the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient catalysts for the CO  2  photoreduction into high&#8208;value chemical feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Super Light&#8208;Sensitive Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Improved Photodynamic Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment. However, the limited light intensity in tissues, tumor hypoxia, and the low accumulation efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs) in tumors are still major challenges. Herein, we introduce super light&#8208;sensitive PS nanoparticles (designated HR NPs) that can increase singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) production and improve PS accumulation in tumors. HR NPs have the ability to produce a large amount of  1  O  2  under ultralow power density light (0.05 mW cm  &#8208;2  ) irradiation. More significantly, HR NPs have a long circulating time in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and can accumulate in tumors with high efficiency. When irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength, the nanoparticles exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy. This work will make it possible to cure solid tumors by PDT by enhancing the therapeutic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Treatment of Conjugated Protonated Polyanilines for High&#8208;performance Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overall performance of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized&#8208;polyaniline&#8208;H+/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high&#8208;efficiency PF6&#8208;  storage. F&#8208;  in PF6&#8208;  is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8208;NH&#8208; in FPHC, so that PF6&#8208;  can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73 mAh g&#8208;1  at 2 A g&#8208;1  after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) (310 Wh kg&#8208;1/7720 W kg&#8208;1). Besides, the relative pouch&#8208;type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90% of its initial efficiency even after 500 h of storage at 30&#8211;40% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries via a Semi&#8208;Conductive Bipolar&#8208;Type Polymer Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries have received considerable attention owing to their green, low&#8208;cost and high safe nature. Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (~10  &#8208;10  S cm  &#8208;1  ), and most of reported promising performances of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are achieved with a low mass&#8208;loading (~2 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10 mg cm  &#8208;2  ). Herein, we demonstrate a semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9 &#215; 10  &#8208;5  S cm  &#8208;1  ). Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar&#8208;type charge storage mechanism. Accordingly, the Zn//PDAN cell exhibits a promising capacity (140 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  ) and a remarkable cycle stability (1000 cycles without capacity fading) at a high mass&#8208;loading (10 mg cm  &#8208;2  ). These encouraging results shed light on the design of advanced organic electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Moisture Accelerated Precursor Crystallization in Ambient Air for High&#8208;performance Perovskite Solar Cells toward Mass Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;pure crystallized perovskite is considered as an excellent precursor for fabricating perovskite films with minimized defects and boosted stability. However, currently available protocols for synthesizing crystallized perovskite must be conducted in an inert atmosphere or with the presence of organic solvent as the reaction medium, which is adverse to mass production. Here, we report a fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase crystallized perovskite powder assisted with moisture in ambient air. The moisture can promote the reaction between PbI  2  and organic salts and facilitate a complete phase transition as demonstrated by a joint experimental and theoretical study. Perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 24.07% can be achieved by using the phase&#8208;pure crystallized perovskite powder as the precursor. Notably, the &#945;&#8208;phase perovskite enables the precursor solution and the final device with enhanced stability toward long&#8208;term aging. This ambient&#8208;air&#8208;compatible method provides an effective avenue to produce high&#8208;quality precursor for photovoltaic application in a large&#8208;scale and reproducible manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Origin of Favorable Substituent Effects in Excellent Cu Cyclam Based HNO Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HNO has broad chemical and biomedical properties. Metal complexes and derivatives&#160;are widely used to make excellent HNO sensors. However, their favorable mechanistic origins are largely unknown. Cu cyclam is a useful platform to make excellent HNO sensors including imaging agents. A quantum chemical study of Cu cyclams with various substitutions was performed, which reproduced&#160;diverse&#160;experimental reactivities. Structural, electronic, and energetic profiles along reaction pathways show the importance of HNO binding and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism for HNO reaction. Results reveal that steric effect is primary and electronic factor is secondary (if the redox potential is sufficient), but their interwoven effects can lead to unexpected reactivity, which looks mysterious experimentally but can be explained computationally. This work suggests rational substituent design ideas and recommends a theoretical study of a new design to save time and cost due to its subtle effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The natural product jasplakinolide is widely used to stabilize F&#8208;actin. Based on extensive structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, we have developed a new generation of photoswitchable jasplakinolides that feature rationally designed red&#8208;shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our lead compound,&#160;  nOJ  , can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440&#8208;475 nm) and rapidly returns to its inactive state through thermal relaxation.&#160;  nOJ  &#160;enables the reversible control of F&#8208;actin dynamics, as shown through live&#8208;cell imaging, cell migration, and cell proliferation assays. Short, local irradiation with blue light resulted in highly localized and reversible actin aggregation with subcellular precision. Our optical tool can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild and Chemoselective Carboxylic Acid Reduction Promoted by Borane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although considerable advances have been made in developing chemoselective transformations of ubiquitous carboxylic acid groups, many challenges still exist. For instance, their selective reduction is problematic if both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic groups are present in the starting material. Here, we address this problem with a simple and mild protocol using bench&#8208;stable reagents at ambient temperatures. This platform is able to tolerate a diverse range of functionality, leaving ketones, esters, nitro&#8208;groups, olefins, nitriles and amides untouched. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic experiments demonstrate that this reaction proceeds  via  hidden borane catalysis with small quantities of  in situ  generated BH  3  playing a key role in the exquisite selectivity that is observed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion (3) and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species (4). Compound (4) is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 gas under the mild reaction condition to generate an ion&#8208;separated species 5. An X&#8208;ray study shows that the anionic part of 5 bears a considerable short exocyclic Al&#8211;C bond, and computational studies involving molecular orbital and Natural bond orbital analysis indicate the Al=C &#960; bonding character.

         <title>Making Polyisoprene Self&#8208;Healable through Microstructure Regulation by Rare&#8208;Earth Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of self&#8208;healing polymers from commodity olefins is of great interest and importance but has remained a challenge to date. We report here for the first time the synthesis of self&#8208;healing polymers by catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of a simple commodity diene, isoprene. We found that polyisoprenes having an appropriate mixture (ca. 70/30) of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures synthesized by using a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst could act as excellent self&#8208;healing elastomers without any external intervention. The unprecedented self&#8208;healability could be ascribed to nanoscale heterogeneities formed by microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix. The hydrogenated polyisoprenes (without C=C bonds) with the analogous microstructures also exhibited excellent mechanical and self&#8208;healing properties, further demonstrating that even simple polyolefins can be made self&#8208;healable if the microstructures are appropriately regulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. However, fabricating soft and stimuli responsive materials with a defined mechanism to tune and precisely control the triggered response has been considerably challenging. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (  PVDF  ) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (  Oba&#8208;cage  ) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. Interestingly, 50 wt% of the  Oba&#8208;cage  in the polymer matrix (i. e. 1:1 weight ratio) shows a very fast and reversible vapor triggered stretching and bending in less than 2 seconds. The adsorption and desorption of the organic vapors (tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and ethyl acetate) by the  Oba&#8208;cage_50@PVDF  film can be repeated many times with no noticeable loss in performance. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides containing a unique sulfur to &#945;&#8208;carbon crosslink. Catalyzed by sactisynthases,&#160;this thioether pattern endows sactipeptides with enhanced structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds&#160;for the development of novel biotherapeutics. Herein, we report the in&#8208;depth study on the substrate tolerance of the sactisynthase AlbA to&#160;catalyze the formation of thioether bridges in sactipeptides. We identified a possible modification site within the sactipeptide subtilosin A allowing&#160;for peptide engineering without compromising formation of thioether bridges. A panel of natural and hybrid sactipeptides was produced to study&#160;the AlbA&#8208;mediated formation of thioether bridges, which were identified mass&#8208;spectrometrically. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we re&#8208;engineered&#160;subtilosin A to a thioether&#8208;bridged, specific streptavidin targeting peptide, opening the door for the functional engineering of sactipeptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creation of new 2D architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH  2  containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO)</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme&#160;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes are powerful since they offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a reaction sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocatalytic cascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamine and iminium ion intermediates and combine these mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes bearing multiple stereogenic centers. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could successfully promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanistic features and activation sequences. This study demonstrates that biocatalytic strategies can match and even surpass in efficiency the potential of organocatalytic cascade catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Germanium Bromide Perovskites with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ge&#8208;based hybrid perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) due to the geometry and lone&#8208;pair induced non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Here, we report a new family of hybrid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites  A  GeBr  3  ,  A  = CH  3  NH  3  (MA), CH(NH  2  )  2  (FA), Cs and FAGe  0.5  Sn  0.5  Br  3  , crystallizing in polar space groups. These compounds exhibit tunable SHG responses, where MAGeBr  3  shows the strongest SHG intensity (5 &#215; Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate, KDP). Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge  2+  and preferable alignment of polar MA  +  cations along the [111] direction. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine&#8208;tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Diatomic Pd&#8208;Cu Metal&#8208;Phosphorus Sites for Complete N&#8801;N Bond Formation in Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergistic effect of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysis in the reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrogen has been widely discussed, but it is still not clear how this effect works at the atomic scale, hindering the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, for the first time, 2D phosphorene was used as a giant P ligand to confine high&#8208;density PdCu dual&#8208;atom to form a unique PdCuP  4  coordination structure, and this catalyst achieves 96.3% NO  3  &#8722;  removal rate and 95.2% N  2  selectivity. In&#8208;situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the PdCu dual&#8208;atom form covalent&#8208;like bonds with adjacent P atoms, reducing the adsorption energy of the reactants. The synergistic effect of PdCu dual&#8208;atom promotes the breaking of N&#8208;O bond, and the short bond distance of ~ 3&#197; between PdCu atoms accelerates the transfer of NO  2  &#8722;  , and eventually the two Pd&#8208;N adjacent to the surface of Pd rapidly combine to form N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Edge Functionalized Top&#8208;down Chiral Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interaction of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#1087; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8208;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8208;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.</dc:description>

Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench&#8208;stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Ru Monolithic Electrode for Efficient Chlorine Evolution and Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating single&#8208;atom electrodes via atomic dispersion of active metal atoms into monolithic metal supports is of great significance to advancing the lab&#8208;to&#8208;fab translation of the electrochemical technologies. Here, we report an inherent oxide anchoring strategy to fasten ligand&#8208;free isolated Ru atoms on the amorphous layer of monolithic Ti support by regulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. The prepared Ru single atom electrode exhibited exceptional electrochemical chlorine evolution activity, three orders of magnitude higher mass activity than that of commercial dimensionally stable anode, and also selectively reduced nitrate to ammonia with an unprecedented ammonia yield rate of 22.2 mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  at &#8722;0.3 V. Furthermore, the Ru single atom monolithic electrode can be scaled up from 2 &#215; 2 cm to 25 &#215; 15 cm at least, thus demonstrating great potential for industrial electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, Molecular Recognition and Chirality Sensing of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Naphthotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic hosts with a well&#8208;defined cavity are particularly appealing for supramolecular chemistry, but they are still rare. In this research, we reported a new class of macrocyclic hosts, namely methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes, with well&#8208;defined cavities. They were synthesized through TFA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions between alkoxy&#8208;substituted bisnaphthalenes and paraformaldehyde. A configurational selection was observed. Three&#8208;membered macrocycles possess a single cavity, while four&#8208;membered macrocycles adopt a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. The small homologue shows quite strong binding affinities (up to 108 M&#8208;1) to organic cations, which is better than structurally similar but flexible macrocycles. This demonstrates the advantage of a well&#8208;defined cavity in molecular recognition. Moreover, these naphthotubes can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations through different chirality transfer mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Thioether&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allyl Halides and Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Csp3&#8208;Csp2  cross&#8208;coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis, in which transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In this article, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid. The cross&#8208;coupling event occurred readily under a mild condition in the presence of a weak inorganic base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a sulfonium ylide mechanism.</dc:description>
