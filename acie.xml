         <title>Highly Strained, Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Porphyrin Cyclophanes: Template&#8208;free Synthesis and Global Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based nanohoops, nanorings, and cages with fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures are highly sought after, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report the template&#8208;free synthesis of a highly strained, bithiophene&#8208;bridged porphyrin cyclophane (1) from a porphyrin quinone via a stereoselective nucleophilic addition followed by intermolecular Yamamoto coupling strategy. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and its dication 12+ reveal significantly distorted cyclophane&#8208;like geometries, with calculated strain energies of 51.2 and 80.7 kcal/mol, respectively. While the neutral compound 1 exhibits localized aromaticity, the dication 12+ is globally aromatic, with the porphyrin unit displaying weak antiaromaticity. Additionally, the dication 12+ undergoes nucleophilic addition with chloride, relieving strain. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for highly strained, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with intriguing electronic properties and chemical reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Molecular Magnetic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium tellurides formulated as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)][(&#956;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#956;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] were reported. Both clusters possess low optical band gaps comparable to those of benchmark semiconductors and slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures. These co&#8208;existing properties qualify them as the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.







Abstract
Magnetic semiconductors, with integrated properties of ferromagnets and semiconductors, are significant for developing next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)2][(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 (Dy5Te6, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] (Dy6Te10), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single&#8208;molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.

         <title>Tailoring O&#8208;Monodentate Adsorption of CO2 Initiates C&#8722;N Coupling for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis with Ultrahigh Carbon Atom Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of conventional C&#8208; or bridging O&#8208;linked pathways, the single O adsorption pathway for CO2 is tailored with moderate oxophilic transition metal single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts to enhance *OCO activation, which can markedly improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of the initial C&#8722;N coupling (*OCO+*NO2&#8594;*OCONO2) and protonation rate&#8208;determining step (*OCONH2&#8594;*OCOHNH2), thereby culminating in ultrahigh C selectivity and efficiency for urea electrosynthesis.







Abstract
The thermodynamically and kinetically sluggish electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is inert to initially take place while typically occurring after CO2 protonation, which severely dwindles urea efficiency and carbon atom economy. Herein, we report a single O&#8208;philic adsorption strategy to facilitate initial C&#8722;N coupling of *OCO and subsequent protonation over dual&#8208;metal hetero&#8208;single&#8208;atoms in N2&#8722;Fe&#8722;(N&#8722;B)2&#8722;Cu&#8722;N2 coordination mode (FeN4/B2CuN2@NC), which greatly inhibits the formation of C&#8208;containing byproducts and facilitates urea electrosynthesis in an unprecedented C&#8208;selectivity of 97.1&#8201;% with urea yield of 2072.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and 71.9&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes. The carbon&#8208;directed antibonding interaction with Cu&#8722;B is elaborated to benefit single O&#8208;philic adsorption of CO2 rather than conventional C&#8208;end or bridging O,O&#8208;end adsorption modes, which can accelerate the kinetics of initiated C&#8722;N coupling and protonation. Theoretical results indicate that the O&#8208;monodentate adsorption pathway benefits the thermodynamics of the C&#8722;N coupling of *OCO with *NO2 and the protonation rate&#8208;determining step, which markedly inhibits CO2 direct protonation. This oriented strategy of manipulating reactant adsorption patterns to initiate a specific step is universal to moderate oxophilic transition metals and offers a kinetic&#8208;enhanced path for multiple conversion processes.

         <title>Selective Activation of Peptide&#8208;Thioester Precursors for Templated Native Chemical Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A traceless multi&#8208;segment templated native chemical ligation (NCL) method is described. Undesired cross&#8208;ligation and cyclization are minimized by selective activation of peptide&#8208;thioester precursors and sequential peptide conjugations. This one&#8208;pot approach, Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN), is anticipated to expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins that are difficult to access using traditional intramolecular NCL.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis enables access to proteins that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional means such as recombinant expression. Chemoselective ligations provide the ability to join peptide segments prepared by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. While native chemical ligation (NCL) is widely used, it is limited by the need for C&#8208;terminal thioesters with suitable reaction kinetics, properly placed native Cys or thiolated derivatives, and peptide segment solubility at low mM concentrations. Moreover, repetitive purifications to isolate ligated products are often yield&#8208;sapping, hampering efficiency and progress. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN). This traceless multi&#8208;segment templated NCL approach permits the one&#8208;pot synthesis of proteins by harnessing selective thioester activation and orthogonal conjugation chemistries to favor formation of the full&#8208;length ligated product while minimizing side reactions. Importantly, CAPTN provides kinetic enhancements allowing ligations at sterically hindered junctions and low peptide concentrations. Additionally, this one&#8208;pot approach removes the need for intermediate purification. We report the synthesis of two E. coli ribosomal subunits S16 and S17 enabled by the chemical tools described herein. We anticipate that CAPTN will expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins and expand on templated approaches for chemical protein synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical protein synthesis enables access to proteins that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional means such as recombinant expression. Chemoselective ligations provide the ability to join peptide segments prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. While native chemical ligation (NCL) is widely used, it is limited by the need for C-terminal thioesters with suitable reaction kinetics, properly placed native Cys or thiolated derivatives, and peptide segment solubility at low mM concentrations. Moreover, repetitive purifications to isolate ligated products are often yield-sapping, hampering efficiency and progress. In this work, we demonstrate the use of &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ontrolled &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ctivation of &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;eptides for &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;emplated &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;CL (CAPTN). This traceless multi-segment templated NCL approach permits the one-pot synthesis of proteins by harnessing selective thioester activation and orthogonal conjugation chemistries to favor formation of the full-length ligated product while minimizing side reactions. Importantly, CAPTN provides kinetic enhancements allowing ligations at sterically hindered junctions and low peptide concentrations. Additionally, this one-pot approach removes the need for intermediate purification. We report the synthesis of two &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ribosomal subunits S16 and S17 enabled by the chemical tools described herein. We anticipate that CAPTN will expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins and expand on templated approaches for chemical protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Production of Thin and Durable Practical Li Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se anode with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties was achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability. The Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability with a superior energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 even under the harsh cycling conditions.







Abstract
Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in situ generated Li2Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogeneous Li electrodeposition. Significantly, the Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability (2700&#8197;cycles) with exceptional anti&#8208;pulverization capability. The Li|LiFePO4 cells show substantially prolonged cyclability over 1200&#8197;cycles with an ultralow decay rate of ~0.01&#8201;% per cycle. Moreover, the Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability even under the extremely harsh conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive&#8208;capacity (N/P) ratio of ~1.2 and lean electrolyte of ~0.95&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, showing an exceptional energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on facile pathway for scalable production of durable thin Li metal anode toward reliable practicability.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synergistic tuning of lattice magnetic fields and interfacial structure stability, this work provides a green, efficient, and universal strategy of Si gradient doping to overcome the kinetic hysteresis problems that have long&#8208;term hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.







Abstract
Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8722;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of surface dense barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8722;xSi0.01O2, 0.6&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>C1&#8208;4 Alkylation of Aryl Bromides with Light Alkanes enabled by Metallaphotocatalysis in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a protocol for the introduction of short alkyl fragments on aryl bromides using gaseous alkanes. The major advancement in this study is the possibility to bypass the use of prefunctionalized coupling partners, often synthesized in the bulk chemical industry from the parent alkane through non&#8208;selective and energy&#8208;intensive processes. Additionally, DFT calculations and mechanistic studies unveiled the factors governing the selectivity of the transformation, offering a blueprint for future reaction development in the field of metallaphotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
@AntonioPulcine1, @KenYamazaki5, @EvelineTiekink, @TrevorAHamlin, @tnoel82, @HimsUva, @VU&#8194;Science, @NoelGroupUvA.The homologous series of gaseous C1&#8208;4 alkanes represents one of the most abundant sources of short alkyl fragments. However, their application in synthetic organic chemistry is exceedingly rare due to the challenging C&#8722;H bond cleavage, which typically demands high temperatures and pressures, thereby limiting their utility in the construction of complex organic molecules. In particular, the formation of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is crucial for constructing biologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In this study, we present the previously elusive coupling between gaseous alkanes and (hetero)aryl bromides, achieved through a combination of Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) photocatalysis and nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling at room temperature. Utilizing flow technology allowed us to conduct this novel coupling reaction with reduced reaction times and in a scalable fashion, rendering it practical for widespread adoption in both academia and industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the oxidative addition constitutes the rate&#8208;determining step, with the activation energy barrier increasing with smaller alkyl radicals. Furthermore, radical isomerization observed in propane and butane analogues could be attributed to the electronic properties of the bromoarene coupling partner, highlighting the crucial role of oxidative addition in the observed selectivity of this transformation.

         <title>Regulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling by Solid Additive for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SA1 additive with a planar structure can enhance molecular order and packing of active layer. In this way, the phonon scattering is suppressed in the SA1&#8208;assisted blend film, leading to a remarkable PCE of 20&#8201;% for the ternary device.







Abstract
Strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling can hinder exciton transport and induce undesirable non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in a shortened exciton diffusion distance and constrained exciton dissociation in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling is crucially important for achieveing high&#8208;performance OSCs. Here, we employ the solid additive to regulating electron&#8208;phonon coupling in OSCs. The planar configuration of SA1 confers a significant advantage in suppressing lattice vibrations in the active layers, reducing the scattering of excitons by phonons. Consequently, a slow but sustained hole transfer process is identified in the SA1&#8208;assisted film, indicating an enhancement in hole transfer efficiency. Prolonged exciton diffusion length and exciton lifetime are achieved in the blend film processed with SA1, attributed to a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and low energetic disorder for charge carrier transport. As a result, a high efficiency of 20&#8201;% was achieved for ternary device with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current. This work highlights the important role of suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling in improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reaction strategy is applied to regulate compressive strain at CsPbI3 surface. The synergistic effect of chemical bonding and strain regulation suppresses interface recombination and phase transition, leading to enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% and promising operational stability with T99 over 2000&#8197;h at MPP tracking which represents one of the most stable wide band gap PSCs.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0&#8201;% and 18.6&#8201;% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% R.&#8197;H. air) for 2000&#8197;h, and remain 99&#8201;% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodiophobic graphite can be converted to sodiophilic graphite intercalation compounds through solvated&#8208;sodium&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation mechanisms, thus facilitating dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal plating/stripping with enhanced Coulombic efficiencies. This finding propels the achievement of cost&#8208;effective and high capacity anodes for advanced sodium ion batteries with energy densities of above 250&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6&#8197;V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18&#8197;V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7&#8201;% over 550&#8197;cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C (10&#8197;min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Vanadium&#8208;Induced Ru&#8208;V Dual Active Sites Enable Exceptional Performance for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating atomically dispersed vanadium species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms into RuO2 lattices, enable exceptional activity and stability for acidic water oxidation. The produced Ru&#8722;V dual active sites with optimized interatomic distance induce a switch from the traditional AEM to the OCM pathway, and the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;V local structures stabilize the surface Ru active sites, synergistically boosting the acidic OER performance.







Abstract
Regulating the catalytic reaction pathway to essentially break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off that limits RuO2 and thus achieves exceptional stability and activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important yet challenging. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of incorporating atomically dispersed V species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms, into RuO2 lattices to trigger direct O&#8722;O radical coupling to release O2 without the generation of *OOH intermediates. Vn&#8722;RuO2 showed high activity with a low overpotential of 227&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during a 1050&#8197;h test in acidic electrolyte. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that compared with the V single atom&#8208;doping case, the introduction of the V dimer into RuO2 further decreases the Ru&#8208;V atomic distance and weakens the adsorption strength of the *O intermediate to the active V site, which supports the more energetically favorable oxygen radical coupling mechanism (OCM). Furthermore, the highly asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;V local structure stabilizes the surface Ru active center by lowering the valence state and increasing the resistance against overoxidation, which result in outstanding stability. This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 by atomically dispersed species modification.

This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by atomically dispersed species modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery, Characterization and Synthetic Application of a Promiscuous Nonheme Iron Biocatalyst with Dual Hydroxylase/Desaturase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A putative &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, was functionally characterized and explored as biocatalyst for C&#8722;H oxidation. AneA exhibits broad substrate promiscuity and is capable of both hydroxylation and desaturation depending on its substrate structure. The utility of the biocatalytic reaction was demonstrated in several oxidative desymmetrizations and in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8722;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the functional characterization and substrate&#8208;activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Dilute Pd&#8722;Ni Alloy through Low&#8208;temperature Pyrolysis for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloy HOR electrocatalyst has been developed from a Pd&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. This work offers new perspectives for designing more advanced electrocatalysts for energy conversion.







Abstract
Designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for advancing anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). While dilute metal alloys have demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing alkaline HOR performance, there has been limited exploration in terms of rational design, controllable synthesis, and mechanism study. Herein, we developed a series of dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloys, denoted as x% Pd&#8722;Ni, based on a trace&#8208;Pd decorated Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through a facile low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis approach. The x% Pd&#8722;Ni alloys exhibit efficient electrocatalytic activity for HOR in alkaline media. Notably, the optimal 0.5&#8201;% Pd&#8722;Ni catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity with an exchange current density of 0.055&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing that of many other alkaline HOR catalysts. The mechanism study reveals that the strong synergy between Pd single atoms (SAs)/Pd dimer and Ni substrate can modulate the binding strength of proton (H)/hydroxyl (OH), thereby significantly reducing the activation energy barrier of a decisive reaction step. This work offers new insights into designing advanced dilute metal or single&#8208;atom&#8208;alloys (SAAs) for alkaline HOR and potentially other energy conversion processes.

         <title>A DNA Polymerase Variant Senses the Epigenetic Marker 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Increased Misincorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase that distinguishes methylated from unmethylated DNA by increased misincorporation opposite 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) during DNA synthesis. By generating 5&#8197;mC&#8208;dependent mutation signatures in the PCR product, the enzyme is able to sense methylated sites and allows direct detection by reading elevated error rates at 5&#8197;mC positions after sequencing without prior conversion of the template DNA.







Abstract
Dysregulation of DNA methylation is associated with human disease, particularly cancer, and the assessment of aberrant methylation patterns holds great promise for clinical diagnostics. However, DNA polymerases do not effectively discriminate between processing 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) and unmethylated cytosine, resulting in the silencing of methylation information during amplification or sequencing. As a result, current detection methods require multi&#8208;step DNA conversion treatments or careful analysis of sequencing data to decipher individual 5&#8197;mC bases. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel DNA polymerase&#8208;mediated 5&#8197;mC detection approach. Here, we describe the engineering of a thermostable DNA polymerase variant derived from Thermus aquaticus with altered fidelity towards 5&#8197;mC. Using a screening&#8208;based evolutionary approach, we have identified a DNA polymerase that exhibits increased misincorporation towards 5&#8197;mC during DNA synthesis. This DNA polymerase generates mutation signatures at methylated CpG sites, allowing direct detection of 5&#8197;mC by reading an increased error rate after sequencing without prior treatment of the sample DNA.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Modification by Ordered Discotic Liquid Crystals for Thermotolerance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we synthesized a discotic liquid crystal molecule (HAT5) and combined it with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to construct an interface passivation layer. The introduction of HAT5 promotes the transport of holes in PSCs, changing the edge&#8208;on orientation of o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation for charge transfer, inhibiting the migration of o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI to the bottom of perovskite, and increasing the activation energy of ion migration. In the end, we achieved a championship efficiency of 25.02&#8201;%. Unpacked PSCs, whether heated at 85&#8201;&#176;C or aged under continuous sunlight for 1008&#8197;hours, can maintain an initial efficiency of over 80&#8201;%.







Abstract
Traditionally used phenylethylamine iodide (PEAI) and its derivatives, such as ortho&#8208;fluorine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, in interfacial modification, are beneficial for perovskite solar cell (PSC) efficiency but vulnerable to heat stability above 85&#8201;&#176;C due to ion migration. To address this issue, we propose a composite interface modification layer incorporating the discotic liquid crystal 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(pentoxy)triphenylene (HAT5) into o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI. The triphenyl core in HAT5 promotes &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly and enhances its interaction with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, forming an oriented columnar phase that improves hole extraction along the one&#8208;dimensional direction. HAT5 repairs structural defects in the interfacial layer and retains the layered structure to inhibit ion migration under heating. Ultimately, our approach increases the efficiency of solar cells from 23.36&#8201;% to 25.02&#8201;%. The thermal stability of the devices retains 80.1&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1008&#8197;hours without encapsulation. Moreover, the optimized PSCs maintained 82.4&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after aging under one sunlight exposure for 1008&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple yet effective strategy using composite materials for interface modification to enhance the thermal and light stability of semiconductor devices.

         <title>Asymmetric Coupled Binuclear&#8208;Site Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature Selective Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 12 asymmetric coupled heterogeneous binuclear&#8208;site catalysts (HBSCs) has been meticulously engineered on TiO2 using a passivation&#8208;tailored electrostatic anchorage strategy. Specifically, the asymmetric Pt1&#8722;Pd1 binuclear sites within Pt1Pd1&#8722;TiO2 have synergistically promoted the low&#8208;temperature selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation through a bifunctional catalytic route, significantly outperforming their mononuclear counterparts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous metal catalysts with bifunctional active sites are widely used in chemical industries. Although their improvement process is typically based on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, it is hindered by the lack of model catalysts. Herein, we report an effective vacancy&#8208;pair capturing strategy to fabricate 12 heterogeneous binuclear&#8208;site catalysts (HBSCs) comprising combinations of transition metals on titania. During the synthesis of these HBSCs, proton&#8208;passivation treatment and step&#8208;by&#8208;step electrostatic anchorage enabled the suppression of single&#8208;atom formation and the successive capture of two target metal cations on the titanium&#8211;oxygen vacancy&#8208;pair site. Additionally, during acetylene hydrogenation at 20&#8201;&#176;C, the HBSCs (e.g., Pt1Pd1&#8722;TiO2) consistently generated more than two times the ethylene produced by their single&#8208;atom counterparts (e.g., Pd1&#8722;TiO2). Furthermore, the Pt1Pd1 binuclear sites in Pt1Pd1&#8722;TiO2 were demonstrated to catalyze C2H2 hydrogenation via a bifunctional active&#8208;site mechanism: initially C2H2 chemisorb on the Pt1 site, then H2 dissociates and migrates from Pd1 to Pt1, and finally hydrogenation occurs at the Pt1&#8722;Pd1 interface.

     alt="Asymmetric Coupled Binuclear-Site Catalysts for Low-Temperature Selective Acetylene Semi-Hydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A library of 12 asymmetric coupled heterogeneous binuclear-site catalysts (HBSCs) has been meticulously engineered on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using a passivation-tailored electrostatic anchorage strategy. Specifically, the asymmetric Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; binuclear sites within Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have synergistically promoted the low-temperature selective acetylene semi-hydrogenation through a bifunctional catalytic route, significantly outperforming their mononuclear counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous metal catalysts with bifunctional active sites are widely used in chemical industries. Although their improvement process is typically based on trial-and-error, it is hindered by the lack of model catalysts. Herein, we report an effective vacancy-pair capturing strategy to fabricate 12 heterogeneous binuclear-site catalysts (HBSCs) comprising combinations of transition metals on titania. During the synthesis of these HBSCs, proton-passivation treatment and step-by-step electrostatic anchorage enabled the suppression of single-atom formation and the successive capture of two target metal cations on the titanium&#8211;oxygen vacancy-pair site. Additionally, during acetylene hydrogenation at 20&#8201;&#176;C, the HBSCs (e.g., Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) consistently generated more than two times the ethylene produced by their single-atom counterparts (e.g., Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Furthermore, the Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; binuclear sites in Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were demonstrated to catalyze C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation via a bifunctional active-site mechanism: initially C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chemisorb on the Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site, then H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates and migrates from Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and finally hydrogenation occurs at the Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Coupling Strategy: Clamp Effect to Capture Mg2+ for Aqueous Magnesium Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work utilizes an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy to prepare a composite cathode material consisting of EDA and Mn2O3 with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms. Not only the outer layer of cloud&#8208;like EDA can effectively prevent the structural collapse of internal Mn2O3 during the charging and discharging process, but also can capture Mg2+ by its bidentate chelating ligand.







Abstract
The rapid transport kinetics of divalent magnesium ions are crucial for achieving distinguished performance in aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion battery&#8208;based energy storage capacitors. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg2+ with double charges and the host material significantly restricts Mg2+ diffusivity. In this study, a new composite material, EDA&#8208;Mn2O3, with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms comprising an organic phase (ethylenediamine, EDA) and an inorganic phase (manganese sesquioxide) was successfully synthesized via an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy. Inorganic&#8208;phase Mn2O3 serves as a scaffold structure, enabling the stable and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of magnesium ions. The organic phase EDA adsorbed onto the surface of Mn2O3 as an elastic matrix, works synergistically with Mn2O3, and utilizes bidentate chelating ligands to capture Mg2+. The robust coordination effect of terminal biprotonic amine in EDA enhances the structural diversity and specific capacity characteristics of the composite material, as further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex situ XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. As expected, the EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 composite achieved an outstanding specific discharge capacity of 188.97&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g. Additionally, an aqueous magnesium ion capacitor with EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 serving as the cathode can reach 110.17&#8197;Wh/kg, which stands out among the aqueous magnesium ion capacitors that have been reported thus far. The abundant reversible redox sites are ensured by the strategic design concept based on the synergistic structure and composition advantages of organic and inorganic phases. This study aimed to explore the practical application value of organic&#8208;inorganic composite electrodes with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotics against Drug&#8208;Resistant Pathogens Discovered via Host&#8208;Dependent Heterologous Expression of a Cloned Biosynthetic Gene Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambocidins are calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a unique peptide core that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Heterologous expression of their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in multiple hosts resulted in production of new metabolites. However, only one heterologous host was capable of supporting production of the ambocidins. The ambocidins bind lipid II at a site distinct from the target of vancomycin.







Abstract
Historically, small molecules biosynthesised by bacteria have been an excellent source for antibacterial drugs. Today, however, the rediscovery of known compounds is a significant hurdle to developing new antimicrobials. Here we use a genome mining and synthetic biology approach to discover the ambocidins: calcium&#8208;dependent lipodepsipeptides that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. By cloning a silent biosynthetic gene cluster (the amb cluster) from Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 2387 and integrating this into the chromosome of Streptomyces avermitilis we induce expression of ambocidin A and B: two new N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine&#8208;containing cyclic lipodepsipeptides active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using a panel of Streptomyces host strains, we show that the choice of heterologous host is critical for producing the biologically active compounds, and that inappropriate host choice leads to aberrant production inactive derivatives. We show that N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine is the product of a heme&#8208;dependent oxygenase and that it enhances biological activity. Ambocidin A inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to Lipid II at a different site than vancomycin. Furthermore, unlike daptomycin, ambocidin A retains potent antimicrobial activity in the presence of lung surfactant, giving it the potential to treat bacterial pneumonia. Our work expands the family of calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a new member exhibiting a distinct mechanism of action.

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids, characterized by non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchors, are developed and used as hole&#8208;extraction layers in organic solar cells. Such simple and tailorable backbones offer a novel platform to study structural effect on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on ITO, which leads to an impressive performance of 19.66&#8201;% owing to optimized interfacial contact and active layer morphology.







Abstract
Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11&#8201;% with a low voltage loss of 0.52&#8197;V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66&#8201;% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non-fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR-DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non-fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR-DPA with linear (C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face-on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry) and non-brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier-free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11&#8201;% with a low voltage loss of 0.52&#8197;V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66&#8201;% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA-based HELs for high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Controlled Desilication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As compared with the conventional alkaline treatment, iPDAs&#8208;assisted desilication allows to break the porosity and acidity trade&#8208;off and build an efficient and orchestrated hierarchical system in zeolites with highly complete framework, opening new avenues to construction of hierarchical zeolites especially with low aluminum stability or high Si/Al ratio.







Abstract
Desilication in alkaline medium has been widely used in construction of hierarchical zeolites for industrially relevant catalytic processes. The built of hierarchy in zeolites, especially with low aluminum stability or high Si/Al ratio, often suffers from uncontrolled destruction of zeolitic framework, accompanied by a significant loss of microporous domains and intrinsic acidity after desilication. Here, we report a novel and simple methodology for preparation of hierarchical zeolites with highly complete framework and minimum sacrifice of microporosity and acidity. The pre&#8208;impregnated amines in zeolite micropores act as inner pore&#8208;directing agents (iPDAs), largely protecting the zeolitic framework and moderating the silicon extraction during the alkaline treatment. The resulting hierarchical zeolites exhibit high crystallinity, tunable hierarchy, stable framework, and well&#8208;preserved acidity, endowing them with significantly improved mass transport properties and enhanced activities in catalytic conversion of methanol or furfural.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Unusual (4+3) Annulation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Oxabicyclo[4.1.1]Octanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1.]octanes is demonstrated via the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinone methides with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The reaction proceeds with the simultaneous activation of p&#8208;QMs and BCBs by Lewis acid. Mechanistically, the reaction entails the activation of the ester enolate of BCB by the Lewis acid. This method is notably straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups, demonstrating a broad scope.







Abstract
Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in the chemistry of bicyclobutanes (BCBs). Although BCBs have been used to synthesize bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, the synthesis of bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed unexpected (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinonemethides (p&#8208;QMs) with BCBs allowing the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes proceeding under mild conditions. With 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Bi(OTf)3, the reaction afforded the (4+3) annulated product in high regioselectivity and good functional group compatibility via a simultaneous Lewis acid activation of BCBs and p&#8208;QMs. The reaction is likely initiated by the 1,6&#8208;addition of Lewis acid activated BCBs to p&#8208;QMs followed by the C2&#8208;selective intramolecular addition of the phenol moiety to the generated cyclobutyl cation intermediate. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies provided insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Radicals with Emission Peaks over 750&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radical emitters with record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum efficiency among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm. The donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the designed radical emitter to exhibit charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding character. Both the high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;frequency vibrations coupling in D1 are effectively reduced, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative decay rate. As a result, the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; is violated and exceptional luminescence efficiency is achieved.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission possess considerable potential for applications in both biological and optoelectronic technological domains, owing to their inherent advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and facile chemical modifiability. However, the repertoire of such molecules with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm and concurrently demonstrating high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) remains relatively scarce due to the energy gap law. Herein, we report two open&#8208;shell NIR radical emitters, denoted as DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM and DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM, achieved through the strategic integration of a donor group (DMNA) onto the Cz&#8208;BTM and PyID&#8208;BTM frameworks, respectively. We found that the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the two designed radical emitters to exhibit a charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding characteristics. Thus, the high&#8208;frequency vibrations are effectively suppressed. Besides, the reduction of low&#8208;frequency vibrations is observed. Collectively, the non&#8208;radiative decay channel is significantly suppressed, leading to exceptional NIR PLQE values. Specifically, DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM manifests an emission peak at 758&#8197;nm alongside a PLQE of 55&#8201;%, whereas DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM exhibits an emission peak at 778&#8197;nm with a PLQE of 66&#8201;%. Notably, these represent the pinnacle of PLQE among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks surpassing 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>Nonflammable Fluorinated Electrolyte Realizing High Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Zn Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of low working voltage and Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolyte has been solved by using fluorinated solvents&#8208;based electrolyte. The reduced solvation capacity of fluorinated solvents promotes the incorporation of TFSI&#8722; into Zn2+ solvation shell, resulting in forming ZnF2&#8208;rich SEI layer. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant fluorinated solvents and PFPN additive, Zn&#8208;graphite cell exhibits long lifetime and high working voltage.







Abstract
Due to the low decomposition potential of H2O and its corrosive effect to Zn foil, the Zn metal battery with aqueous electrolytes operates within a narrow electrochemical window and exhibits low anode utilization ratio. Fluorinated carbonate ester, exhibiting low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, is suitable for constructing high&#8208;voltage batteries, yet its application in Zn metal battery has been scarcely explored. Herein, we propose an electrolyte based on fluorinated solvents and ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) additive, which exhibits a high decomposition voltage of 2.75&#8197;V in Zn batteries. The fluorinated carbonate esters possess non&#8208;flammability and exhibit reduced solvation capacity which in turn promotes the incorporation of anions into Zn2+ solvation shell. Consequently, an anion&#8208;derived interface layer is formed on Zn anode, aiding the compact and planar growth of deposited Zn. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell exhibits an impressive Zn utilization of 91&#8201;% for 140&#8197;h, a level seldom reported previously. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant solvents and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer formed by PFPN additive, the Zn//graphite dual&#8208;ions battery shows an extended cycling life of 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, an anode&#8208;free cell was constructed and stably operated for 100&#8197;cycles, with a notably high average discharge midpoint voltage of 1.84&#8197;V.

&lt;p&gt;The problem of low working voltage and Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolyte has been solved by using fluorinated solvents-based electrolyte. The reduced solvation capacity of fluorinated solvents promotes the incorporation of TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation shell, resulting in forming ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich SEI layer. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant fluorinated solvents and PFPN additive, Zn-graphite cell exhibits long lifetime and high working voltage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the low decomposition potential of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and its corrosive effect to Zn foil, the Zn metal battery with aqueous electrolytes operates within a narrow electrochemical window and exhibits low anode utilization ratio. Fluorinated carbonate ester, exhibiting low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, is suitable for constructing high-voltage batteries, yet its application in Zn metal battery has been scarcely explored. Herein, we propose an electrolyte based on fluorinated solvents and ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) additive, which exhibits a high decomposition voltage of 2.75&#8197;V in Zn batteries. The fluorinated carbonate esters possess non-flammability and exhibit reduced solvation capacity which in turn promotes the incorporation of anions into Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation shell. Consequently, an anion-derived interface layer is formed on Zn anode, aiding the compact and planar growth of deposited Zn. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell exhibits an impressive Zn utilization of 91&#8201;% for 140&#8197;h, a level seldom reported previously. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant solvents and cathode-electrolyte interface layer formed by PFPN additive, the Zn//graphite dual-ions battery shows an extended cycling life of 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, an anode-free cell was constructed and stably operated for 100&#8197;cycles, with a notably high average discharge midpoint voltage of 1.84&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High Capacity p&#8208;Type Organic Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a high&#8208;voltage p&#8208;type organic cathode material of DHTAT for application in aqueous zinc batteries, exhibiting a high capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. After 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the DHTAT electrode retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, indicating promising cycling stability. Additionally, DHTAT also exhibits good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported p&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT mainly involves the adsorption/desorption of ClO4&#8722; on the &#8722;NH&#8722; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8722;NH&#8722; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a stable voltage of 1.12&#8197;V. Notably, after 5000&#8197;cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, DHTAT retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Regiodivergent Functionalization of Protected and Unprotected Carbohydrates using Photoactive 4&#8208;Tetrafluoropyridinylthio Fragment as an Adaptive Activating Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general platform has been developed for the regiodivergent functionalization of both protected and unprotected carbohydrates by utilizing the electron&#8208;deficient thiyl fragment as a versatile and adaptive activating group. This method facilitates the efficient generation of carbon radicals at different saccharide sites, providing a valuable tool for the expeditous synthesis of a diverse array of high&#8208;value C&#8208;glycosides and rare sugars.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of carbohydrates holds a central position in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, driving the ongoing quest for ideal approaches to manipulate these compounds. In this study, we introduce a general strategy that enables the regiodivergent functionalization of saccharides. The use of electron&#8208;deficient photoactive 4&#8208;tetrafluoropyridinylthio (SPyf) fragment as an adaptable activating group, facilitated efficient functionalization across all saccharide sites. More importantly, this activating group can be directly installed at the C1, C5 and C6 positions of biomass&#8208;derived carbohydrates in a single step and in a site&#8208;selective manner, allowing for the efficient and precision&#8208;oriented modification of unprotected saccharides and glycans.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Additive&#8208;Modulated Interfacial Microenvironment Boosting CO2 Electrolysis in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing polystyrene sulfonate into acidic electrolytes induces a local high concentrations of potassium ions at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface through electrostatic attraction, promoting the efficient electrolysis of CO2. Hydrogen&#8211;bonds formed between sulfonic acid groups and hydrated protons reshape the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond network, weakening proton transfer kinetics and further inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges still remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. Although high concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through the electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8208;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8208;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton, as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9&#8201;% for CO can be achieved at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2&#8201;% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to construct nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with accurately tailored biphasic interfaces. Using Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures as a model catalyst for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, this work establishes a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of the catalyst.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8211;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

Herein, a simple and versatile mixed-dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal-on-nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self-assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a series of Au-on-Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au-on-Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface-dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Aqueous Solution&#8208;Processed Pseudohalide Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;temperature hybrid pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskite (HPREDP) ferroelectric was obtained by rationally designed. Further, we explored application of HPREDP ferroelectric in X&#8208;ray detection, and achieved the highest sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (among all hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors).







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their potential for X&#8208;ray detection remains unexplored, and the low Curie temperature (TC) limits the performance window for PREDP ferroelectrics. Here, by applying the chemical regulation strategies involving halogen substitution on the organic cation and Rb/Cs substitution to the PREDP [(R)&#8208;M3HQ]2RbEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;M3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] with a low TC of 285&#8197;K, a novel 3D PREDP ferroelectric [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] are successfully synthesized, for which the TC reaches 344&#8197;K. More importantly, such a strategy endowed [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 with notable X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Centimeter&#8208;sized [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 single crystals fabricated from aqueous solutions demonstrated a sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detectable dose rate of 152&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, the highest sensitivity reported for hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors. This work positions PREDPs as promising candidates for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly optoelectronic materials and also offers substantial insights into the interaction between structure, composition, and functionality in ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Constructing Targeted Strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s Configurations to Obtain Excellent Energy Density and Long Life for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micro&#8208;nano cathode material is constructed by using niobium pentoxide as an inducer, in which the strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s bonds are formed in the C2/m and the refined primary particles are stacked radially. As a result, the modified cathode material exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LMRs) deliver excellent energy density and exhibit low cost, which are considered as the most promising cathode materials for the next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the irreversible redox reaction of the oxygen atoms directly leads to release oxygen and intensifies phase transformation. Besides, the local stress and strain will be generated due to the unit&#8208;cell volume difference between R&#8208;3m and C2/m phases, which continuously aggravates the collapse of secondary particles. Herein, the strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s configurations at the Li1 sites of the TM&#8208;layer in the C2/m phase and secondary particles with the radial arrangement of refined primary particles are designed to inhibit oxygen release and relieve lattice stress by Nb2O5 treatment. Meanwhile, the preferential growth of the active {010} planes is presented to obtain an excellent transmission rate of Li+. As a result, the designed LMR delivers remarkable electrochemical properties with high discharge capacity and initial coulomb efficiency of 276&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 85&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;C, outstanding cycling retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles. This novel crystal structure combining oxygen coordination regulation and micro&#8208;nano scale design provides inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance LMRs.

         <title>Back Cover: Cascading Macrocycle and Helix Motions in a Foldarotaxane Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A foldarotaxane supramolecular machine is reported by Yann Ferrand, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202413977) Depending on pH and concentration, discrete isomers were obtained. The machine operates through gliding of the macrocycle that induces the gliding of the helix along the axle, or via the swapping of the relative position of macrocycle and helix by dissociation and reassociation of the supramolecule. In some cases, the helix sequestrates the macrocycle away from its best station.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid environment was found to play a critical role in regulating the catalytic behavior of IrO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As demonstrated by Jingguang G. Chen, Ping Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409526), the presence of hydronium cation (H3O+) introduces an internal electric field at the interface.

&lt;p&gt;Acid environment was found to play a critical role in regulating the catalytic behavior of IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As demonstrated by Jingguang G. Chen, Ping Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202409526"&gt;e202409526&lt;/a&gt;), the presence of hydronium cation (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) introduces an internal electric field at the interface. It allows selective bond-tuning of the reaction intermediates and formation of partial surface hydroxylation under the operational conditions, which actively catalyzed the OER.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nitric Oxide Modulation via Electrochemical Platform to Profile Tumor Cell Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual nature of nitric oxide (NO) in relation to tumor cells necessitates a precise investigation of the critical concentration window of NO. In this manuscript, we introduce Electrochemical System for Conveyance of Radicals to Tumor cells (ESCoRT) a platform that allows precise control of NO generation through electrochemical nitrite reduction. Our study identifies conditions that induce cytotoxicity, offering valuable insights for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule intricately implicated in oncologic processes, encompassing the modulation of angiogenesis and instigating apoptosis. Investigation of the antitumor effects of NO is currently underway, necessitating a detailed understanding of its cellular&#8208;level reactions. Regulating the behavior of radical NO species has been a significant challenge, primarily due to its instability in aqueous environments by rapid O2&#8208;induced degradation. In this study, we devised an electrochemical platform to investigate the cellular responses to reactive gaseous molecules. Our designed platform precisely controlled the NO flux and diffusion rates of NO to tumor cells. COMSOL Multiphysics calculations based on diffusion and reaction kinetics were conducted to simulate the behavior of electrochemically generated NO. We discerned that the effective radius, NO flux, and electrolysis duration are pivotal factors governing cellular response by NO.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;Tetraose (DSLNT) and Related Human Milk Oligosaccharides Reveals Broad Siglec Recognition of the Atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc Motif</title>

         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the efficiency and substrate promiscuity of human ST6GalNAc enzymes along with a panel of enzyme modules, a library of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) containing an atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage including disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (DSLNT) was synthesized for the first time. Glycan microarray assays revealed broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif.







Abstract
Sialic acids (Sias) are ubiquitously expressed on all types of glycans, typically as terminating residues. They usually link to galactose, N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine, or other Sia residues, forming ligands of many glycan&#8208;binding proteins. An atypical linkage to the C6 of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) has been identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, e.g., DSLNT) and tumor&#8208;associated glycoconjugates. Herein, describe the systematic synthesis of these HMOs in an enzymatic modular manner. The synthetic strategy relies on a novel activity of ST6GalNAc6 for efficient construction of the Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage, and another 12 specific enzyme modules for sequential HMO assembly. The structures enabled comprehensive exploration of their structure&#8208;function relationships using glycan microarrays, revealing broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif. The work provides tools and new insight for the functional study and potential applications of Siglecs and HMOs.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Triggered by Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of molten salts as reaction media to trigger strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) at reduced temperatures for Ir nanocluster supported on TiO2. The strong ionic polarization in the molten salt breaks Ti&#8722;O bonds and lowers the kinetic energy barrier for SMSI formation. The supported Ir species undergo structural evolution with increasing temperature during SMSI establishment in molten NaNO3.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a vital role in tuning the geometric and electronic structures of metal species. Generally, a high&#8208;temperature treatment (&gt;500&#8201;&#176;C) in reducing atmosphere is required for constructing SMSI, which may induce the sintering of metal species. Herein, we use molten salts as the reaction media to trigger the formation of high&#8208;intensity SMSI at reduced temperatures. The strong ionic polarization of the molten salt promotes the breakage of Ti&#8722;O bonds in the TiO2 support, and hence decreases the energy barrier for the formation of interfacial bonds. Consequently, a high&#8208;intensity SMSI state is achieved in TiO2 supported Ir nanoclusters, evidenced by a large number of Ir&#8722;Ti bonds at the interface, at a low temperature of 350&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, this method is applicable for triggering SMSI in various supported metal catalysts with different oxide supports including CeO2 and SnO2. This newly developed SMSI construction methodology opens a new avenue and holds significant potential for engineering advanced supported metal catalysts toward a broad range of applications.

The strong adsorption conversion in CO2 photoreduction process is described by Ziyang Lu and Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu et al. in their Research Article (e202411794). The cover image illustrates lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the interaction between surface sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.

         <dc:description>
Photochromic properties of aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure were investigated by Shota Hamatani, Daichi Kitagawa, and Seiya Kobatake in their Research Article (e202414121). Unlike typical diarylethene molecules, the aza&#8208;diarylethenes showed both photochemically and thermally reversible electrocyclic reactions. The reaction mechanisms were investigated by DFT calculations, offering insights for future research on photoswitches.

Chiral supramolecular living polymers with strongly coupled, delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge&#8208;transfer excitations (CTE) were developed by Jianlei Han, Shigenori Fujikawa, and Nobuo Kimizuka in their Research Article (e202410431). Suitably designed, chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) show spontaneous transformation from kinetically formed nanoparticles into thermodynamically stable, luminescent helical and tubular nanostructures with enhanced chiroptical properties, fluorescence quantum yields, and living polymerization characteristics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface functionalization of carbon nanotubes with triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) is reported by M&#225;t&#233; J. Bezdek et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202412084). Despite its simplicity, the TPPO functionality bestows a range of desirable properties upon the nanotubes, including superior dispersibility, thermal stability and an electrochemical response to ions.

         <title>Shotgun Sequencing of 512&#8208;mer Copolyester Allows Random Access to Stored Information</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated shotgun sequencing of 512 repeating unit sequence&#8208;defined polymers with a molecular weight (57.3&#8197;kDa) far exceeding the analysis limit of mass spectrometry. Chemically activated fragmentation code was employed to generate MS&#8208;compatible oligomers. Shotgun sequencing also allowed random access to the stored information.







Abstract
Digital information encoded in polymers has been exclusively decoded by mass spectrometry. However, the size limit of analytes in mass spectrometry restricts the storage capacity per chain. In addition, sequential decoding hinders random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing. Here we report the shotgun sequencing of a 512&#8208;mer sequence&#8208;defined polymer whose molecular weight (57.3&#8197;kDa) far exceeds the analytical limit of mass spectrometry. A 4&#8208;bit fragmentation code was implemented at aperiodic positions during the synthetic encoding of 512&#8208;bit information without affecting storage capacity per chain. Upon activating the fragmentation code, the polymer chain splits into 18 oligomers, which could be individually decoded by tandem&#8208;mass sequencing. These sequences were computationally reconstructed into a full sequence using an error&#8208;detection method. The proposed sequencing method eliminates the storage limit of a single polymer chain and allows random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing.

         <title>Eliminating Hydrogen Fluoride through Piperidine&#8208;Doped Separators for Stable Li Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated molecular sieve@piperidine&#8208;decorated polyethylene separator is proposed for eliminating the H2O&#8208;derived HF directly by an acid&#8208;base mechanism rather than the elimination of H2O. This successfully enables LMBs with a LiF&#8208;rich SEI and stable cathode structure during cycling in an electrolyte with high H2O content.







Abstract
Hydrofluoric acid (HF)&#8208;induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500&#8197;ppm H2O (ELE&#8208;500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI&#8208;PE separators, thereby shielding nickel&#8208;rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H2O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI&#8208;PE separator is doubled in ELE&#8208;500, exhibiting stable 500&#8208;hour cycles at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6&#8208;V LMBs employing a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode maintain an 81&#8201;% capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles, even in ELE&#8208;1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.

         <title>Gold Coordination&#8208;Accelerated Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emission for Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible Ultrapure Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient solution&#8208;processed ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been achieved using non&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance emitters. The coordination with two gold&#8208;carbene moieties leads to significantly accelerated thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Meanwhile, the color purity and emission efficiencies of the parental B/N based polycyclic core are essentially unaffected by the gold coordination.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) type emitters have emerged as highly promising candidates for high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions with simultaneous short excited state lifetimes and ultrapure blue color (a CIEy close to 0.046 and an emission peak &gt;440&#8197;nm) have rarely been obtained for MR emitters. Herein, we report a design of dual gold&#8208;coordinated MR molecules to achieve efficient and short&#8208;lived ultrapure blue TADF emission. The dinuclear Au(I) complex, namely iPrAuBN, shows a narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with a peak maximum of 448&#8197;nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm in doped film. The coordination with two Au atoms significantly shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime to 7.8&#8197;&#956;s in comparison to 60.6&#8197;&#956;s for the parental organic analogue. Solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with iPrAuBN demonstrates an ultrapure blue electroluminescence with a peak maximum of 442&#8197;nm, a FWHM of 19&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.154, 0.036), and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Improved Energy Transfer in the Sensitization of Americium Enables Observation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reported example of americium circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is presented. The synthesis of a molecular complex supported by 2&#8208;thenoylacetonate and BINAPO yielded a compound that displayed enhanced f&#8208;f luminescence thanks to a unique sensitization pathway. This allowed for the detection of CPL despite weak instrumental detection capabilities.







Abstract
The first example of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a molecular americium (Am) complex is reported. Coordination of Am(III) by a combination of thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and a chiral diphosphine oxide ligand yielded a complex with strong sensitized metal&#8208;centered luminescence. The energy transfer process for sensitization appears to occur via a unique resonant pathway, which results in the removal of the overlap between ligand phosphorescence and sensitized Am luminescence that has often been observed. Owing to this feature, and despite the limited amount of material that could be used due to the radioactivity of 241Am, CPL could be measured. The collected luminescence and CPL spectra provide insight into the crystal field splitting of the 5D1&#8594;7F1 transition. These results pave the way for future studies of Am(III) luminescence to investigate electronic structure effects in this and other 5&#8201;f elements.

         <title>Thermal Annealing Effects on Long&#8208;Lived Fluorenol Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Styrene Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of doped polymer&#8208;based long&#8208;life RTP systems linked to a PVA matrix via thermal annealing was developed. Additionally, by adjusting the doping proportion and annealing time, blue afterglow that lasts for approximately 30&#8197;s was achieved. Fortunately, a new type of styrene detector was prepared while the cross&#8208;linked network between PVA chains were bridged by 9HMF.







Abstract
Fluorene derivatives have been widely developed in OLEDs because of its efficient fluorescence quantum efficiency, but for which unique rigid biphenyl planar structure and large conjugated system, we hypothesize that they have a great potential for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) applications, and confirmed this conjecture by subjecting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and phosphors to thermal annealing. The cross&#8208;linked structure formed during thermal annealing judiciously modulates the phosphorescence emission characteristics of the fluorenol with the synergistic interaction between PVA and fluorenol. Specifically, the lifetime exhibited a substantial increase from 1352.2&#8197;ms to 2874.1&#8197;ms, accompanied by a quantum yield augmentation from 4.8&#8201;% to 11.3&#8201;%, which substantiate that cross&#8208;linked induced by thermal annealing effectively amplifies the phosphorescent intensity and stability of the phosphors, facilitating ultralong phosphorescent emission at ambient conditions. Furthermore, an effective probe based on this film is developed for its highly sensitive, quantitative and immediate detection of volatile organic compounds. This investigation not only proffers a novel paradigm for the development of advanced RTP materials but also imparts insightful considerations for optimizing the performance of polymers in conjunction with functional materials, encompassing bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Uncovering a Latent Bioactive Interleukin&#8208;6 Glycoform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide&#8208;bacbone activation, a new bioinspired semisynthesis method can yield an undiscovered potent bioactive IL6&#8208;derivative.







Abstract
A bioinspired semisynthesis of human&#8208;interleukin&#8208;6 bearing N&#8208;glycan at Asn143 (143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6) was performed by intentional glycosylation effects and protein folding chemistry for regioselective peptide&#8208;backbone activation. 143Glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 is a genetically coded cytokine, but isolation was difficult owing to a tiny amount. IL6&#8208;polypeptide (1&#8211;141&#8208;position) with an intentionally inserted cysteine at 142&#8208;position was expressed in E. coli. The expressed polypeptide was treated with a chemical folding process to make a specific helices bundle conformation through native two&#8208;disulfide bonds (43&#8211;49 and 72&#8211;82). Utilizing the successfully formed free&#8208;142&#8208;cysteine, sequential conversions using cyanylation of 142&#8208;cysteine, hydrazinolysis, and thioesterification created a long polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester. However, the resultant polypeptide&#8208;thioester caused considerable aggregation owing to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence. After the reduction of two&#8208;disulfide bonds of polypeptide (1&#8211;141)&#8208;thioester, an unprecedented hydrophilic N&#8208;glycan tag was inserted at the resultant cysteine thiols. The N&#8208;glycan tags greatly stabilized polypeptide&#8208;thioester. The subsequent native chemical ligation and desulfurization successfully gave a whole 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 polypeptide (183&#8208;amino acids). Removal of four N&#8208;glycan tags and immediate one&#8208;pot in vitro folding protocol efficiently produced the folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6. The folded 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6 exhibited potent cell proliferation activity. The combined studies with molecular dynamics simulation, semisynthesis, and bioassays predict the bioactive conformation of latent 143glycosyl&#8208;IL&#8208;6.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LSPR effect can efficiently promote interatomic transfer of plasmon hot carriers and the extra hot electrons transferred on Cu atoms from Au atoms effectively enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, thereby accelerating the ENRR. This study provides an important reference for understanding the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of alloy heterogeneous nanostructure.







Abstract
Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmon&#8208;promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmon hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9&#8201;%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.

         <title>Native Proteomics by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteomics enabled the measurement of protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome, via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis to an ultra&#8208;high mass range Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based native proteomics agreed well with native mass photometry regarding the mass distribution of detected proteins.







Abstract
Native proteomics measures endogenous proteoforms and protein complexes under a near physiological condition using native mass spectrometry (nMS) coupled with liquid&#8208;phase separations. Native proteomics should provide the most accurate bird's&#8208;eye view of proteome dynamics within cells, which is fundamental for understanding almost all biological processes. nMS has been widely employed to characterize well&#8208;purified protein complexes. However, there are only very few trials of utilizing nMS to measure proteoforms and protein complexes in a complex sample (i.e., a whole cell lysate). Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra&#8208;high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE&#8208;MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115&#8208;kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1&#8197;ng of protein material. nCZE&#8208;MS analysis of an E.coli cell lysate detected 72&#8197;proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8211;400&#8197;kDa in a single run while consuming only 50&#8208;ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.

Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra-high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE-MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115-kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1&#8197;ng of protein material. nCZE-MS analysis of an &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; cell lysate detected 72&#8197;proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8211;400&#8197;kDa in a single run while consuming only 50-ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiral&#8208;Concave Prussian Blue Crystals with Rich Steps: Growth Mechanism and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work meticulously examined the kinetics&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram of the spiral concave hexacyanoferrate (SC&#8208;HCF) microcrystals. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral&#8208;concave structures.







Abstract
Investigating the formation and transformation mechanisms of spiral&#8208;concave crystals holds significant potential for advancing innovative material design and comprehension. We examined the kinetics&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms of Prussian Blue crystals with spiral concave structures, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram. The spiral&#8208;concave hexacyanoferrate (SC&#8208;HCF) crystals, characterized by high&#8208;density surface steps and a low stress&#8208;strain architecture, exhibit enhanced activity due to their facile interaction with reactants. Notably, the coordination environment of SC&#8208;HCF can be precisely modulated by the introduction of diverse metals. Utilizing X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, we elucidated the formation mechanism of SC&#8208;HCF to Co&#8208;HCF facilitated by oriented adsorption&#8208;ion exchange (OA&#8208;IE) process. Both experimental data, and density functional theory confirm that Co&#8208;HCF possesses an optimized energy band structure, capable of adjusting the local electronic environment and enhancing the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral&#8208;concave structures.

This study developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8211;Khand polymerization method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli.







Abstract
Polymers containing lactam structures play a crucial role in both natural biological systems and human life, and their synthesis, functions and applications are of utmost importance for biomimetics and the creation of new materials. In this study, we developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8211;Khand polymerization (h&#8208;PKP) method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights of the resulting poly(N&#8722;Ts/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers exhibit high solid&#8208;state luminescence and demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli. They further demonstrate strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability. The unique dual&#8208;emission peaks observed in poly(N&#8722;H/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s obtained through post&#8208;treatment under acidic conditions demonstrate a mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular excited&#8208;state proton transfer specific to lactam structures. The efficient one&#8208;pot synthetic method for poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam) provides a novel strategy for constructing polymers with &#947;&#8208;lactam structures in the main chain and the simple and efficient post&#8208;modification method offer a versatile toolbox for functionalizing poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s to expand their potential applications.

         <title>Surface Cladding Engineering via Oxygen Sulfur Distribution for Stable Electrocatalytic Oxygen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This word developed a surface&#8208;cladding strategy in oxygen&#8208;sulfur interface to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen in OER. Multiple in situ characterization technologies and density functional theory calculations reveal that that the stable interfacial O&#8722;Ni&#8722;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8722;O covalency. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the balance between activity and stability and thus enhances the electrochemical performance by controlling coating interface.







Abstract
Inevitable leaching and corrosion under anodic oxidative environment greatly restrict the lifespan of most catalysts with excellent primitive activity for oxygen production. Here, based on Fick&#8217; s Law, we present a surface cladding strategy to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen triggering by directional flow of interfacial electrons and strong electronic interactions via constructing elaborately cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure with controlled surface thickness. Multiple in situ characterization technologies indicated that this strategy can effectively prevent the irreversible Ni ions leaching and inhibit lattice oxygen from participating in anodic reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the stable interfacial O&#8722;Ni&#8722;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8722;O covalency. This would suppress the overoxidation of Ni and simultaneously fixing the lattice oxygen, thus enabling catalysts with boosted corrosion resistance without sacrificing its activity. Consequently, this cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure exhibits excellent performance with a low overpotential of 256&#8197;mV after 500&#8197;h. Based on Fick's law, this work demonstrates the positive effect of surface modification through precisely adjusting of the oxygen&#8208;sulfur exchange process, which has paved an innovative and effective way to solve the instability problem of anodic oxidation.

         <title>Multifunctional Interface Layer Constructed by Trace Zwitterions for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace zwitterionic additive endows the Zn||Zn cells with a cycling life of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And the Zn||I2 full cell exhibits 95&#8201;% capacity retention after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The inhomogeneous plating/stripping of Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, severely restricts its cycling life&#8208;span. Here, trace zwitterions (trifluoroacetate pyridine, TFAPD) are introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to construct a multifunctional interface that enhances the reversibility of Zn anode. The TFA&#8722; anions with strong specific adsorption adhere onto the Zn surface to reconstruct the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), preventing the hydrogen evolution and corrosion side reactions caused by free H2O. The Py+ cations accumulate on the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Zn anode with the force of electric field during Zn2+ plating, forming a shielding layer to uniformize the deposition of Zn2+. Besides, the adsorbed TFA&#8722; and Py+ promote the desolvation process of Zn2+ resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, the Zn||Zn cells present an outstanding cycling performance of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And even at 85&#8201;% utilization rate of Zn, it can stably cycle for over 200&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of over 95&#8201;% even after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Synthesis of Multifunctional Organic Molecules via Michael Addition Reaction to Manage Perovskite Crystallization and Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a multifunctional organic small molecule additive in a targeted manner, successfully controlling the crystallization and defects in perovskite films, effectively releasing the residual strain in the perovskite film and reducing the hysteresis phenomenon. The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs exceeds 25.7&#8201;% based on this strategy.







Abstract
Additive engineering plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;quality light&#8208;absorbing layers for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Various functional groups within the additives exert distinct regulatory effects on the perovskite layer. However, few additive molecules can synergistically fulfill the dual functions of regulating crystallization and passivating defects. Here, we custom&#8208;synthesized 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) organic small molecules with diverse functional groups as additives to modulate crystallization and defects in perovskite films via the Michael addition reaction. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the &#8722;OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead&#8208;iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the enhanced C=O and &#8722;NH2 motifs interact with the A&#8208;site cation via hydrogen bonding, which relieves residual strain and adjusts crystal orientation. This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the UPy&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs reaches 1.20&#8197;V, and the fill factor surpasses 84&#8201;%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75&#8201;%. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device maintained 96.9&#8201;% and 94.5&#8201;% of its initial efficiency following 3,360&#8197;hours of dark storage and 1,866&#8197;hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries Operating Stably under &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;based chemistries enables ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide redox couple with high concentration of 0.8&#8197;M to access a broad range of physicochemical and electrochemical properties at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C that represents the lowest operating temperature for ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte reported so far.







Abstract
Alkaline ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide&#8208;based flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their features of high electrochemical activity, good kinetics and low material cost. However, they suffer from low energy density and poor temperature adaptability. The ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte exhibits low solubility (~0.4&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C) in NaOH&#8208; or KOH&#8208;based supporting electrolyte and can easily form precipitates below room temperature. Here we report a lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte that significantly enhances the solubility of ferrocyanide. The use of LiOH intensifies the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between water molecules and solutes and cripples polarization among ferrocyanide ions. Thus, we have achieved a ferrocyanide&#8208;based catholyte of 1.7&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C and of 0.8&#8197;M at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. A zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on the lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte demonstrates a steady charge energy of ~72&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and maintains stable for ~4200&#8197;cycles (~4200&#8197;hours). Furthermore, it remains stable for ~800&#8197;cycles (~800&#8197;hours) at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diarylethenes Undergoing Both Photochemically and Thermally Reversible Electrocyclic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure undergo bidirectional thermal isomerization in addition to bidirectional photochemical isomerization due to a small energy difference between the open&#8208; and the closed&#8208;ring isomers. Kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed the detailed mechanisms of the photochemical and thermal reactions. Using these unique properties, both light&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing and heat&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing systems were demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring novel molecular photoswitches plays a crucial role in the field of photo&#8208;functional materials chemistry. In this study, we synthesized aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure and investigated their photochromic properties. Unlike previously reported aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which exhibit fast thermally reversible photochromism, the compounds synthesized here exhibited pseudo&#8208;photochemically reversible photochromism. Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed&#8208;ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza&#8208;diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions but also thermal ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy&#8208;level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers. Furthermore, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy revealed that both photochemically and thermally generated closed&#8208;ring isomers adopt the same molecular structure, which was well explained based on the reaction mechanism of photochemical and thermal ring&#8208;closing reactions. These findings not only advance the field of aza&#8208;diarylethenes but also inspire future research in the development of new photoswitches.

         <title>Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano&#8208;sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD&#8208;based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high&#8208;quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.

The green crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with Na on NaCl were shown to contain the free dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 that forms alongside the previously characterized yellow crystals of the alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The interplay between :AlAriPr8 and AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 in solution was examined in detail with small molecule activation studies and computational methods.







Abstract
Careful analysis of the crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with sodium on sodium chloride showed them to contain the long sought&#8208;after dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 (1) that forms alongside the previously characterized alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 1 revealed a nearly planar, trans&#8208;bent C(ipso)AlAlC(ipso) core with an Al&#8722;Al distance of 2.648(2)&#8197;&#197;. The molecular and electronic structure of 1 are consistent with an Al&#8722;Al double dative interaction augmented with diradical character and stabilized by dispersion interactions. Density functional theory calculations showed that the reactivity of :AlAriPr8 with dihydrogen involves 1, not :AlAriPr8, as the reactive species. In contrast, the reaction of :AlAriPr8 with ethylene gave two products, the 1,4&#8208;dialuminacyclohexane AriPr8Al(C2H4)2AlAriPr8 (2) and the aluminacyclopentane AriPr8Al(C4H8) (3), that can both form from the aluminacyclopropane intermediate AriPr8Al(C2H4). Although the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1 with two equivalents of ethylene was also calculated to be exergonic, it is likely to be kinetically blocked by the numerous isopropyl substituents surrounding the Al&#8722;Al bond. Attempts to fine&#8208;tune the steric bulk of the terphenyl ligand to allow stronger Al&#8722;Al bonding were unsuccessful, leading to the isolation of the sodium salt of a cyclotrialuminene, Na2[AlAriPr6]3 (4), instead of AriPr6AlAlAriPr6.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational and effective design of a universal near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbed platform employed to prepare diverse activatable NIR fluorogenic probes for in vivo imaging and the imaging&#8208;guided tumor resection remains less exploited but highly meaningful. Herein, mandelic acid with a core structure of 4&#8208;hydroxylbenzyl alcohol to link recognition unit, a fluorophore and a quencher was employed to prepare activatable probes. We exemplified ester as carboxylesterase (CE)&#8208;recognized unit, ferrocene as quencher and phenothiazinium as NIR fluorophore to afford fluorogenic probes termed NBS&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE and NBS&#8208;C&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE. These probes enabled the conversion toward CE with significant fluorescence increases and successfully discriminate CE activity in cells. NIR light enhances the tumor penetration and enable imaging&#8208;guided orthotopic tumor resection. This specific case demonstrated that this platform can be effectively used to construct diverse NIR probes for imaging analytes in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) with peri&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Edges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthracene has served as an important building block of conjugated polymers with the connecting positions playing a crucial role for the electronic structures. Herein, anthracene units have been coupled through their 2,7&#8208;carbons to develop an unprecedented, conjugated polymer, namely, poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) featuring additional peri&#8208;fused porphyrin edges. The synthesis starts from a 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;nickel(II) porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene as the pivotal precursor. Polymerization is achieved by an AA&#8208;type Yamamoto coupling, followed by a polymer&#8208;analogous oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to obtain a peri&#8208;fusion between porphyrin and anthracene moieties. Although further cyclodehydrogenation between the repeating units cannot be achieved in solution, the thermal treatment of the precursor polymer derived from 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene on a metal surface realizes the full cyclodehydrogenation. The difference between solution and on&#8208;surface reactivity can be rationalized by the larger dihedral angle between repeat units in solution, which is reduced under the pronounced interaction with the metal surface. The peri&#8208;fusion in the title polymer gives rise to a narrow electronic band gap optical absorptions extending far into the near&#8208;infrared region. Oligomeric models are synthesized as well to support the analyses of the electronic and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The Photodynamic Agent Designed by Involvement of Hydrogen Atom Transfer&#160;for Enhancing Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy has attracted increasingly growing interest due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, the design of effective Type&#8208;I photosensitizers remains a challenge. In this work, we report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by the involvement of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). As a proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;involved Type&#8208;I PS, which simultaneously generates superoxide and carbon&#8208;centered radicals under light&#8208;irradiation, was synthesized. This photosensitizer is comprised of a fluorene&#8208;substituted BODIPY unit as an electron acceptor covalently linked with a triphenylamine moiety as an electron donor. Under light&#8208;irradiation, photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer occurs to generate the BODIPY anion radical and triphenylamine cation radical. The former transfers electrons to oxygen to generate O2&#8722;&#8226;, while the latter loses a proton to produce a benzyl carbon&#8208;centered radical which is well characterized. The resulting carbon&#8208;centered radicals efficiently oxidize NADH by HAT reaction. This photosensitizer demonstrates remarkable photocytotoxicity even under hypoxic conditions, along with outstanding in vivo antitumor efficacy in mouse models bearing HeLa tumors. This work offers a novel strategy for the design of Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by involvement of HAT.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature&#8208;inspired N, O Co&#8208;Coordinated Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a pivotal pathway for the distributed production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In nature, enzymes containing manganese (Mn) centers can convert reactive oxygen species into H2O2. However, Mn&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for 2e&#8722; ORR are scarcely reported. Herein, we developed a nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst comprising N, O co&#8208;coordinated Mn sites, utilizing carbon dots as the modulation platform (Mn CD/C). As&#8208;synthesized Mn CD/C exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.786 V and a maximum H2O2 selectivity of 95.8%. Impressively, Mn CD/C continuously produced 0.1 M H2O2 solution at 200 mA/cm2 for 50 h in the flow cell, with negligible loss in activity and H2O2 faradaic efficiency, demonstrating practical application potential. The enhanced activity was attributed to the incorporation of Mn atomic sites into the carbon dots. Theoretical calculations revealed that the N, O co&#8208;coordinated structure, combined with abundant oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon dots, optimized the binding strength of intermediate *OOH at the Mn sites to the apex of the catalytic activity volcano. This work illustrates that carbon dots can serve as a versatile platform for modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and for the rational design of nature&#8208;inspired catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cu&#8208;Pd Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for Selective CO  2   Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC = benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8208;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu-Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3-xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC = benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties.

         <title>Novel Inorganic&#8208;Organic Dual&#8208;Photosensitizing Dinuclear&#8208;Metal Self&#8208;Assembly System for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis without Sacrificial Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the unique synergistic effect, dinuclear&#8208;metal&#8208;molecule&#8208;catalysts (DMCs) show excellent performance in catalytic fields. However, for overall photocatalytic CO2 reaction (CO2RR), it is still a challenge to construct well&#8208;matched photosensitizer (PS) components for DMCs&#8208;based photocatalysts. Inorganic&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot PS possesses capacities of multiple exciton generation and catalyzing water oxidation but is incompatible with DMCs. In contrast, organic PS can be covalently linked with DMCs but inescapable of using sacrificial electron donors. For overall photocatalytic CO2RR, organic&#8208;inorganic dual&#8208;photosensitizing system might be a promising candidate. Herein, we employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;sensitized Co2L DMCs (Py&#8208;Co2L) and perovskite (PVK) quantum dots, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. Using H2O as an electron donor, PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L] realized 105.24 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 CO yield in photocatalytic CO2RR, much higher than PVK (15.44 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) and PVK@Co2L (32.30 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1), ascribing to the efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer. The experimental results and theoretical investigations demonstrated that the pyrene linked on Co2L boosted the electron delivery from PVK to DMCs. Besides, this strategy could also be extended to the photocatalytic H2 evolution coupled with alcohol oxidation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work lightens the integration of DMCs, organic and inorganic PS components, promoting the development of photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Propane Dehydrogenation to Propylene via Electron Hole&#8208;Hydrogen Coupling on Cobalt Metal Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane is useful for the high selectivity to propylene but is suffering from the heavy coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Herein, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of a hole&#8208;hydrogen (H) couple on a metallic cobalt surface to decrease the deactivation rate. The coupled H atoms on the Co surface, partially resulting from propane dehydrogenation, enabled the desorption of propylene to avoid deep hydrogenolysis and coke deposition and realize selective and durable propylene production, while conventional Co metal&#8208;based catalysts do not generate propylene. The optimized hole&#8208;H coupled Co catalyst provided a low deactivation rate (0.0036 h&#8722;1) and a high turnover frequency (55.6 h&#8722;1) for propylene production with a high propane flux (48 vol.% C3H8 in gas feeds) at 550 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Chaperone&#8208;Derived Copper(I)&#8208;Binding Peptide Nanofibers Disrupt Copper Homeostasis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone&#8208;inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MT/CGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co&#8208;chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self&#8208;assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly&#8208;enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease&#8208;relevant metal ion homeostasis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2&#160;and O2&#160;under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2&#160;at lower temperatures and O2&#160;at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from ~60 kJ/mol to ~130 kJ/mol. We derive energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways that involve uni&#8208; or bimolecular decomposition of reactive oxygen intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamentals and Challenges of Ligand Modification in Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient catalytic materials in the energy field could promote the structural transformation from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable energy. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ligand modification is an effective way to regulate both electronic and steric structures of catalytic sites, thus paving a prospective avenue to design the interfacial structures of heterogeneous catalysts for energy conversion. Although great achievements have been obtained for the study and applications of heterogeneous ligand&#8208;modified catalysts, the systematical refinements of ligand modification strategies are still lacking. Here, we reviewed the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios by focusing on heterogeneous electrocatalysis. We elucidated the ligand&#8208;modified catalysts in detail from the perspectives of basic concepts, preparation, regulation of physicochemical properties of catalytic sites, and applications in different electrocatalysis. Notably, we bridged the electrocatalytic performance with the electronic/steric effects induced by ligand modification to gain intrinsic structure&#8208;performance relations. We also discussed the challenges and future perspectives of ligand modification strategies in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the influence of oxygen on drug release dynamics in semipermeable polymersomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semipermeable polymersomes, a class of polymeric vesicles that allow molecular passage across their membranes, offer significant potential for controlled drug delivery. These vesicles can be designed for inherent or selective permeability through the choice of suitable copolymers or the incorporation of protein nanopores, respectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach using oxygen&#8208;producing enzymatic reactions within biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;p(CL&#8208;g&#8208;TMC)) polymersomes to modulate drug release. These polymersomes were found to enhance the release of hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic drugs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Semipermeable polymersomes, a class of polymeric vesicles that allow molecular passage across their membranes, offer significant potential for controlled drug delivery. These vesicles can be designed for inherent or selective permeability through the choice of suitable copolymers or the incorporation of protein nanopores, respectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach using oxygen-producing enzymatic reactions within biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(caprolactone-gradient-trimethylene carbonate) (PEG-p(CL-g-TMC)) polymersomes to modulate drug release. These polymersomes were found to enhance the release of hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic drugs. The enzymatic generation of oxygen within the polymersomes increased membrane hydrophobicity, influencing drug release kinetics. The findings highlight the importance of understanding drug release kinetics in designing effective drug delivery systems, as the release rate and mechanism critically impact therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Iminobismuthanes and Catalytic Reduction of Organic Azides via Bi(I)/Bi(III) Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of organobismuth(I) complexes with organic azides. Treatment of N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes with organic azides (acyl, sulfonyl, and bulky aryl) results in isolable monomeric iminobismuthanes which can be structurally characterized&#8212;including the formal Bi=N double bond&#8212;by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Building upon the stoichiometric reactivity of the monomeric iminobismuthanes, catalytic reduction of a broad range of organic azides is developed. DFT calculations of the catalytic reaction pathway support the redox nature of the overall process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials offer the potential to incorporate multiple functionalities, leveraging the aggregation effects of clusters and translating this heterogeneity and complexity into unexpected properties that are more than just the sum of their components. However, the rational construction of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials remains challenging due to the complexity of metal cation coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview provides insights into a general synthetic strategy based on Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory, summarizing its advantages in the designed synthesis of discrete heterometallic clusters (intracluster assembly) and infinite heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials (intercluster assembly). Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential to exploit the intrinsic properties of mixed components to achieve breakthroughs across a broad range of applications. The insights from this review are expected to drive the progress of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials in a controllable and predictable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Helical Organization in Supramolecular Polymers of Pseudo&#8208;Macrocyclic Tetrakisporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrakisporphyrin monomers with amino acid side chains at each end form intramolecular antiparallel hydrogen&#8208;bonds to adopt chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic structures that result in right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;conformations. The pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic tetrakisporphyrin monomers self&#8208;assembled to form supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers via head&#8208;to&#8208;head complementary dimerization of the bisporphyrin cleft units in an isodesmic manner. The formation of one&#8208;handed supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The methyl and iso&#8208;propyl groups at the stereogenic center greatly enhanced the induced circular dichroism (CD) in the Soret bands of the supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers. The induced CDs were reduced upon the introduction of large iso&#8208;butyl and tert&#8208;butyl groups. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;grown and long supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymer chains with chain lengths in the range of 361 to 13.6 nm. The right&#8208;handed helical chains were established by the self&#8208;assembly of the right&#8208;handed (P)&#8208;conformation of the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Peripheral Nitrogen Dopants in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the dopants situated near the metal site have demonstrated a significant impact on the catalytic properties. However, the effect of dopants situated further away from the metal centers and their working mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, we conduct density functional theory&#8208;driven studies on regulating the peripheral nitrogen dopants in graphene&#8208;based SACs, with a particular focus on Ir1 SAC, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is found that increasing the distance between the N dopant and the Ir1 site results in a different energy change for the reaction process compared to the dense doping model with only first and second&#8208;shell N species. The proposed stochastic doping models demonstrate statistically that increasing the N dopant in farther shells not only enhances the activity of Ir1 but also maintains a high selectivity for propene, which is verified by experimental tests. The modulation of the d&#8208;band center of Ir1 by stochastic N dopants effectively modifies the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby enabling the optimization of the potential energy surface of PDH. These results deepen the understanding of dopant states around metal sites and provide an important implication for the doping engineering in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Bonding Affinity with Multi&#8208;Intermediates via Interfacial Electron Capture to Boost Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant alkaline HER electrocatalysts is pivotal for sustainable energy, but co&#8208;regulating its intricate multi&#8208;step process, encompassing water dissociation, OH&#8208; desorption, and hydrogen generation, is still a great challenge. Herein, we tackle these obstacles by fabricating a vertically integrated electrode featuring a nanosheet array with prominent dual&#8208;nitride metallic heterostructures characterized by impeccable lattice matching and excellent conductivity, functioning as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst to fine&#8208;tune the bonding affinity &#160;with alkaline HER intermediates. Detailed structural characterization and theoretical calculation elucidate that charge redistribution at the heterointerface creates electron&#8208;accumulating W&#8208;W sites, which reduces the O p&#8208;W d and H s&#8208;W d interactions vs. single nitride, thereby enhancing OH&#8208; transfer and H2 release. As anticipated, the resulting WN&#8208;NiN/CFP catalyst demonstrates a gratifying low overpotential of 36.8 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; for alkaline HER, while concurrently maintaining&#160;operational stability for 1300 h at 100 mA/cm&#178; for overall water splitting. This work presents an effective approach to meticulously optimize multiple site&#8208;intermediate interactions in alkaline HER, laying the foundation for efficient energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8208;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late-stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)-2-aminooctadec-9-ene-1,3,8-triol, and to pursue further structure-activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base-sensing receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution of Frustrated Coordination in Eutectic Electrolyte Driven by Ligand Asymmetry toward High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eutectic electrolytes hold promise for aqueous zinc metal batteries in sustainable energy storage chemistries, yet improvement from perspective of molecule configurational engineering are ambiguous. Herein, we propose design strategy of increasing asymmetric molecular geometry in organic ligands to regulate frustrated coordination and disordered structure for eutectic electrolytes toward enhanced zinc metal batteries. The introduced asymmetry in eutectic component gives rise to relatively weak coordination strength and configurational disorder interaction among cation&#8208;anion&#8208;ligand, leading to suppressed local aggregation, steady eutectic phase and improved Zn2+&#160;diffusion kinetics. Such highly frustrated coordination state also enables disruption of hydrogen bonding network and reinforcement of anion participation, which results in confined side reactions, decreased water activity and the formation of inorganic&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase. In comparison to highly symmetric ligands, asymmetric ligand&#8208;involved eutectic electrolytes with configurational disorder&#160;deliver high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4 %, stabilized Zn plating/stripping of 5000 h and impressive rate capability even under harsh conditions such as small N/P, low temperature. The rationale in this work advances the deep understanding of asymmetric molecular engineering in eutectic electrolytes and showcases suitability of frustrated coordination to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth of Polycrystalline MOF Membranes on Cu Foils for Uniform Li Deposition in Long&#8208;life Anode&#8208;free Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery (AFLMB) is being developed as the next generation of advanced energy storage devices. However, the low plating and stripping reversibility of Li on Cu foil prevents its widespread application. A promising avenue for further improvement is to enhance the lithophilicity of Cu foils and optimise their surfaces through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) functional layer. However, excessive binder usage in the current approaches obscures the active plane of the MOF, severely limiting its performance. In response to this challenge, MOF polycrystalline membrane technology has been integrated into the field of AFLMB in this work. The dense and seamless HKUST&#8208;1 polycrystalline membrane was deposited on Cu foil (HKUST&#8208;1M@Cu) via an epitaxial growth strategy. In contrast to traditional MOF functional layers, this binder&#8208;free polycrystalline membrane fully exposes lithophilic sites, effectively reducing the nucleation overpotential and optimising the deposition quality of Li. Consequently, the Li plating layer becomes denser, eliminating the effects of dendrites. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the battery based on the HKUST&#8208;1 membrane exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability, achieving a high reversible capacity of approximately 160 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintaining a capacity retention of 80.9% after 1100 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystallization&#8208;Induced Red Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals formed through multicomponent self&#8208;assembly have attracted significant interest owing to their clear structure and tunable optical properties. However, most cocrystal systems suffer from inefficient long&#8208;wavelength emission and low phosphorescence efficiency due to strong non&#8208;radiative processes governed by the energy gap law. Herein, an efficient long&#8208;lived red afterglow is achieved using a pyrene (Py) cocrystal system incorporating a second component (NPYC4) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) properties. The cocrystal (NPYC4&#8208;Py) not only inherits the excellent luminescence of its monomeric counterparts, but also exhibits unique dual&#8208;mode characteristics, including persistent TADF and UOP emission with a high quantum yield of 58% and a lifetime of 362 ms. The precise cocrystal stacking distinctly reveals that intermolecular interactions lock the cocrystal formation and weaken the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between NPYC4 and Py, thereby stabilizing the excited triplet excitons. Furthermore, the favorable energy level of NPYC4 acts as a bridge, reducing the energy gap between the S1 and T1 states for Py, therefore activating its red phosphorescence from Py. This research provides direct insights into achieving efficient red UOP through co&#8208;crystallization.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Gene Expression System Using a Caging&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Photoactivatable Dye</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical regulation of transcription using chemical compounds is an effective strategy to manipulate gene expression spatiotemporally. Conventional caging approaches with photoremovable protecting groups may require intense UV&#8208;light exposure and release potentially toxic byproducts. To address these problems, here we developed a light&#8208;mediated transcriptional regulation system by combining a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye PaX560 and a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator QacR. The cationic dye generated from PaX560 through traceless photoconversion bound QacR and reduced its repressor function, resulting in transcriptional activation. Importantly, this system allowed transcriptional activation with a large dynamic range under mild visible light exposure and simultaneous detection of the state of the photoactivated effector. This module was integrated into the T7 RNA polymerase expression system to demonstrate light&#8208;activated transcription in vitro and in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Tuning Band Gaps of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Based MOFs Toward Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise adjusting the band gaps in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for improving their visible&#8208;light absorption capacity during photocatalysis, presenting both a formidable challenge and a charming opportunity. This present study employed a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy to pre&#8208;design six novel 4&#8208;connected ligands with systematic substituents (&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, &#8208;tBu, &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2) and synthesized the corresponding pillared&#8208;layer Zr&#8208;MOFs (NKM&#8208;668) retaining the hexaphenylbenzene fragment. Subsequently, the NKM&#8208;668 MOFs were transformed into large&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated hexabenzocoronene&#8208;based MOFs (pNKM&#8208;668) via the Scholl reaction. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41 eV (ranging from 3.25 eV to 1.84 eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold. This study not only enriches the type of hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based MOFs, but also paves the way for nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs in the further application of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Band Engineering of Mn&#8208;P Alloy Enables HER&#8208;suppressed Aqueous Manganese Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous manganese ion batteries hold potential for stationary storage applications owing to their merits in cost, energy density, and environmental sustainability. However, the formidable challenge is the instability of metallic manganese (Mn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes due to severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is more serious than the commonly studied Zn metal anodes. Moreover, the mechanism of HER side reactions has remained unclear. Herein, we design a series of Mn&#8208;P alloying anodes by precisely regulating their energy band structures to mitigate the HER issue. It is found that the serious HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the excessively high HOMO energy level of Mn, rather than electrocatalytic water splitting. Owing to a reduced HOMO energy level and enhanced electron escape work function, the MnP anode achieves an evidently enhanced cycle durability (over 1000 hours at a high current density of 5 mA cm&#8208;2). The MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 exhibits better rate capability and extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation than the cell using metallic Mn anode (less than 100 cycles). This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries</dc:description>

This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fentanyl Hapten&#8208;Displaying Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine that Non&#8208;Covalently Encapsulates a TLR7/8 Agonist and T&#8208;helper Epitope Induces Protective Anti&#8208;Fentanyl Immunity</title>

         <dc:description>Opioid use disorder &#8208; particularly involving fentanyl &#8208; has precipitated a public health crisis characterized by a significant increase in addiction and overdose&#8208;related deaths. Fentanyl&#8208;specific immunotherapy, which aims at inducing&#160;fentanyl&#8208;specific&#160;antibodies capable of binding fentanyl molecules in the bloodstream, preventing their entry in the central nervous system, is therefore gaining momentum.&#160;Conventional opioid designs&#160;rely on the covalent conjugation of fentanyl analogues to immunogenic carrier proteins that hold the inherent capacity of mounting immunodominant responses. Here, we present an alternative fentanyl vaccine design that utilizes a non&#8208;covalent assembly of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver fentanyl haptens in conjunction with a CD4+&#160;T&#8208;helper peptide epitope and an imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonist. Our results demonstrate that a single intramuscular administration of the LNP&#8208;based nanovaccine elicits fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies, significantly mitigating the effects of opioid overdose in preclinical mouse models. Furthermore, we analyzed the immunobiological behavior of the vaccine in vivo in mouse models, providing evidence that covalent attachment of a fentanyl hapten to a carrier proteins or peptide epitope is not necessary for inducing an effective immune response. However, co&#8208;delivery &#8208; specifically, the physical assembly of all immune cues into an LNP &#8208; remains essential for inducing hapten&#8208;specific immunity.</dc:description>

         <title>Standardized Parts for Activation of Small GTPase Signaling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a plug and play approach for the direct control of small GTPase activation in living cells. This approach is applied to the temporal control of filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, cell retraction, and MAPK signaling.







Abstract
Small GTPases comprise a superfamily of over 167 proteins in the human genome and are critical regulators of a variety of pathways including cell migration and proliferation. Despite the importance of these proteins in cell signaling, a standardized approach for controlling small GTPase activation within living cells is lacking. Herein, we report a split&#8208;protein&#8208;based approach to directly activate small GTPase signaling in living cells. Importantly, our fragmentation site can be applied across the small GTPase superfamily. We highlight the utility of these standardized parts by demonstrating the ability to directly modulate the activity of four different small GTPases with user&#8208;defined inputs, providing the first plug and play system for direct activation of small GTPases in living cells.

         <title>Dichloromethane as C1 Synthon for the Photoredox Catalytic Cyclopropanation of Aromatic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dichloromethane, an inexpensive C1 synthon, can be used with a nickel aminopyridine complex and iridium photocatalyst dual system to efficiently cyclopropanate aromatic olefins under mild conditions. This versatile methodology enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies highlight the role of the reduced nickel complex, facilitating homolytic Csp3&#8722;Cl bond cleavage and chloromethyl radical formation, captured by olefins.







Abstract
Dichloromethane, as a readily available and inexpensive C1 synthon is proposed as a powerful building block for cyclopropanation of alkenes under mild conditions. Herein, we report a highly efficient and versatile dual photoredox system, involving a nickel aminopyridine coordination complex and a photocatalyst, for the cyclopropanation of aromatic olefins using dichloromethane, under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The cyclopropanation protocol has been successfully applied at gram scale. Mechanistic studies suggest a Ni(II) pyridyl radical complex as the key intermediate for the homolytic cleavage of the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, generating a chloromethyl radical that is captured by the olefin coupling partner. Our findings also highlight the versatility of this methodology. By directing the radical/polar crossover process, we were able to selectively drive the reaction towards either the formation of cyclopropyl derivatives or the corresponding non&#8208;cyclic alkyl chloride products. The methodology also successfully apply to geminal dichloroalkanes, including the formation of spiro[2,2] compounds. Moreover, our methodology extends to the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled cyclopropanes, demonstrating its utility in isotopic labelling and broadening its applicability in chemical synthesis and drug development.

         <title>Third Metal Ion Dictates the Catalytic Activity of the Two&#8208;Metal&#8208;Ion Pre&#8208;Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Processing Machinery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;atom simulations suggest that a transient K+ ion at the catalytic site promotes catalysis in RNase mitochondrial RNA processing complex by rigidifying the active site and promoting proton transfer from the water nucleophile to the scissile phosphate. Conversely, the third Mg2+ ion captured in the experimental structure hinders catalysis by blocking the proton transfer and preventing the approach of the K+ ion.







Abstract
Nucleic acid processing enzymes use a two&#8208;Mg2+&#8208;ion motif to promote the formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Yet, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of spatially conserved second&#8208;shell cations surrounding the catalytic architecture of proteinaceous and RNA&#8208;dependent enzymes. The RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) complex, which cleaves the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor at the A3 cleavage site to yield mature 5&#8242;&#8208;end of 5.8S rRNA, hosts in the catalytic core one atypically&#8208;located Mg2+ ion, in addition to the ions forming the canonical catalytic motif. Here, we employ biased quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations of RNase MRP to discover that the third Mg2+ ion inhibits the catalytic process. Instead, its displacement in favour of a second&#8208;shell monovalent K+ ion propels phosphodiester bond cleavage by enabling the formation of a specific hydrogen bonding network that mediates the essential proton transfer step. This study points to a direct involvement of a transient K+ ion in the catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and implicates cation trafficking as a general mechanism in nucleic acid processing enzymes and ribozymes.

         <title>Coordination Environment and Distance Optimization of Dual Single Atoms on Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes was designed for an efficient and robust chlorine evolution reaction (CER) process. The prepared Pt DSAC exhibits excellent CER performance that outperforms that of the commercial dimensionally stable anode and Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst.







Abstract
The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anode reaction in the chlor&#8208;alkali industrial process. Precious metal&#8208;based dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) are commonly used as catalysts for CER but are constrained by their high cost and low selectivity. Herein, a Pt dual singe&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs) is designed for an efficient and robust CER process. The prepared Pt DSAC demonstrates excellent CER activity with a low overpotential of 21&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a remarkable mass activity of 3802.6&#8197;A&#8201;gpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential around 30&#8197;mV, outperforming those of commercial DSA and Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst. The excellent CER performance of Pt DSAC is attributed to the high atomic utilization and improved intrinsic activity. Notably, introducing fluorine atoms on CNTs increases the oxidation and chlorination resistance of Pt DSAC, and reduces the demetalization ratio of Pt atoms, resulting in excellent long&#8208;term CER stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that several Pt DSAC configurations with optimized first&#8208;shell ligands and interatomic distance display lower energy barriers for Cl intermediates generation and weaker ionic Pt&#8722;Cl bond interaction, which are favorable for the CER process.

Herein, a Pt dual singe-atom catalyst (DSAC) dispersed on fluorine-doped carbon nanotubes (F-CNTs) is designed for an efficient and robust CER process. The prepared Pt DSAC demonstrates excellent CER activity with a low overpotential of 21&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a remarkable mass activity of 3802.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an overpotential around 30&#8197;mV, outperforming those of commercial DSA and Pt single-atom catalyst. The excellent CER performance of Pt DSAC is attributed to the high atomic utilization and improved intrinsic activity. Notably, introducing fluorine atoms on CNTs increases the oxidation and chlorination resistance of Pt DSAC, and reduces the demetalization ratio of Pt atoms, resulting in excellent long-term CER stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that several Pt DSAC configurations with optimized first-shell ligands and interatomic distance display lower energy barriers for Cl intermediates generation and weaker ionic Pt&#8722;Cl bond interaction, which are favorable for the CER process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Self&#8208;Organized Chloro&#8208;Bridged Cubic Pd(II) Cage Showing Selective Encapsulation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise formation of a metal&#8208;chloride neutral cage has been shown to involve the initial pre&#8208;organization of the Pd3 subunits of a Pd6&#8208;hexamer mediated by a directional oxamide linker to a tetrameric Pd12 assembly followed by its conversion into a Pd12&#8208;tetrahedron and finally to a chloro&#8208;bridged Pd24 cube upon ligand substitution. The Pd24&#8208;cube shows selective encapsulation of phenolic guest molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis and guest recognition properties of a neutral Pd24&#8208;cubic cage, [{Pd3(NiPr)3PO}8(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)24] 1 are reported. The formation of the cubical assembly takes place by an exclusive one&#8208;pot ligand&#8208;assisted pathway directed by an oximido linker. The initial coordination of the oximido ligand pre&#8208;organizes the [Pd3(NiPr)3PO]3+ polyhedral building units into a tetrameric intermediate, which then transforms into an oximido&#8208;tethered tetrahedral assembly and to the cubical cage 1 in the presence of chloride ions. In the absence of the directing oximido linker, no cage formation was observed, and the Pd6&#8208;precursor was found to undergo self&#8208;condensation, giving rise to a new pentameric polyhedral cluster, [Pd5{(NiPr)3PO}2(OAc)2(OH)2] 2. The central cavity of the cube has been probed for guest encapsulation studies, which shows a high binding with phenolic guest molecules with association constants of the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The favorable formation of host&#8211;guest complexes was attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the host and guest functional groups.

         <title>Indazole to 2&#8208;Cyanoindole Scaffold Progression for Mycobacterial Lipoamide Dehydrogenase Inhibitors Achieves Extended Target Residence Time and Improved Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Cyanoindole Lpd inhibitors make critical contacts inside substrate lipoamide binding site to ensure induced fit tight binding and long residence time via Asn382 and Asn463. Asn463 is H&#8208;bonded with Tyr16 to maintain its favorable configuration. Mutations in any of these 3 residues lining the pocket result in inhibitor losing the induced fit interaction and long residence.







Abstract
Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide. Drug resistance to existing and even new antimycobacterials calls for research into novel targets and unexplored mechanisms of action. Recently we reported on the development of tight&#8208;binding inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), which selectively inhibit the bacterial but not the human enzyme based on a differential modality of inhibitor interaction with these targets. Here we report on the striking improvement in inhibitor residence time on the Mtb enzyme associated with scaffold progression from an indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole. Cryo&#8208;EM of Lpd with the bound 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitor 19 confirmed displacement of the buried water molecule deep in the binding channel with a cyano group. The ensuing hours&#8208;long improvement in on&#8208;target residence time is associated with enhanced antibacterial activity in axenic culture and in primary mouse macrophages. Resistance to 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitors involves mutations within the inhibitor binding site that have little effect on inhibitor affinity but change the modality of inhibitor&#8208;target interaction, resulting in fast dissociation from Lpd. These findings underscore that on&#8208;target residence time is a major determinant of antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Axial Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection by a Two&#8208;Dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection was achieved by using the multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric material BA2EA2Pb3I10 for the first time. It presents ultra&#8208;low detection limits along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis (19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) at zero bias, which was two orders of magnitude lower than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. However, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23&#8197;V and 0.22&#8197;V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Global Aromaticity of Aza&#8208;Superbenzene and Aza&#8208;Supernaphthalene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraazasuperbenzene (1) and a hexaazasupernaphthalene (2) were synthesized via a facile intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. The neutral compounds show localized aromaticity and slow dynamics, but their charged dications, tetracations and hexacations show global aromaticity or anti&#8208;aromaticity with &#960; electrons mainly delocalized along the outmost skeletons.







Abstract

         <title>Regulating the Scaling Relations in Ammonia Synthesis through a Light&#8208;Driven Bendable Seesaw Effect on Tailored Iron Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepped {110} surface of the prepared &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s exposes abundant C7 sites with moderate EN, achieving a delicate balance in scaling relations and thermal catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis. A novel light&#8208;induced &#8220;bendable seesaw effect&#8221; resulting from hot electron transfer between catalyst and adsorbates was discovered to regulate the scaling relations and further significantly enhances the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advancing the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process faces significant challenges due to the intrinsic constraints of scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we reported an approach of bending the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; to regulate the scaling relations over a tailored &#945;&#8208;Fe metallic material (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s), realizing highly efficient light&#8208;driven thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis with a rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without additional heating. Specifically, the thermal catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was significantly enhanced by the novel stepped {110} surface, exhibiting a 3.8&#8208;fold increase compared to the commercial fused&#8208;iron catalyst with promoters at 350&#8201;&#176;C. The photo&#8208;induced hot electron transfer further accelerates the dinitrogen dissociation and hydrogenation simultaneously, effectively overcoming the limitation of scaling relation over identical sites. Consequently, the ammonia production rate of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was further enhanced by 30&#8197;times at the same temperature with irradiation. This work designs an efficient and sustainable system for ammonia synthesis and provides a novel approach for regulating the scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization of Simple Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) system is reported that facilitates the direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to give substituted phenols. The process entails successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and leverages molecular oxygen from the air to drive the reaction cycle. This approach serves as a robust alternative to conventional synthetic methods.







Abstract
Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.

         <dc:description>
A crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated strategy was proposed, achieving desired Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, crosslinking, conjugation and steric hindrance factors were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission.







Abstract
Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emissions to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e., crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8722;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs but also helps understand the origin of NIR RTP to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.

         <title>Pyrolytic Depolymerization of Polyolefins Catalysed by Zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective UiO&#8208;66, a Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst, overcomes limitations in plastic waste depolymerization. During pyrolysis at 400&#8201;&#176;C, it promotes conversion of polyolefins to useful liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, reducing solid wax formation. This approach also offers a distinct catalytic pathway compared to conventional zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most&#8208;produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large&#8208;scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially&#8208;relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogeneous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO&#8208;66 MOFs containing coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated zirconium nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis&#8208;acidic UiO&#8208;66 nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yield aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic&#8208;rich hydrocarbons that can be obtained from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO&#8208;66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr&#8208;oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8722;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly&#8208;designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerisation of plastics, which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most-produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large-scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially-relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogeneous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO-66 MOFs containing coordinatively-unsaturated zirconium nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis-acidic UiO-66 nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yield aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic-rich hydrocarbons that can be obtained from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO-66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr-oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8722;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly-designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerisation of plastics, which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>

Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Redox Charge Carriers</title>

         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;free aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries were designed via matching Mn2+/MnO2 and S/Cu2S redox couplings, which exhibit high energy density and excellent cycling stability. These merits endow them with significant potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
The energy densities of conventional aqueous batteries are often unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of electrode materials. Therefore, the design of creative aqueous batteries has to be considered. Herein, aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries are constructed by matching S/Cu2S redox couples and MnO2 deposition/dissolution. In such batteries, S/Cu2S redox couples undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction with four&#8208;electron transfer, ensuring a high specific capacity of 2220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in S anodes. Furthermore, the conversion reaction of S/Cu2S redox couples can take place stably in acidic electrolyte that is essential for the MnO2 deposition/dissolution. As a result, the S/Cu2S redox couples can match MnO2 deposition/dissolution well, which endow the batteries with a membrane&#8208;free configuration. As a proof of concept, Ah&#8208;level prismatic and single&#8208;flow batteries were assembled and could operate stably for over 1000&#8197;h, demonstrating their great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. This work broadens the horizons of aqueous batteries beyond metal&#8208;manganese chemistry.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Dendrite&#8208;Free Flexible Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. This work offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.







Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. Hydrogel electrolytes present a compelling alternative to liquid electrolytes due to their remarkable flexibility and clear advantages in mitigating parasitic side reactions. However, hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.

Herein, a bio-inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network-repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite-free and long-life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose-modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti-corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long-term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy-related applications and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonds Based Reprogrammable and Re&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Elastomer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crosslinked LCE network based on metal&#8208;ligand bonds can achieve orientation programming of liquid crystal mesogen via partial stress relaxation. This programmed LCE maintains stable actuation even at elevated temperatures due to the high strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds comparable to traditional covalent bonds. The flexible and reversible nature of metal&#8208;ligand interactions also allows for the reprogramming of actuation behaviors and enables reprocessing and reshaping upon complete dissociation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonds endow liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with network rearrangeability, facilitating the fixation of mesogen alignment induced by external forces and enabling reversible actuation. In comparison, the bond exchange of supramolecular interactions is typically too significant to stably maintain the programmed alignment, particularly under intensified external stimuli. Nevertheless, remaking and recycling of supramolecular interaction&#8208;based polymer networks are more accessible than those based on dynamic covalent bonds, as the latter are difficult to completely dissociate. Thus, preparing an LCE that possesses both supramolecular&#8208;like exchangeability and covalent bond&#8208;level stability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we addressed this issue by employing metal&#8208;ligand bonds as the crosslinking points of LCE networks. As such, mesogen alignment can be repeatedly encoded through metal&#8208;ligand bond exchange and stably maintained after programming, since the bond exchange rate is sufficiently slow when the programming and actuation temperatures are below the bond dissociation temperature. More importantly, the metal&#8208;ligand bonds can be completely dissociated at high temperatures, allowing the LCE network to be dissolved in a solvent and reshaped into desired geometries via solution casting. Building on these properties, our LCEs can be fabricated into versatile actuators, such as reversible folding origami, artificial muscles, and soft robotics.

         <title>MOFite: A High&#8208;Density Lithiophilic and Scalable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Anode for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>

A salicylaldehydate&#8208;linked iron&#8208;based MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) was demonstrated as a scalable and high&#8208;performance pristine anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Furthermore, Fe&#8722;Tp has been explored as a performance enhancer for commercial graphite anodes in LIBs, highlighting its potential practical utility.







Abstract
Developing an anode material that has better performance efficiency than commercial graphite while keeping the features of economic scalability and environmental safety is highly desirable yet challenging. MOFs are a promising addition to the ongoing efforts, however, the relatively poor performance, chemical instability, and large&#8208;scale economic production of efficiency&#8208;proven pristine MOFs restrict their utility in real&#8208;life energy storage applications. Furthermore, hierarchical porosity for lucid mass diffusion, high&#8208;density lithiophilic sites are some of the structural parameters for improving the electrode performance. Herein, we have demonstrated the potential of economically scalable salicylaldehydate 3D&#8208;conjugated&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) as a high&#8208;performance anode in Li&#8208;ion batteries: the anode&#8208;specific capacity achieved up to 1447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 89&#8201;% of cyclic stability after 500&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for pristine MOF. More importantly, incorporating 10&#8201;% Fe&#8722;Tp doping in commercial graphite (MOFite) significantly enhanced lithium storage, doubling capacity after 400&#8197;cycles. It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8722;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.

         <title>Reductive Elimination From Tetra&#8208;Alkyl Cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;4): Beyond Simple Oxidation States</title>

         <dc:description>
The full series of high&#8208;valent cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722;, 0&#8804;n&#8804;4, has been studied by a combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations. The distinct reactivities observed can be attributed to subtle differences in the electronic structures of the complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, the electronic structures of organocuprates in general and the complex [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; in particular have attracted significant interest. A possible key indicator in this context is the reactivity of these species. Nonetheless, this aspect has received only limited attention. Here, we systematically study the series of tetra&#8208;alkyl cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; and their unimolecular reactivity in the gas phase, which includes concerted formal reductive eliminations as well as radical losses. Through computational studies, we characterize the electronic structures of the complexes and show how these are connected to their reactivity. We find that all [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; ions feature inverted ligand fields and that the distinct reactivity patterns of the individual complexes arise from the interplay of different effects.

         <title>Nonplanar Nanographene: A Hydrocarbon Hole&#8208;Transporting Material That Competes with Triarylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. A HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime as compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are essential for optoelectronic devices, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, and perovskite solar cells. Triarylamines have been employed as HTMs since they were introduced in 1987. However, heteroatoms or side chains embedded in the core skeleton of triarylamines can cause thermal and chemical stability problems. Herein, we report that hexabenzo[a,c,fg,j,l,op]tetracene (HBT), a small nonplanar nanographene, functions as a hydrocarbon HTM with hole transport properties that match those of triarylamine&#8208;based HTMs. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and theoretical calculations revealed effective multidirectional orbital interactions and transfer integrals for HBT. In&#8208;depth experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the nonplanarity&#8208;inducing annulative &#960;&#8208;extension can achieve not only a stable amorphous state in bulk films, but also a higher increase in the highest occupied molecular orbital level than conventional linear or cyclic &#960;&#8208;extension. Furthermore, an in&#8208;house manufactured HBT&#8208;based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime compared to those of representative triarylamine&#8208;based OLEDs. A notable improvement in device lifetime was observed for the HBT&#8208;based OLED, highlighting the advantages of the hydrocarbon HTM. This study demonstrates the immense potential of small nonplanar nanographenes for optoelectronic device applications.

Furthermore, an in-house manufactured HBT-based OLED exhibited excellent performance, featuring superior curves for current density&#8211;voltage, external quantum efficiency&#8211;luminance, and lifetime compared to those of representative triarylamine-based OLEDs. A notable improvement in device lifetime was observed for the HBT-based OLED, highlighting the advantages of the hydrocarbon HTM. This study demonstrates the immense potential of small nonplanar nanographenes for optoelectronic device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Self&#8208;Sorting Behaviours of Metallacages with Subtle Structural Differences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we elucidated the unusual and efficient self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. The volume confinement and efficient mixing effects within microdroplets accelerate the self&#8208;sorting of metallacages in microdroplets compared to the same self&#8208;sorting in batch reactors.







Abstract
Investigating the self&#8208;sorting behaviour of assemblies with subtle structural differences is a captivating yet challenging endeavour. Herein, we elucidate the unusual self&#8208;sorting behaviour of metallacages with subtle structural differences in batch reactors and microdroplets. Narcissistic self&#8208;sorting of metallacages has been observed for two ligands with identical sizes, shapes, and symmetries, with only minor differences in the substituted groups. In particular, the self&#8208;sorting process in microdroplets occurs within 1&#8197;min at room temperature, in stark contrast to batch reactors, which require equilibration for 30&#8197;min. To reveal the mechanism of self&#8208;sorting and the role of microdroplets, we conducted a series of experiments and theoretical calculations, including competitive self&#8208;assembly, cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation, control experiments involving model metallacages with larger cavities, noncovalent interaction analysis, and root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis. This research demonstrates an unusual case of self&#8208;sorting of very similar assemblies and provides a new strategy for facilitating the self&#8208;sorting efficiency of supramolecular systems.

         <title>Heteroatoms&#8208;Stabilized Single Palladium Atoms on Amorphous Zeolites: Breaking the Tradeoff between Catalytic Activity and Selectivity for Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on heteroatom (B, Al, or Ga)&#8208;containing amorphous zeolite, achieves the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, demonstrating a recorded turnover frequency value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high styrene selectivity (95&#8201;%).







Abstract
As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on boron&#8208;containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Advanced characterizations and theoretical density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporated B atoms in the Pd/AZ&#8722;B can not only alter the geometric and electronic properties of Pd atoms by controlling the electron migration from Pd but also mitigate the interaction between alkene and the catalyst supports. This boosts the exceptional catalytic efficacy in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene under mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), achieving a recorded turnover frequency (TOF) value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and demonstrating 95&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at full conversion of phenylacetylene. By comparison, the heteroatom&#8208;free amorphous zeolite&#8208;anchored Pd nanoparticles and the commercial Lindlar catalyst have styrene selectivities of 73&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. This work establishes a solid foundation for developing highly active and selective hydrogenation catalysts by controllably optimizing their electronic and steric properties.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Gradient Interface for High&#8208;Rate PEO&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic gradient SEI layer (SCG&#8208;SEI) exhibits a low nucleation overpotential along with strong mechanical strength, enabling rapid Li+ diffusion and electron conduction. This synergistic effect facilitates the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, thus ensuring excellent cells performance even under ultra&#8208;high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and high current density (5&#8197;C).







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are strongly hindered by the fast dendrite growth at the Li metal/electrolyte interface, especially under large rates. The above issue stems from the suboptimal interfacial chemistry and poor Li+ transport kinetics during cycling. Herein, a SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SCG&#8208;SEI) of LixSny/LiF&#8208;Li2O is in situ formed. The superior ionic LiF&#8208;Li2O rich upper layer (17.1&#8197;nm) possesses high interfacial energy and fast Li+ diffusion channels, wherein lithiophilic LixSny alloy layer (8.4&#8197;nm) could highly reduce the nucleation overpotential with lower diffusion barrier and promote rapid electron transportation for reversible Li+ plating/stripping. Simultaneously, the insoluble SnF2&#8208;coordinated PEO promotes the rapid Li+ ion transport in the bulk phase. As a result, an over 46.7 and 3.5&#8197;times improvements for lifespan and critical current density of symmetrical cells are achieved, respectively. Furthermore, LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLMBs deliver a recorded cycling performance at 5&#8197;C (over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.0&#8201;%). More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and pouch cell with LiFePO4, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100&#8201;&#176;C), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high&#8208;rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;Modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IEIs between Ag and Co3O4 significantly strengthen NO3&#8722; adsorption and stabilize CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4, while suppressing H2 production. The synergistic effect of multiple active sites realizes tandem catalysis: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites whereas NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to NH3 at Co sites.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86&#8201;%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11&#8201;%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100&#8201;%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81&#8197;times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high-efficiency electrode Ag-modified Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Ag&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86&#8201;%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11&#8201;%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100&#8201;%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co/CC is ~81&#8197;times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which stabilize the CoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedrons within Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) as well as intermediates (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high-performance NRA electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Formation Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Carbonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the formation mechanism of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) by exploring the effect of crosslinking on the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are revealed, and the higher crosslinking degree can also bring a higher carbonization degree to realize the regulation of photoluminescence.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom&#8208;up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

While organic polymers offer a robust and adaptable framework that is well&#8208;suited for APB electrodes, the limited proton&#8208;storage redox capacity has constrained their broader application. Herein, a ladder&#8208;type polymer (PNMZ) has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy that exhibits optimized electronic structure and fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport within the high&#8208;aromaticity polymeric skeleton. As a result, the polymer exhibits exceptional proton&#8208;storage redox kinetics, which are evidenced by in&#8208;operando monitoring techniques and theoretical calculations. It achieves a remarkable proton&#8208;storage capacity of 189&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, with approximately 97.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 10,000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoester and 1,3&#8208;Diol to Access Chemically Recyclable and Mechanically Robust Poly(vinyl alcohol) Thermosets through Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high&#8208;performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, followed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction with 1,3&#8208;diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross&#8208;linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.







Abstract
The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with &#946;&#8208;ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross&#8208;linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. The cross&#8208;linking architecture improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, i.e. approximately 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&gt;90&#8201;%) of PVA. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.

&lt;p&gt;&#946;-(1,3-dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high-performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;-ketoesters, followed by the cross-linking reaction with 1,3-diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross-linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;-(1,3-dioxane)ester (&lt;b&gt;DXE&lt;/b&gt;) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst-free reaction of &#946;-ketoester and 1,3-diol, to cross-link poly(vinyl alcohol) (&lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;) for the formation of high-performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;, modified with &#946;-ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross-linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3-diols within &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; itself upon thermal treatment. The cross-linking architecture improves &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. approximately 3- and 12-fold those of linear &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross-linked &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&amp;gt;90&#8201;%) of &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross-linked &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;-based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross-linked by the &lt;b&gt;DXE&lt;/b&gt; linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; and the fillers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Low&#8208;loaded PdOx/AlSiOx Catalyst for Ethylene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Pd(II) sites anchored by vicinal hydroxyls of Al2O3&#8722;SiO2 support possess unexpectedly high activity for ethylene dimerization. The fundamentals of catalyst performance were elucidated by combining catalytic experiments, in situ catalyst characterization, and DFT calculations. The developed catalyst was successfully applied for direct synthesis of propylene from ethylene by rational integration of dimerization and metathesis reactions.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is an industrial process that is currently carried out using homogeneous catalysts. Here we present a highly active heterogeneous catalyst containing minute amounts of atomically dispersed Pd. It requires no co&#8208;catalyst(s) or activator(s) and significantly outperforms previously reported catalysts tested under similar reaction conditions. The selectivity to C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;hydrocarbons was about 80&#8201;% and 10&#8201;% at 42&#8201;% ethylene conversion at 200&#8201;&#176;C using an industrially relevant feed containing 50&#8197;vol&#8201;% ethylene, respectively. Our kinetic and catalyst characterization experiments complemented by density functional theory calculations provide molecular insights into the local environment of isolated Pd(II)Ox species and their role in achieving high activity in the target reaction. When the developed catalyst was rationally integrated with a Mo&#8208;containing olefin metathesis catalyst in the same reactor, the formed butenes reacted with ethylene to propylene with a selectivity of 98&#8201;% at about 24&#8201;% ethylene conversion.

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful polymerization of water, isocyanide, and chlorooxime was established toward polyamide with a novel modifiable architecture. Through hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction, emissive units were introduced to the polyamide, which emission colors could range from blue to red. The refractive index (n) of polyamides was also significantly improved and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53 900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.

A superior oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte is designed to conquer the high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich lithium metal batteries. Our electrolyte demonstrates superb compatibility with both lithium metal anode and NCM811 cathode at even 4.8&#8197;V. We validate a 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li||NCM811 pouch cell with energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pioneeringly, highlighting the practical potential of our electrolyte.







Abstract
Combining high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes with lithium metal anodes is among the most promising approaches for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. However, most current electrolytes fail to simultaneously satisfy the compatibility requirements for the lithium metal anode and the tolerance for the ultra&#8208;high voltage NCM811 cathode. Here, we have designed an ultra&#8208;oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte by meticulously adjusting the composition of fluorinated carbonates. Our study reveals that a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in LiF and Li2O is constructed on the lithium anode through the synergistic decomposition of the fluorinated solvents and PF6&#8722; anion, facilitating smooth lithium metal deposition. The superior oxidation resistance of our electrolyte enables the Li||NCM811&#8197;cell to deliver a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at an ultrahigh cut&#8211;off voltage of 4.8&#8197;V. Additionally, a pioneering 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 stably cycles for 110&#8197;cycles under harsh conditions of high cathode loading (30&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), low N/P ratio (1.18), and lean electrolytes (2.3&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1).

         <title>Improved Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis through Hydrogen Poisoning Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen poisoning effects over NiCoP@CC occurring at low overpotentials can leave behind catalytically inert poisoned HI* at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereby create ideally reactive HII*. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for HER was suppressed due to catalytic inertia of HI* and thereby NITRR was timely initiated through HII* owing to ideal hydrogenation reactivity of HII*. As a result, a record high NH3 production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion from nitrate to ammonia is a key step in sustainable ammonia production.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen poisoning effects over NiCoP@CC occurring at low overpotentials can leave behind catalytically inert poisoned H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;* at Co-hollow sites and thereby create ideally reactive H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;*. The dimerization between H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;* and H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;* for HER was suppressed due to catalytic inertia of H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;* and thereby NITRR was timely initiated through H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;* owing to ideal hydrogenation reactivity of H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;*. As a result, a record high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved at low energy consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical conversion from nitrate to ammonia is a key step in sustainable ammonia production. However, it suffers from low productive efficiency or high energy consumption due to a lack of desired electrocatalysts. Here we report nickel cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) catalysts for nitrate-to-ammonia electrocatalysis that display a record-high catalytic current density of &#8722;702&#177;7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ammonia production rate of 5415&#177;26&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Faraday efficiency of 99.7&#177;0.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, affording the estimated energy consumption as low as 22.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;ammonia&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that these catalysts benefit from hydrogen poisoning effects, which leave behind catalytically inert adsorbed hydrogen species (H&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;*) at Co-hollow sites and thereupon enable ideally reactive H&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;* at secondary Co&#8722;P sites.

         <title>Stable Meisenheimer Complexes as Powerful Photoreductants Readily Obtained from Aza&#8208;Hetero Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong reducing systems (&#8804;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE) can be obtained simply and practically by adding nBuLi to available heterocyclic compounds (pyridine, isoquinoline, etc) and using them under irradiation at 456&#8197;nm. Strong photoreductans obtained are capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich arylchlorides.







Abstract
Excited states of radical anions derived from the photoreduction of stable organic molecules are suggested to serve as potent reductants. However, excited states of these species are too short&#8208;lived to allow bimolecular quenching processes. Recently, the singlet excited state of Meisenheimer complexes, which possess a long&#8208;lived excited state, was identified as the competent species for the reduction of challenging organic substrates (&#8722;2.63&#8197;V vs. SCE, saturated calomel electrode). To produce reasonably stable and simply accessible different Meisenheimer complexes, the addition of nBuLi to readily available aromatic heterocycles was investigated, and the photoreactivity of the generated species was studied. In this paper, we present the straightforward preparation of a family of powerful photoreductants (*Eox&lt;&#8722;3&#8197;V vs. SCE in their excited states, determined by DFT and time&#8208;dependent TD&#8208;DFT calculations; DFT, density functional theory) that can induce dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides and to form C&#8722;C bond through radical cyclization. Photophysical analyses and computational studies in combination with experimental mechanistic investigations demonstrate the ability of the adduct to act as a strong electron donor under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Toggling the Oxygen Affinity between Anthracenes and Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen reacts selectively with pyridylanthracenes or naphthalenes, allowing switching between both units in a dyad. Four different stages can be addressed by a combination of protonation, oxidation, and thermolysis. Furthermore, optical spectroscopy offers a simple read&#8208;out method.







Abstract
We present the design of an anthracenyl&#8211;naphthyl (ANT&#8208;NAPH) dyad and its application as a luminescent 4&#8208;stage photo switch. Both segments can individually react with singlet oxygen to switch off an optical response. In their initial form the larger ANT component reacts significantly faster and thus an ANTO2&#8208;NAPH stage is turned on, observed by optical response of the remaining NAPH. To reduce its reactivity, ANT is substituted with two pyridine rings. This concept is first investigated and quantified on ANT and NAPH as separated molecules. Upon protonation the reaction of ANT becomes significantly slower. For the three possible pyridyl isomers this effect increases along the order meta&lt;para&lt;ortho. With the pyridyl nitrogen in ortho position the reaction completely toggles from ANT to NAPH. Application of this concept on the dyad allows to turn on the ANT&#8208;NAPHO2 stage with optical response of the remaining ANT. The sequence of protonation&#8208;oxygenation&#8208;neutralization is thereby the only possible way to isolate the unfavored form ANT&#8208;NAPHO2. In the dyad ANT and NAPH are directly attached and their coupling constitutes a non&#8208;oxygenated third stage, where the NAPH luminescence is quenched and ANT luminescence is enhanced. Reaction of both NAPH and ANT to ANTO2&#8208;NAPHO2 constitutes the fourth dark stage.

         <title>Stereodivergency in Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Difunctionalizations: The Impact of Boron Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent borylative difunctionalization strategy is reported. The key component in obtaining stereodivergence lies in the Lewis acidity of the introduced boron group. The more Lewis acidic Bpin group enables chelation control affording an all cis diastereomer. Conversely, the less acidic Bdan group overrides this preference by disfavouring adduct formation, leading to a bifurcation in the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A reagent&#8208;controlled diastereodivergent copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative difunctionalization is reported. The formation of Lewis adducts that guide selectivity is commonly invoked in organic reaction mechanisms. Using density functional theory calculations, we identified BpinBdan as a sterically similar and less Lewis acidic alternative to B2pin2. Using a newly developed borylative aldol domino reaction as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate a change in stereochemical outcome by a simple change of borylating reagent&#8212;B2pin2 affords the diastereomer associated with coordination control while BpinBdan overturns this mode of binding. We show that this strategy can be generalized to other scaffolds and, more importantly, that BpinBdan does not alter the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction when coordination is not involved. BpinBdan can be viewed as a mechanistic probe for coordination in future copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation reactions.

         <title>Porous Organic Cage as an Efficient Platform for Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cage (POC) was firstly developed as an efficient platform for industrial radioactive iodine capture, which provides a new insight for sufficiently utilizing binding sites. The constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, extraordinary adsorption capacity of unitionic sites (1.62 I2/ionic sites), and remarkable kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1).







Abstract
Herein, we firstly develop porous organic cage (POC) as an efficient platform for highly effective radioactive iodine capture under industrial operating conditions (typically &#8805;150&#8201;&#176;C), &#8804;150&#8197;ppmv of I2). Due to the highly dispersed and readily accessible binding sites as well as sufficient accommodating space, the constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;) (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake capacity of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;% and extraordinary adsorption capacity of unit ionic site (~1.62) at 150&#8201;&#176;C and 150&#8197;ppmv of I2. The I2 capacity is 3.5, 1.6, and 1.3&#8197;times higher than industrial silver&#8208;based adsorbents Ag@MOR and benchmark materials of TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the same conditions. Furthermore, NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me exhibits remarkable adsorption kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1), which is 1.2 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the identical conditions. NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me thus sets a new benchmark for industrial radioactive I2 adsorbents.

&lt;p&gt;Porous organic cage (POC) was firstly developed as an efficient platform for industrial radioactive iodine capture, which provides a new insight for sufficiently utilizing binding sites. The constructed NKPOC-DT-(I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)Me (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record-high I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, extraordinary adsorption capacity of unitionic sites (1.62 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ionic sites), and remarkable kinetics (k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0.013&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we firstly develop porous organic cage (POC) as an efficient platform for highly effective radioactive iodine capture under industrial operating conditions (typically &#8805;150&#8201;&#176;C), &#8804;150&#8197;ppmv of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Due to the highly dispersed and readily accessible binding sites as well as sufficient accommodating space, the constructed NKPOC-DT-(I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record-high I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;% and extraordinary adsorption capacity of unit ionic site (~1.62) at 150&#8201;&#176;C and 150&#8197;ppmv of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity is 3.5, 1.6, and 1.3&#8197;times higher than industrial silver-based adsorbents Ag@MOR and benchmark materials of TGDM and 4F-iCOF-TpBpy-I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; under the same conditions. Furthermore, NKPOC-DT-(I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)Me exhibits remarkable adsorption kinetics (k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0.013&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is 1.2 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than TGDM and 4F-iCOF-TpBpy-I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; under the identical conditions.

         <title>Mesoporous Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom&#8208;Tuned Crystallinity and Photocatalytic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three mesoporous vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) derived from a methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer were built up by Knoevenagel condensation. Their crystallinity and semiconducting properties could be fine tuned by embedding heteroatoms into the backbones, which resulted in significantly different visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activities.







Abstract
Owing to its prominent &#960;&#8208;delocalization and stability, vinylene linkage holds great merits in the construction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with promising semiconducting properties. However, carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction always exhibits relatively low reversibility, unfavorable for the formation of high crystalline frameworks through self&#8208;error correction and assembling processes. In this work, we report a heteroatom&#8208;tuned strategy to build up a series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;deficient methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer with different triformyl substituted (hetero&#8722;)aromatic derivatives. The resulting COFs show high&#8208;quality periodic mesoporous structures with high surface areas. Embedding heteroatoms into the backbones enables significantly improving their crystallinity, and finely tailoring their semiconducting structures. Upon visible light stimulation, one of the as&#8208;prepared COFs with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure could deliver a nearly seven&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of hydrogen generation as compared with the other two. Meanwhile, in combination with high crystallinity and the matched conduction band energy level, such kind of COFs can be able to selectively generate singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals in a high ratio of up to 30&#8201;:&#8201;1, allowing for catalyzing aerobic thioanisole oxidation in distinctly tunable activities through the substituent electronic effect of the substrates.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Co&#8208;Conversions of PBS Waste Plastics and Maleic Acid into High&#8208;Purity Succinic Acid Solid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free co&#8208;production system was devised to produce succinic acid (SA) at both anode and cathode respectively by the co&#8208;electrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) waste plastics and biomass&#8208;derived maleic acid (MA). The high&#8208;purity SA solid can be obtained by a carbon dioxide&#8208;assisted sequential precipitation approach.







Abstract
Plastic pollution, an increasingly serious global problem, can be addressed through the full lifecycle management of plastics, including plastics recycling as one of the most promising approaches. System design, catalyst development, and product separation are the keys in improving the economics of electrocatalytic plastics recycling. Here, a membrane&#8208;free co&#8208;production system was devised to produce succinic acid (SA) at both anode and cathode respectively by the co&#8208;electrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) waste plastics and biomass&#8208;derived maleic acid (MA) for the first time. To this end, Cr3+&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst featuring much enhanced 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) oxidation reaction (BOR) activity has been synthesized and the role of doped Cr has been revealed as an &#8220;electron puller&#8221; to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Ni2+/Ni3+ cycling. Impressively, an extra&#8208;high SA production rate of 3.02&#8197;g&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;high apparent Faraday efficiency towards SA (FEapparent=181.5&#8201;%) have been obtained. A carbon dioxide&#8208;assisted sequential precipitation approach has been developed to produce high&#8208;purity SA and byproduct NaHCO3 solids. Preliminary techno&#8208;economic analysis demonstrates that the reported system is economically profitable and promising for future industrial applications.

         <title>Halogen Bond Unlocks Ultra&#8208;High Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halogen aliovalent substitution of the Cl&#8722; anion with a I+ cation results in the formation of an [O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N] halogen bond, which then bridges &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups to form a novel halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular framework, INA. This crystal exhibits a record&#8208;high birefringence (&#916;nexp.=0.778@550&#8197;nm), making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance optical devices such as polarizers, isolators, and phase retarders.







Abstract
Anisotropy is crucial for birefringence (&#916;n) in optical materials, but optimizing it remains a formidable challenge (&#916;n &gt;0.3). Supramolecular frameworks incorporating &#960;&#8208;conjugated components are promising for achieving enhanced birefringence because of their structural diversity and inherent anisotropy. Herein, we first synthesized (C6H6NO2)+Cl&#8722; (NAC) and then constructed a halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular framework I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722; (INA) by halogen aliovalent substitution of Cl&#8722; with I+. The organic moieties are protonated and deprotonated nicotinic acid (NA), respectively. The antiparallel arrangement of birefringent&#8208;active units in NAC and INA leads to significant differences in the bonding characteristics between the interlayer and intralayer domains. Moreover, the [O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N] halogen bond in 1D [I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722;] chain exhibits stronger interactions and stricter directionality, resulting in a more pronounced in&#8208;plane anisotropy between the intrachain and interchain directions. Consequently, INA exhibits exceptional birefringent performance, with a value of 0.778 at 550&#8197;nm, twice that of NAC (0.363 at 550&#8197;nm). This value significantly exceeds those of commercial birefringent crystals, such as CaCO3 (0.172 at 546&#8197;nm), and is the highest reported value among ultraviolet birefringent crystals. This work presents a novel design strategy that employs halogen bonds as connection sites and modes for birefringent&#8208;active units, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.

Frenkel and charge&#8208;transfer excitonic couplings at donor:acceptor interfaces strengthened by 2&#8208;chlorothiophene (2Cl&#8722;Th) solvent promote exciton splitting and reduce non&#8208;radiative voltage loss in organic solar cells. Finally, in 2Cl&#8722;Th treated cells, the champion efficiencies of 19.8&#8201;% (small&#8208;area) with superior operational reliability (T80: 586&#8197;hours) and 17.0&#8201;% (large&#8208;area) were yielded.







Abstract
Overcoming the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuited current (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuited voltage (Voc) is important to achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Previous works modulated the energy gap between Frenkel local exciton (LE) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) exciton, which served as the driving force of exciton splitting. Differently, our current work focuses on the modulation of LE&#8208;CT excitonic coupling (tLE&#8208;CT) via a simple but effective strategy that the 2&#8208;chlorothiophene (2Cl&#8722;Th) solvent utilizes in the treatment of OSC active&#8208;layer films. The results of our experimental measurements and theoretical simulations demonstrated that 2Cl&#8722;Th solvent initiates tighter intermolecular interactions with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor in comparison with that of traditional chlorobenzene solvent, thus suppressing the acceptor's over&#8208;aggregation and retarding the acceptor crystallization with reduced trap. Critically, the resulting shorter distances between donor and acceptor molecules in the 2Cl&#8722;Th treated blend efficiently strengthen tLE&#8208;CT, which not only promotes exciton splitting but also reduces non&#8208;radiative recombination. The champion efficiencies of 19.8&#8201;% (small&#8208;area) with superior operational reliability (T80: 586&#8197;hours) and 17.0&#8201;% (large&#8208;area) were yielded in 2Cl&#8722;Th treated cells. This work provided a new insight into modulating the exciton dynamics to overcome the trade&#8208;off between Jsc and Voc, which can productively promote the development of the OSC field.

         <title>Facilitating Formate Selectivity via Optimizing eg* Band Broadening in NiMn Hydroxides for Ethylene Glycol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, structural distortions in Ni(OH)2 induced by Mn doping can effectively modulate its electronic states around the Fermi level. It was found that Mn doping could lead to the broadening of eg* band, which enhanced the performance of EGOR. Product analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the adsorption of key intermediates of glyoxal was enhanced by eg* band broadening, resulting in the formate selectivity enhancement and inhibition of Cannizzaro reaction that generating glycolate by&#8208;product. These insights into the electronic state regulation of catalysts significantly advance the design of highly selective and efficient Ni(OH)2&#8208;based electrocatalysts, paving the way for future innovations in the development of electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (EGOR) on nickel&#8208;based hydroxides (Ni(OH)2) represents a promising strategy for generating value&#8208;added chemicals, i.e. formate and glycolate, and coupling water&#8208;electrolytic hydrogen production. The high product selectivity was one of the most significant area of polyols electro&#8208;oxidation process. Yet, developing Ni(OH)2&#8208;based EGOR electrocatalyst with highly selective product remains a challenge due to the unclear cognition about the EGOR mechanism. Herein, Mn&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 catalysts were utilized to investigate the EGOR mechanism. Experimental and calculation results reveal that the electronic states of eg* band play an important role in the catalytic performance and the product selectivity for EGOR. Broadening the eg* band could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of glyoxal intermediates. On the other hand, this enhanced adsorption could lead to reduced side reactions associated with glycolate formation, simultaneously promoting the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds. Consequently, the selectivity for formate was notably augmented by these enhancements. This work offers new insights into the regulation of catalyst electronic states for improving polyol electrocatalytic activity and product selectivity.

         <title>Redox Concomitant Formation Method for Fabrication of Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/Polymer Composites with Antifouling Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) is presented for the fabrication of Cu(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy) composite. The monomer, as a molecular scalpel, reduces Cu(II) sites into Cu(I) sites while polymerizing as molecular sutures protecting in situ phase transition. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions and exceptional photothermal ability, Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy exhibits superior antifouling properties.







Abstract
Marine biofouling, which is one of the technical challenges hindering the growth of the marine economy, has been controlled using cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles due to the exceptional antifouling properties of Cu(I) ions. However, Cu2O nanoparticles have encountered bottlenecks due to explosive releases of Cu+ ions, high toxicity at elevated doses, and long&#8208;term instability. Here, we present a novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) for fabricating a hierarchical Cu(I) metal&#8211;organic framework polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy) composite. This method enables in situ phase transition via successive redox reactions that change the chemical valence state and coordination mode of Cu(II)&#8722;MOF, resulting in a new structure of Cu(I)&#8722;MOF while creating a PPy layer surrounded by the hierarchical structure. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions from the Cu(I) sites and photothermal properties of PPy, Cu(I)&#8722;MOF/PPy exhibits superior and broad&#8208;spectrum resistance to marine bacteria, algae, and surface&#8208;adhered biofilms in complex biological environments, as well as long&#8208;term stability, resulting in 100&#8201;% eradication efficiency under solar&#8208;driven heating. Mechanistic insights into successive structural redox reactions and formation using the RCF method are provided in detail, enabling the fabrication of novel MOFs with the desired composition and structure for a wide range of potential applications.

         <title>Hidden Impurities Generate False Positives in Single Atom Catalyst Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>

The research addresses a critical issue in the characterization of single&#8208;atom catalysts, namely the challenge of correctly identifying and distinguishing impurities and active sites at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are an emerging class of materials, leveraging maximum atom utilization and distinctive structural and electronic properties to bridge heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Direct imaging methods, such as aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, are commonly applied to confirm the atomic dispersion of active sites. However, interpretations of data from these techniques can be challenging due to simultaneous contributions to intensity from impurities introduced during synthesis processes, as well as any variation in position relative to the focal plane of the electron beam. To address this matter, this paper presents a comprehensive study on two representative SACs containing isolated nickel or copper atoms. Spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, were employed to prove the high metal dispersion of the catalytic atoms. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging combined with single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, we scrutinized thin specimens of the catalysts to provide an unambiguous chemical identification of the observed single&#8208;atom species and thereby distinguish impurities from active sites at the single&#8208;atom level. Overall, the study underscores the complexity of SACs characterization and establishes the importance of the use of spectroscopy in tandem with imaging at atomic resolution to fully and reliably characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts.

Cell vesicles displaying high&#8208;mannose modified anti&#8208;CD47 nanobody enable the boost of macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity for enhanced cancer suppression by synergizing the checkpoint blockade and glycan&#8208;mediated interactions.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis represents an alluring avenue for cancer immunotherapy. However, the compromised efficacy and safety concerns in vivo of conventional anti&#8208;CD47 antibodies impede their wide clinical applications. Here we introduced a single type of high&#8208;mannose glycans into the nanobody against CD47 (HM&#8208;nCD47) and subsequently displayed HM&#8208;nCD47 on cellular vesicles (CVs) for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. In this platform, the CVs significantly improved the circulation time of HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs, the nCD47 enabled the blockade of the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis, and the HM enhanced recognition of mannose&#8208;binding lectin, all synergistically activating the macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. In both subcutaneous and metastatic murine tumor models, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs possessed significantly extended half&#8208;lives and increased accumulation at the tumor site, resulting in a remarkable macrophage&#8208;dependent inhibition of tumor growth, a transcriptomic remodeling of the immune response, and an increase in survival time. By integrating the chemical biology toolbox with cell membrane nanotechnology, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs represent a new immunotherapeutic platform for cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Development of Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles with Low Immunogenicity and Their Application in the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low immunogenicity were developed as novel gene delivery platforms by incorporating Dex (dLNPs) to alleviate side effects induced by traditional LNPs. Lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs delivered siRUNX1 for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with superior therapeutic performance owing to the synergy of gene and drug therapy. They provide a blueprint for the design of RNA therapeutics with higher efficacy and safety.







Abstract
As the most advanced non&#8208;viral delivery system, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were approved by the FDA, propelling the advancements of gene therapy. However, their clinical applications are hampered by the potential immunogenicity of the lipid components that trigger immune&#8208;related adverse events, like inflammation and allergy. Herein, we formulate various dLNPs with diminished immunogenicity by incorporating dexamethasone (Dex) into liver&#8208;, spleen&#8208;, and lung&#8208;targeting LNPs formulations that exhibit excellent abilities to target specific organs and deliver various types of RNA, such as mRNA and siRNA. In vivo investigations demonstrate unparalleled advantages in safety as compared to conventional LNPs, showing promising potential in the development of RNA therapeutics. Intriguingly, the encapsulation of runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 siRNA (siRUNX1) into lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs (dLNPs@siRUNX1) demonstrates remarkable advantages in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis through the synergy of gene therapy and drug therapy. This research establishes secure and universal platforms for the precise delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, showcasing promising clinical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>Modulating the Bader Charge Transfer in Single p&#8208;Block Atoms Doped Pd Metallene for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the Bader charge transfer between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates (*OO) via p&#8208;d electronic interaction on single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal doped Pd metallene (M&#8722;Pd metallene, M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) with only 4&#8211;5 atomic layers thickness enable efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Metallene is considered as an emerging family of electrocatalysts due to its atomically layered structure and unique surface stress. Here we propose a strategy to modulate the Bader charge transfer (BCT) between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates via p&#8208;d electronic interaction by introducing single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal (M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) into Pd metallene nanosheets towards efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that doping p&#8208;block metals could facilitate electron transfer to Pd sites and thus downshift the d&#8208;band center of Pd and weaken the adsorption energy of O intermediates. Among them, the developed Bi&#8722;Pd metallene shows extraordinarily high ORR mass activity of 11.34&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and 0.86&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V and 0.95&#8197;V in alkaline solution, respectively, representing the best Pd&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts ever reported. In the cathode of a Zinc&#8208;air battery, Bi&#8722;Pd metallene could achieve an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.546&#8197;V and keep stable for 760&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations suggest that the BCT between Pd surface and *OO intermediates greatly affects the bond length between them (dPd&#8208;*OO) and Bi doping could appropriately reduce the amount of BCT and stretch the dPd&#8208;*OO, thus enhancing the ORR activity.

         <title>Palladium(0) and Br&#248;nsted Acid Co&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydro&#8208;Cyclization of 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Hydrazones and Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction of 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes has been developed, through Pd0 and Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation followed by intramolecular allylic amination or etherification. A broad collection of dihydropyrazoles and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively, are constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to furnish multifunctional building blocks.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydro&#8208;functionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has been well explored, but most reactions focus on electron&#8208;neutral substrates in an intermolecular manner. Here we first demonstrate that readily available 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes can be efficiently utilized in the hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction under co&#8208;catalysis of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a chiral palladium complex, furnishing multifunctional dihydropyrazones and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively. Diverse substitution patterns for both types of electron&#8208;deficient diene compounds are tolerated, and corresponding heterocycles were generally constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to access products with higher molecular complexity and diversity. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations support that &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation of dienyl substrates by acid and concurrent &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of Pd0 complex is energetically favoured in the formation of active &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates, and an outer&#8208;sphere allylic amination or etherification mode is adopted to deliver the observed cyclized products enantioselectively.

         <title>Mechanochemically Promoted Functionalization of Postconsumer Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) and Poly(&#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene) for Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable bulk depolymerization by chemically recycling to monomer utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. When sonicated in the presence of a depolymerizable trigger, postconsumer PMMA and PAMS can achieve up to 82&#8201;% depolymerization.

Abstract
We describe a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable subsequent bulk depolymerization to monomer by utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. By harnessing ultrasonic chain&#8208;scission in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide methacrylate (PhthMA), we successfully chain&#8208;end functionalize polymers to promote subsequent depolymerization in bulk, achieving up to 82 % depolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene) (PAMS) within 30&#8197;min. This method of depolymerization yields a high&#8208;purity monomer that can be repolymerized. Moreover, as compared to the most common methods of depolymerization, this work is most efficient with ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers, establishing a method with the potential to address highly persistent, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone plastic materials. Lastly, we demonstrate the expansion of this depolymerization method to commercial cell cast PMMA, achieving high degrees of depolymerization from post&#8208;consumer waste. This work is the first demonstration of applying PhthMA&#8208;promoted depolymerization strategies in homopolymer PMMA and PAMS prepared by conventional polymerization methods.

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of the entire electrooxidation reaction pathway on the Pd single crystal surface can be outlined by obtaining the direct spectroscopic evidence of *OH and *OO intermediates via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that surface&#8208;adsorbed ClO4&#8722; ions can facilitate the deprotonation process of *OH and accelerate the electrooxidation process.







Abstract
The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8722; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8722; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.

         <dc:description>
A general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of various readily available cyclic, acyclic, and benzo&#8208;fused cyclic amines with a series of alkenylborate esters to prepare allylic amines was developed. This protocol features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high E/Z and diastereoselectivities, and good compatibility with water and oxygen. Mechanistic studies suggest that the success of this chemistry relies on the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion.







Abstract
Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conductance increases with length at a significant rate in a series of bis(indeno)acene molecular wires. The rapid shrinking of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap induced by the singlet diradicaloid character of these compounds is responsible for the observed behaviour. These results pave the way to long&#8208;range, efficient coherent tunnelling charge transport.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states&#8212;especially in contact with metallic electrodes&#8212;is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window (

&#177;1.3V

 ${\pm 1.3\ V}$



). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging P and Fe from spent LiFePO4 cathodes, in situ generated PO43&#8722; and NiOOH/Fe3(PO4)2 heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&#8722; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8722; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8722; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NiOOH/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of carbon-neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni-based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine-rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst interfaced with laser-ablated LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L-LFP), derived from spent Li-ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species, formed around L-LFP, effectively repels Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enhances OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high-performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Induced Anti&#8208;Salting&#8208;Out Effect Enabling High Ionic Conductive ZnSO4&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Batteries</title>

A subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. The urea molecules adsorbed on electrode are electropolymerized under voltage to form organic SEI. Such SEI functions as a binder, stabilizing the electrode interface and promoting uniform Zn deposition. Additionally, this SEI layer effectively mitigates side reactions, thereby enhancing the overall electrochemical performance and durability of the electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs) hold great promise in tackling severe issues emerging in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, but the prevalent salting&#8208;out effect of kosmotropic salt causes low ionic conductivity and electrochemical instability. Herein, a subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. By introducing urea containing both an H&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, the broken H&#8208;bonds between PVA and H2O, initiated by the SO42&#8722;&#8208;driven H2O polarization, could be re&#8208;united via intense intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus leading to greatly increased carrying capacity of ZnSO4. The urea&#8208;modified PVA&#8208;ZnSO4 HEs featuring a high ionic conductivity up to 31.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 successfully solves the sluggish ionic transport dilemma at the solid&#8208;solid interface. Moreover, an organic solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase can be derived from the in situ electro&#8208;polymerization of urea to prohibit H2O&#8208;involved side reactions, thereby prominently improving the reversibility of Zn chemistry. Consequently, Zn anodes witness an impressive lifespan extension from 50&#8197;h to 2200&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery maintains a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.7&#8201;%) even after 8000 cycles. The anti&#8208;salting&#8208;out strategy proposed in this work provides an insightful concept for addressing the phase separation issue of functional HEs.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption by Unconventional p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization over Porous High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Metallene for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene was synthesized and demonstrated high performance for electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO). Experimental and theoretical studies validated that unconventional p&#8208;d orbital hybridization could tune the local electronic structure of active sites to manipulate active hydrogen supply, which facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates and promotes the formation of C6H11NO.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO) from cyclohexanone (C6H10O) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a promising alternative to traditional environment&#8208;unfriendly industrial technologies for green synthesis of C6H11NO. Precisely controlling the reaction pathway of the C6H10O/NOx&#8208;involved electrochemical reductive coupling reaction is crucial for selectively producing C6H11NO, which is yet still challenging. Herein, we report a porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene (HEA&#8208;PdCuAgBiInene) to boost the electrosynthesis of C6H11NO from C6H10O and nitrite, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (47.6&#8201;%) and almost 100&#8201;% yield under ambient conditions. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that unconventional orbital hybridization between d&#8208;block metals and p&#8208;block metals could regulate the local electronic structure of active sites and induce electron localization of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, which tunes the active hydrogen supply, facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates NH2OH* and C6H10O*, and efficiently promotes their C&#8722;N coupling to selectively produce C6H11NO.

         <title>Aldehyde End&#8208;Capped Degradable Polyethylenes From Hydrogen&#8208;Controlled Ethylene/CO Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from three large&#8208;scale feedstocks of ethylene + carbon monoxide + hydrogen, direct hydrogen&#8208;controlled non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of CO and ethylene produces aldehyde end&#8208;capped polyethylene (PE) materials with in&#8208;chain isolated keto group, whose molecular weight and chain endgroup could be modulated by H2. Such semicrystalline PE could undergo photodegradation to oily derivatives.







Abstract
To access degradable polyolefin plastic, non&#8208;alternating copolymerization of ethylene (E) and carbon monoxide (CO) for producing polyethylene (PE) with in&#8208;chain ketones is particularly appealing; however, it still presents significant challenges such as molecular weight modulation (hydrogen response) and chain endgroup control (functional terminal). In this study, we achieved hydrogen&#8208;controlled E/CO non&#8208;alternating copolymerization using late transition metal catalysts. This process results in linear PEs containing the desired non&#8208;alternating in&#8208;chain keto groups (1.0&#8211;9.3&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and with tunable molecular weights ranging from 43 to 195&#8197;kDa. In this reaction, H2 serves as a chain transfer agent, modulating the polymer's molecular weight, forming unique aldehyde endgroups and eliminating usual olefinic endgroups; CO undergoes non&#8208;alternating insertion into the PE chain, resulting in a strictly non&#8208;alternating structure (&gt;99&#8201;%) for the keto&#8208;PE. The dispersed incorporation of in&#8208;chain keto groups retains bulk properties of PE and makes PE susceptible to photodegradation, which produces significantly lower molecular weight polymers and oligomers with unambiguous vinyl and acetyl terminals.

Abstract
Given that type I photosensitizers (PSs) possess a good hypoxic tolerance, developing an innovative tactic to construct type I PSs is crucially important, but remains a challenge. Herein, we present a smart molecular design strategy based on the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to develop a type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent with an encouraging amplification effect for accurate hypoxic tumor therapy. Of note, benefiting from the FRET effect, the obtained nanostructured type I PDT agent (NanoPcSZ) with boosted light&#8208;harvesting ability not only amplifies superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8208;) production but also promotes heat generation upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. These features facilitate NanoPcSZ to realize excellent phototherapeutic response under both normal and hypoxic environments. As a result, both in vitro and in vivo experiments achieved a remarkable improvement in therapeutic efficacy via the combined effect of photothermal action and type I photoreaction. Notably, NanoPcSZ can be eliminated from organs (including the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) apart from the tumor site and excreted through urine within 24&#8197;h of its systemic administration. In this way, the potential biotoxicity of drug accumulation can be avoided and the biosafety can be further enhanced.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>How Can Materials Chemists Contribute to Food Supply Security in the Age of AI and Robotics?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint describes the unexpected, underexplored, but essential ways in which the materials chemistry community can contribute to securing the global food supply as it is coming under increasing duress. The piece provides a large number of open fundamental questions for the community to tackle, as well as examples from the recent literature.







Abstract
Global factors are compromising the security of the food supply. Many of us in our community might be unsure about how to help with our seemingly inapplicable expertise. In this piece, I describe how materials chemistry and materials chemists will be essential in addressing this problem, but not only in the way we might think. There is a gigantic and largely unexplored opportunity for real societal impact if we accept a broader view of what academic materials chemistry can be.

         <title>Back Cover: Hidden Impurities Generate False Positives in Single Atom Catalyst Imaging (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated metal atoms of a single&#8208;atom catalyst are represented on the cover as distinct dots, reflecting their usual appearance under a microscope. However, as detailed in the Research Article by Gianvito Vil&#233;, Sean M. Collins et&#8197;al. (e202404883), hidden impurities can lead to false positives in imaging. Accurate differentiation between active catalytic sites (in black) and impurities (in blue) can only be achieved by combining microscopy with in situ electron energy loss spectroscopy, which sets new standards for advanced detection techniques in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Cover Picture: Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mutualistic synthesis concept via orthogonal chemical reactions (disulfide and hydrazone exchange) is reported by Jianwei Li et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202412020). The cover picture describes a "handcuffs" catenane that is formed by a tetrameric disulfide macrocycle and a linear hydrazone. Both species were formed as minor products when the reactions occurred independently, while the mutualistic co&#8208;amplification led to their formation in higher amounts.

Aza&#8208;superbenzene and aza&#8208;supernaphthalene are prepared by Chunyan Chi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202407990). Both compounds can be oxidized into higher oxidation states. The dication and tetracation of aza&#8208;superbenzene exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway. For aza&#8208;supernaphthalene, its dication, tetracation and hexacation display global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity, respectively, with a 54&#960;, 52&#960;, and 50&#960; conjugation pathway.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Triggered Debonding of Mussel&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensitive Adhesives: Improving Efficiency Through Functional Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) can be employed to form strong adhesive polymers, which are debondable by an oxidative trigger. The properties of such polymers can be tuned via the backbone of the monomers. Here, a nature&#8208;inspired peptidic biscatechol is compared to a fossil&#8208;based analogue. The catechol&#8208;amide interactions exhibited by the dipeptide allow for a more efficient debonding mechanism, outperforming the plain catechol oxidation variant.







Abstract
Debondable pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) promise access to recyclability in microelectronics in the transition toward a circular economy. Two PSAs were synthesized from a tetravalent thiol star&#8208;polyester forming thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) with either the biorelated DiDopa&#8208;bisquinone (BY*Q) or the fossil&#8208;based bisquinone A (BQA). The PSAs enable debonding by oxidation of TCC&#8208;catechols to quinones. The extent of debonding efficiency depends on the interaction modes, which are determined by the chemical structure differences of both TCC&#8208;motifs. BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA debonds with exceptional loss of 99&#8201;% of its approx. 2&#8197;MPa shear strength in glass&#8208;on&#8208;glass junctions. For BQA&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA, a debonding efficiency of only approx. 60&#8201;% was found, irrespective of its initial shear strength, which could be tuned up to approx. 7&#8197;MPa. The efficiency of debonding for BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA after TCC&#8208;oxidation is linked to the loss of synergistic interactions without strongly affecting the bulk glue properties, outperforming the purely catechol&#8208;based BQA&#8208;analogue.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Enabled Droplet Biobattery for Powering Synthetic Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A droplet biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signalling when integrated into synthetic tissues.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;enabled biobatteries are promising green options to power the next&#8208;generation of bioelectronics and implantable medical devices. However, existing power sources based on enzymatic biofuel chemistry exhibit limited scale&#8208;down feasibility due to the solid and bulky battery structures. Therefore, miniature and soft alternatives are needed for integration with implants and tissues. Here, a biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. Optimization of the droplet biobattery components ensures a stable output current of ~13,000&#8197;pA for over 24&#8197;h, representing a more than 600&#8208;fold increase in output over previous approaches, including light&#8208;driven processes. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive chemical signal transmission in integrated synthetic tissues.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aminoimines from 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Sulfinylimines by Using Allyl Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is achieved employing chiral bis&#8208;sulfinylimines and allylboronic acids. The exclusive monoallylation occurred at room temperature with complete stereodivergence. The reactivity difference of the spare imine toward allylboronic acids and metal&#8208;based nucleophiles, is a major highlight of this protocol. Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines and &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles were readily accessed from &#945;&#8208;aminoimines.







Abstract
A unique direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is realized, through rapid and exclusive mono&#8208;allylation of chiral bis&#8208;N&#8208;sulfinylimines using allylboronic acids. The highly selective allylation was possible as electrophilic imine functional group in the product &#945;&#8208;aminoimines remained unreactive towards allyl boronic acid nucleophiles. Notably, by varying the geometry and chiral auxiliary, all four isomers of the &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were accessed from readily available precursors. A range of allyl nucleophiles, which are tricky to generate by other means possessing highly reactive functional groups also took part in this reaction, expanding the scope further. The applicability of the products &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were further demonstrated by accessing a range of structurally diverse chiral cyclic and acyclic 1,2&#8208;diamines bearing adjacent stereocenters through addition of a second nucleophile or Prins&#8208;type cyclization by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the tethered alkene moiety. Moreover, the leaving group aptitude of sulfinyl auxiliary attached to imine, was exploited to access valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles under thermal conditions without employing any reagents. Detailed DFT calculation revealed a chair&#8208;like transition state, arising from corresponding allylboroxine species, likely operating for the allylboration reaction across imine.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two&#8208;step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.







Abstract
Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Subsets of Nanometer Vesicles in the Fly Release Differential Fractions of Vesicular Serotonin Content during Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin from neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster was measured using nanoelectrochemical approaches. Differential release fractions were observed upon drug treatment. This is the first example of consistent full release found in any system, suggesting the possibility for one pool of vesicles to release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis.







Abstract
Serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is important in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. Malfunction of serotonin signaling leads to various disorders. We studied serotonin signaling from serotonergic neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster. Serotonergic neurons and stimulated release were visualized and achieved with mCherry and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (an optogenetically transfected ion channel), respectively, and two electrochemical techniques quantified serotonin release and vesicular content. Mean vesicular serotonin content released during exocytosis from these neurons was 84&#8201;%, considerably higher than reported in previous studies regarding octopamine (4.5&#8201;%) and glutamate release (31&#8201;%). Serotonin content within all vesicles is uniformly changed when serotonin concentration is inhibited or enhanced. However, serotonin release exhibits two Gaussian distributions: higher frequency of small release events, and similar or slightly higher frequency of large events, resulting in differential release fractions ranging from partial (13&#8211;18&#8201;%) to full (100&#8201;%) release after treatment with agents to either enhance or diminish release. This is the first example of consistent full exocytotic release events we have observed in any system. We suggest one pool of vesicles can release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis, a potentially novel pathway to regulate exocytosis and neuronal signaling.

         <title>Radical 6&#8208;Endo Addition Enables Pyridine Synthesis under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first radical 6&#8208;endo addition strategy to synthesize pyridines under metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. Experimental and computational studies indicate the critical roles of hypervalent iodine(III) for the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition rather than 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to afford pyridines.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free synthesis of heterocycles is highly sought after in the pharmaceutical industry and has garnered widespread attention due to eliminating the need to remove trace metal catalysts from the reaction. We report a radical 6&#8208;endo addition method for pyridine synthesis from cyclopropylamides and alkynes under metal&#8208;free conditions. Various terminal and substituted alkynes are inserted as C2&#8197;units into cyclopropylamides to synthesize versatile pyridines with 57 examples. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition of vinyl radicals to the imine nitrogen atom rather than the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to the imine carbon atom, in which the hypervalent iodine(III) plays a critical role. This reaction easily scales up with excellent functional group compatibility and suits the late&#8208;stage pyridine installation on complex molecules.

&lt;p&gt;The first radical 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; addition strategy to synthesize pyridines under metal-free conditions is reported. Experimental and computational studies indicate the critical roles of hypervalent iodine(III) for the 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trig&lt;/i&gt; addition rather than 5-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trig&lt;/i&gt; addition to afford pyridines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-free synthesis of heterocycles is highly sought after in the pharmaceutical industry and has garnered widespread attention due to eliminating the need to remove trace metal catalysts from the reaction. We report a radical 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; addition method for pyridine synthesis from cyclopropylamides and alkynes under metal-free conditions. Various terminal and substituted alkynes are inserted as C2&#8197;units into cyclopropylamides to synthesize versatile pyridines with 57 examples. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate the unprecedented 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trig&lt;/i&gt; addition of vinyl radicals to the imine nitrogen atom rather than the conventional 5-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trig&lt;/i&gt; addition to the imine carbon atom, in which the hypervalent iodine(III) plays a critical role. This reaction easily scales up with excellent functional group compatibility and suits the late-stage pyridine installation on complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing the Intermediates Adsorption by Manipulating the Second Coordination Shell of Ir Single Atoms for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Ir single atoms anchored on NiO via different bonding strategies, resulting in diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. The OER activity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number. The improved activity of Ir1&#8722;NiO was attributed to the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni, which weakened the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates.







Abstract
The precise regulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of the second coordination shell. For oxide&#8208;supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms were anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1&#8722;NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number, with Ir1&#8722;NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni in Ir1&#8722;NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.

         <title>Simultaneous Material and Chemical Recycling of Waste PET/PE Multi&#8208;Layer Films under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a hydrothermal process equipped with two filters for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) multi&#8208;layer films. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa, around 100&#8201;% of PET is hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Meanwhile, PE, TPA, and EG are collected separately using the same system, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films is firstly achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;layer plastic films are widely used in various fields especially for packaging, but due to complex composition, it is very difficult to recover single&#8208;material polymers or high&#8208;purity monomers from them after usage. In this study, we proposed a hydrothermal process for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) films. PET can be hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Using a hydrothermal system equipped with two filters, PE, TPA, and EG were collected separately, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films was firstly achieved. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa for 60&#8197;min, PET conversion reached around 100&#8201;%, and TPA yield of 83.0&#8201;% was obtained with a high TPA purity of 96.1&#8201;%. In addition, the effect of the holding time on PET conversion, TPA yield, EG yield, and TPA purity was studied. This research opened up a new and sustainable pathway to recycle multi&#8208;layer plastic films in both lab and industry.

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Ampere&#8208;level propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) is achieved over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) in a membraneless reactor, in virtue of the synergetic combination of both the penetration effect and the spatial&#8208;coupling strategy, exhibiting specificity propylene oxide (PO) production of over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency (FEPO) and a maximum 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 PO partial current density (jPO), with significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.







Abstract
The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to ampere level (achieving over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 Sites Coupling Atop&#8208;type and Bridge&#8208;type Adsorbed *C1 for Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 site leads to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure and the regulation of adsorption strength of several key adsorbates, reaching the simultaneous atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion.







Abstract
2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8722;O4 or M&#8722;N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8722;N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT&#8208;119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT&#8208;119 could reach a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8722;O4 units, asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 units lead to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion. This work broadens the feasible C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.

Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or M&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units) and product selectivity (common CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit is constructed, labeled as BIT-119. When applied to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, BIT-119 could reach a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units, asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units lead to the re-distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites could simultaneously couple the atop-type (on Cu site) and bridge-type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; species to reach the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. This work broadens the feasible C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unbiased Photoelectrochemical H2O2 Coupled to H2 Production via Dual Sb2S3&#8208;Based Photoelectrodes with Ultralow Onset Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial photosynthesis with a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 and a photocathode of H2 by one sun illumination as the only energy input was developed on Sb2S3 photoelectrodes.







Abstract
The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. Moreover, the formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an outstanding average FE of 85&#8201;% in the potential range of 0.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 at 1.6&#8197;VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8211;0.55&#8197;VRHE with 80.4&#8201;% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both the Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3 photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 without applying any addition bias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.

         <title>Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mutualistic synthesis concept via orthogonal chemical reactions: disulfide and hydrazone exchange. A tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide exchange catalyzed the otherwise inert hydrazone exchange, amplifying a linear hydrazone and forming &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenanes through noncovalent binding. The co&#8208;amplification of both species resembles mutualism in ecosystems, as they were minor species when the reactions occurred independently.







Abstract
Mutualisms are interactions that benefit all species involved. It has been widely investigated in neighbouring subjects, such as biology, ecology, sociology, and economics. However, such a reciprocal relationship in synthetic chemical systems has rarely been studied. Here, we demonstrate a mutualistic synthesis where byproducts from two orthogonal chemical reactions aid each other&#8242;s production. Disulfide exchange and hydrazone exchange were chosen to generate two dynamic combinatorial libraries. A minor tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide library was quantitatively amplified in the presence of the hydrazone library. This incorporation also turned on the previously inert hydrazone reaction, producing a linear species that formed a &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenane with the disulfide tetramer. These findings not only lend robust support to the hypothesis of &#8220;RNA&#8208;peptide coevolution&#8221; for the origin of life but also broaden the scope of synthetic chemistry, highlighting the untapped potential of minor products from different reactions. Additionally, the co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of these mutualistic entities to form supramolecular structures opens new avenues for future development of composite nanosystems with synergistic properties.

         <title>Radiocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid from CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C coupling of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH) represents a highly atom&#8208;efficient chemical conversion, fostering the comprehensive utilization of greenhouse gases. This study reveals that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) produced by water radiolysis can effectively activate CH4 and CO2, yielding methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3) and carbon dioxide radical anions (&#8901;CO2&#8722;) that facilitate the production of CH3COOH at ambient temperature. The introduction of radiation&#8208;synthesized CuO&#8208;anchored TiO2 bifunctional catalyst could further enhance reaction efficiency and selectivity remarkably by boosting radiation absorption and radical stability, resulting in a concentration of 7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CH3COOH with high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%).







Abstract
The C&#8722;C coupling of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH) represents a highly atom&#8208;efficient chemical conversion, fostering the comprehensive utilization of greenhouse gases. However, the inherent thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CH4 and CO2 present obstacles to achieving efficient and selective conversion at room temperature. Our study reveals that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) produced by water radiolysis can effectively activate CH4 and CO2, yielding methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3) and carbon dioxide radical anions(&#8901;CO2&#8722;) that facilitate the production of CH3COOH at ambient temperature. The introduction of radiation&#8208;synthesized CuO&#8208;anchored TiO2 bifunctional catalyst could further enhance reaction efficiency and selectivity remarkably by boosting radiation absorption and radical stability, resulting in a concentration of 7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CH3COOH with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%).

         <title>Path&#8208;Independent All&#8208;Visible Orthogonal Photoswitching for Applications in Multi&#8208;Photochromic Polymers and Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208;independent orthogonal photoswitching has been achieved by combining peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based photoswitch. Four persistent colors can be interchanged by irradiation with light and could be transferred to a multi&#8208;photochromic transparent polymer material. The addition of a third fluorophore component enables advanced all&#8208;photonic logic operations.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular photoswitches have taken center stage as high&#8208;precision tools to introduce light&#8208;responsiveness at the smallest scales. Today they are found in all areas of applied chemistry, covering materials research, chemical biology, catalysis, or nanotechnology. For a next step of applicability truly orthogonal photoswitching is highly desirable but to date such independent addressability of different photoswitches remains highly challenging. Herein we present the first example of all&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208; independent orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches &#8208; peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based chromophore &#8208; a four&#8208;state system is established and each state can be accessed in high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix to yield a versatile multi&#8208;state photochromic material. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as a third component is possible, demonstrating the applicability of this orthogonal photoswitching system in all&#8208;photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Euphordraculoate A and Pedrolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total syntheses of euphordraculoate A and pedrolide were accomplished through a cascade involving Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization. This cascade is consistent with our proposal for the biogenetic relationship between euphordraculoate A and pedrolide.







Abstract
Here we report the asymmetric total syntheses of two rearranged tigliane diterpenoids, euphordraculoate A and pedrolide. A reductive dihydroxylation cascade and Nazarov cyclization were performed to generate euphordraculoate A, which was subjected to a cascade of Eu&#8208;promoted dienyl enolization, intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and enol&#8208;ketone tautomerization to afford pedrolide, a pathway consistent with our proposal for the biogenesis of pedrolide.

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via Formal Single Electron Reduction of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes under Photochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) starting from azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) and styrenes under photochemical conditions is reported. The reaction follows a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy in which the key step is a photocatalytic atom&#8208;transfer&#8208;radical&#8208;addition (ATRA) reaction.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;rich heterocycles are privileged building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Therefore, synthetic methods that provide access to novel saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are in high demand. Herein, we report a general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) via a formal cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) with styrenes under photochemical conditions. To overcome the challenging direct single electron reduction of ABBs, we designed a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy that leverages a fast acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening of ABBs to form bromoazetidines, which undergo efficient debrominative radical formation to initiate the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction is applicable to a broad range of ABB&#8208;ketones and we demonstrate the 1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH products can be further functionalized to access larger saturated, conformationally rigid heterocycles.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;catalysis Mechanism Elucidation by Tracking Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide with In situ EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 44, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative in situ EPR monitoring strategy is introduced to investigate the active species involved in the ORR&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 pathways by electro&#8208;, photo&#8208; and piezo&#8208;catalysis. The formation of immediate species in piezo&#8208;catalysis is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis, offering prospective evidence to support the choice of mechanism for piezo&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory or the screening charge effect which are similar to mechanisms of photocatalysis and electrochemical catalysis, respectively. Due to the formation of different intermediate active&#8208;species during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and piezo&#8208;catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB&#8208;OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo&#8208;catalysis over BOB&#8208;OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo&#8208;catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo&#8208;catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>A Double&#8208;walled Noncovalent Carbon Nanotube by Columnar Packing of Nanotube Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through host&#8211;guest complexation of nanotube fragments and tube&#8208;forming crystal engineering. As the smallest fragment of double&#8208;walled CNTs, a host&#8211;guest complex of perfluorocycloparaphenylene (PFCPP) and carbon nanobelt (CNB) was synthesized by mixing them in solvents. The immediate complexation of the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex with a remarkably high association constant (Ka) of 2&#215;105 L/mol was observed. Time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR and thermogravimetry measurements revealed that the stability of (6,6)CNB was significantly improved by encapsulation. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the robust belt&#8208;in&#8208;ring structure of this complex. As indicated by the short distance between PF[12]CPP and (6,6)CNB (2.8 &#197;), intermolecular orbital interactions exist between the belt and the ring, which were further supported by theoretical calculation and phosphorescence quenching experiments. While the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent CNT structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Hollow Structure with Chemotaxis Enabling Intratumoral Autonomic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective intratumoral drug penetration is pivotal for successful cancer treatment. However, due to the disrupted capillary networks and poor perfusion in solid tumors, there exist challenges to realize autonomous directional drug penetration and controlled drug release within the tumor. Considering the specificity of glucose within tumor tissue, we draw inspiration from nature and engineer asymmetrical hollow structures exhibiting chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. By incorporating multiple shells into these structures, we enhance the local chemical concentration gradients, thereby improving cellular uptake and precise targeting. The advantages of anisotropic hollow multishell structure (a&#8208;HoMS) can be reflected from the diffusion coefficient and directivity, which increase by 73.4% and 265% respectively compared to conventional isotropic hollow spheres, achieving the most linear movement while ensuring the speed of movement. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;level porosity and temporal&#8208;spatial order of a&#8208;HoMS enable sequential drug delivery that inhibits angiogenesis with inducing cell apoptosis. After the eradication of localized tumor cells, the a&#8208;HoMS can automatically migrate to the alive tumor cells under the glucose gradient, inducing another cycle of drug delivery and chemotaxis, resulting in excellent antitumor efficacy. These anisotropic HoMS demonstrate intelligence, adaptability, and precision in tumor therapy, providing valuable insights for programmable treatment within tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural and Functional Mimic of P680+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One or multiple chlorophyll molecules are employed in the reaction center of photosystem II's main electron donor (defined as P680). We have a poor understanding of how the reaction center facilitates water oxidation and the roles that mono&#8208; and/or multimeric chlorophyll groups play when P680 oxidizes a neighboring tyrosine in order to drive water oxidation at the oxygen evolving complex. We have prepared a dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4&#8208;BTPP = 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one&#8208;electron to the corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, FT&#8208;IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII&#8208;porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;&#8208;cation radical species.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8209;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8209;hydroxyamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Genome Mining Facilitates the Discovery of a Promiscuous, Hyperthermostable Amidase from Thermovenabulum gondwanense with Notable Nylon&#8208;Degrading Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are ubiquitous in our ecosystems, and microplastic accumulation in the environment is an emerging global health concern. Since available recycling technologies are not economically competitive with primary plastic production, global use is expected to reach 1231 megatons by 2060, with 493 megatons leeching into the environment each year. To identify new nylon&#8208;recycling biotechnologies, targeted genome mining was used to identify thermostable enzymes capable of degrading polyamides. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel protein sourced from Thermovenabulum gondwanense: TvgC. TvgC is extremely stable, exhibiting a melting temperature of 93 &#176;C and no detectable losses in hydrolytic activity after one week at 60 &#176;C. While nylonases primarily process nylon&#8208;6, TvgC catalysed the degradation of both nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6 films, which are considerably more difficult to degrade. Finally, conversion experiments demonstrate that TvgC achieves a 1.2 wt% conversion of nylon&#8208;6 film, comparable to that of the most highly engineered nylonases. This novel hyperthermostable protein represents an excellent starting point for future engineering of increasingly efficient nylonases.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infinite&#8208;Chain Polymers with Ge=Ge Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite considerable interest in heteroatom&#8208;containing conjugated polymers, there are only few examples with heavier p&#8208;block elements in the conjugation path. The recently reported heavier acyclic diene metathesis (HADMET) allowed for the synthesis of a polymer containing Ge=Ge double bonds &#8211; albeit insoluble and with limited degree of polymerization. By incorporation of long alkyl chains, we now obtained soluble representatives, which exhibit degrees of polymerization near infinity according to diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Analyses of the UV/Vis absorption and the NMR spectroscopic data confirm the presence of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation across the silylene&#8208;phenylene linkers between the Ge=Ge double bonds. Favorable intermolecular dispersion interactions lead to ladder&#8208;like cylindrical supramolecular assemblies as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and DLS. AFM and TEM images of deposited thin films reveal lamellar ordering of extended polymer bundles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Discrete Four&#8208;Stranded &#946;&#8208;Sheet through Catenation of M2L2 Metal&#8211;Peptide Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for precisely constructing a &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly with number&#8208;defined strands in solution remains quite limited due to its intense aggregation property. Here, we report the precise construction of a four&#8208;stranded anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet by utilizing a non&#8208;covalent approach. This was achieved by folding and assembly of Ag+ and a pentapeptide (1) with the Ala&#8208;D3pa&#8208;Gly&#8208;3pa&#8208;Val (3pa: &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;alanine) sequence, which was designed to form an interlocking Ag2(1)2 ring through metal cross&#8208;linking of the side chains. NMR analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies characterized the structure of the discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly as well as the remarkable structural selectivity in terms of strands&#8217; number, orientation and the sheet type.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Raman Probing of the Intrinsic Electric Field for High&#8208;Efficiency Screening of Electricity&#8208;Producing Bacteria at the Single&#8208;Cell Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of high&#8208;performance microbial fuel cells requires the evaluation of the activity of electrochemically active bacteria. However, this is challenging because of the time&#8208;consuming nature of biofilm formation and the invasive nature of labeling. To address this issue, we developed a fast, label&#8208;free, single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method. This method involves investigating the &#8220;pure&#8221; linear Stark effect of endogenous CO in the silent region of biological samples, which allows for probing the intrinsic electric field in the outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes of live bacterial cells. We found that reduced outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes can generate an additional intrinsic electric field equivalent to an applied potential of +0.29 V. We also found that the higher the electrical activity of the cell, the larger the generated electric field. This was also reflected in the output current of the constructed microbial fuel cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to facilitate the assessment of electrochemical activity at the single&#8208;cell level in highly&#8208;diluted bacterial samples. After analysis, inactive bacteria were ablated by laser heating, and 20 active cells were cultured for further testing. The rapid and high&#8208;throughput probing of the intrinsic electric field offers a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency screening of electrochemically active bacterial cells for bioenergetic and photosynthetic research.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Spin&#8208;State of Cobalt in Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Iodine Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the catalytic activity is heavily reliant on the electronic structure of the catalyst, understanding the impact of electron spin regulation on electrocatalytic performance is still rarely investigated. This work presents a novel approach involving the single&#8208;atom coordination of cobalt (Co) within metalloporphyrin&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) to facilitate the catalytic conversion for sodium&#8208;iodine batteries. The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that CoII and CoIII are incorporated into the 3D&#8208;COFs, exhibiting spin ground states of S = 1/2 and S = 0, respectively. The low spin state of CoIII is favorable to hybridize with the sp 3d orbitals of I3&#8208;, thus facilitating the conversion of I3&#8208; to I&#8208;. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the presence of CoIII enhances iodide adsorption and accelerates the formation of NaI in 3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII, thereby promoting its rapid kinetic behaviors. Notably, the I2@3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of 227.7 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and demonstrates exceptional cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 10 C with a minor capacity fading rate of less than one 0.01% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Dioxide Catalyzed Polymerization of N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) and Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) marks a milestone in the development of&#160;conducting polymers. Currently, n&#8208;PBDF is prepared by either duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, where scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness may present challenges. Here, we report a general, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for n&#8208;PBDF and its derivatives, namely selenium dioxide (SeO2) catalyzed polymerization. We discovered that a catalytic amount of selenium dioxide leads to high monomer conversions (&gt;99% by NMR). The obtained n&#8208;PBDF exhibits a consistently narrow hydrodynamic diameter distribution and its thin films show high conductivities. Furthermore, we revealed that this polymerization involves a mechanism distinct from the previously reported radical pathway. It involves successive Riley oxidation and aldol polycondensation processes. It was also found that the reduced selenium precipitates from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) when the catalytic cycle is terminated, allowing for a straightforward purification process through centrifugation and filtration. This method thus eliminates the need for the costly and slow dialysis process. Finally, we demonstrated that SeO2 catalyzed polymerization is applicable to n&#8208;PBDF derivatives, proving the generality of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen-containing renewable feedstocks (e.g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming-induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual-cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol-to-hydrocarbons process.

         <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Triagonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm&#8208;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Active Sites of Metal/Metal Oxide Catalysts by Oxide Ligand Overlayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering sites of supported metal catalysts is essential to enhancing activity and selectivity. Such enhancement is typically achieved by particle size modification, surface alloying, or attaching molecular ligands. Yet, control strategies for complex, multifunctional molecules and catalysts, where selectivity is crucial, are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that submonolayer WOx with tunable coverage preferentially decorates well&#8208;coordinated Pt terrace sites as a stable ligand. By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first&#8208;principles modeling, we show that the WOx coverage on Pt modifies the metal&#8208;to&#8208;acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal&#8208;acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support&#8208;dependent WOx coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8208;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8208;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8208;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8208;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6 mA cm&#8208;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8208;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and DFT calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8226;&#8211;) = +1.67 V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products.

However, the use of solid-state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black-box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid-state conjugated organic polymer, poly-(para-phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8226;&#8211;) = +1.67 V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited-state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three-component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;-acylaminoamides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen&#8217;s outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end&#8208;to&#8208;end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyethylene Recycling Via Water Activation By Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most prevalent type of plastic waste and also the most challenging to depolymerize because of its inert carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) bonds.[1] High temperature and noble metals are usually required for depolymerization.[2] To avoid using noble metals, costly reagents and harsh reaction conditions, it is worthwhile but challenging to explore new reaction pathways.[3] We report an unprecedented mechanochemical reaction of PE and water to result in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and ketones (Cn, where n &#8818; 50), with above 80 % of starting carbon converted into these products, which could be a valuable feedstock for re&#8208;entering chemical value chains. This reaction is driven solely by ball milling, without heating and pressurizing. No costly catalysts are used. Instead, only earth&#8208;abundant Al&#8322;O&#8323; was milled with reactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and C&#8210;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8210;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8210;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8210;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Monomeric Triarylbismuthine Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of a bismuth&#8208;based analogue of the venerable triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3PO) has remained a chimera to synthetic chemists for many years, due to its predicted high reactivity and instability. Through the hydrolysis of a cationic fluorotriarylbismuthonium(V) salt, we report here the isolation of unique hydroxytriarylbismuth(V) complexes, which served as precursor for the formation of the elusive monomeric triarylbismuthine oxide Dipp3Bi&#9552;O. Combined spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies provided insight into the bonding situation of the first monomeric triorganobismuth oxide complex. The Dipp3Bi&#9552;O and Mes3BiO&#183;LiBArF complex exhibits O&#8208;atom transfer reactivity, an uncommon reactivity feature for Ar3Pn=O.</dc:description>

         <title>Fuel&#8208;driven&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated Superstructures to Form Transient Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels. Upon fueling the NDI&#8208;derived fibers, a dual&#8208;component activation and deactivation pathway is deduced by kinetic analysis and is absent when using a molecularly dissolved resting state. Investigating the solid&#8208;state morphologies of the structures formed throughout the fuel&#8208;driven reaction cycle using cryo&#8208;EM reveals that the resting thermodynamic fibers evolve to transient thicker fibrils and layered superstructures. We show that the transient redox&#8208;active hydrogels exhibit a nearly threefold increase in electrical conductivity upon fuel consumption before reverting to their original value over hours. These far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium materials are potential candidates in applications such as programmable biorobotics and chemical computing.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MoO 3 &#160;by Surface Oxidation of Mo 2 C (MXene) for Stable Near&#8208;Surface Reactions in Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a promising positive electrode material for aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity. However, MoO3&#160;faces several challenges in an aqueous electrolyte, such as easy dissolution of reaction products, volume expansion, and low conductivity, which severely limit its application in aqueous batteries. In this work, we effectively increased the overall conductivity of the electrode by in&#8208;situ growing MoO3&#160;on the Mo2C MXene layer. MXene can effectively inhibit the dissolution and structural loss of MoO3&#160;reaction products. Additionally, the coordination effect of Mo2C and MoO3&#160;achieves a stable near&#8208;surface reaction on the MXene laminates, resulting in the Mo2C/MoO3&#160;composite exhibiting excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.4 A/g). The energy storage mechanism of H+/Al3+&#160;co&#8208;insertion/extraction was elucidated through non&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterization, and the promotion effect of Mo2C on MoO3&#160;reaction kinetics was verified by density functional theory calculations. This work provides new insights into improving the stability of AAIB cathodes and extends the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>De(sulfon)amidative Cyclization: The Synthesis of Dibenzolactams and Dibenzosultams for Organic Light Emitting Diode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study addresses a challenge in organic synthetic chemistry: the direct cleavage of amide bonds, which is typically hampered by the thermodynamic stability of the C(Ar)&#8211;C(acyl) bond. Previous methods often rely on &#8220;CO&#8221; extrusion&#8208;jointing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed process and require activated tertiary amides, limiting their applicability due to incompatibility with reactive functional groups such as halogens. Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free approach for the deamidative cyclization of biaryl diamides via a radical process, yielding dibenzolactam derivatives. Along this line, we have developed the desulfonamidative cyclization of biaryl disulfonamides to produce dibenzosultams through direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution, demonstrating high selectivity for unsymmetrical structures. Additionally, unsymmetrical sulfamoyl biaryl amides, containing both amide and sulfonamide functionalities, can selectively undergo desulfonamidative coupling with the amide to form dibenzolactams, which offers a complementary synthetic pathway to unsymmetric dibenzolactams. These protocols exhibit excellent compatibility with reactive functional groups, including halogens, providing an innovative synthetic toolbox for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). DMAC&#8208;PDO, incorporating a dibenzolactam as the acceptor unit, serves as an efficient blue TADF emitter with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 23.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250 cycles with 81.4% capacity retention when charged to 4.8 V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000 cycles if charged to 4.6 V (vs. Li+/Li).&#160;&#160;Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Monocyclic Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compact luminophores with long emission wavelengths have aroused considerable theoretical and practical interest. Organics with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were attached to the 4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini&#8208;phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162 g&#183;mol&#8208;1, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750 nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485 cm&#8208;1 (403 nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>A Grafting Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Benchmark Selectivity of C2H2/CO2 Separation under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0 V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution.&#160;To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0 V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu.&#160;The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100 % at 0.10 V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>[5]Helicene Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles with Persistent Figure&#8208;Eight and M&#246;bius Shapes: Efficient Synthesis, Chiral Resolution and Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons hold great potential as chiroptical materials, though their synthesis remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present a simple approach using Suzuki coupling of a [5]helicene building block with various aromatic units, enabling the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of chiral macrocycles with persistent figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Single&#8208;crystal structures of 7 compounds were solved, and 22 enantiomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC. A notable pyrene&#8208;bridged figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, with its rigid, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and overcrowded structure, exhibited pure excimer emission and outstanding circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, including a large dissymmetric factor (|glum| = 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and significant CPL brightness (BCPL = 710.5 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1). This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for producing various chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles and singly or triply twisted M&#246;bius macrocycles with C2 and D3 symmetry, offering tunable chiroptical properties for CPL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero)arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.</dc:description>
